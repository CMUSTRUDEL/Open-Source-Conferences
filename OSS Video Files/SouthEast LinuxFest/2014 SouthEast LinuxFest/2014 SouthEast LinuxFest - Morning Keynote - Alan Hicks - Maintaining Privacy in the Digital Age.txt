00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,289
point out in the expo hall there will be

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,610
a little quick anonymous info survey

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,670
kind of thing where you can get a raffle

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,079
ticket for that not up yet just sort of

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,320
keep looking around for it in the hall

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,630
it'll appear eventually I'm pleased to

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,299
introduce sort of the if you haven't met

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,640
Alan before if the Hat hasn't given it

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,770
away in the swagger isms and the accent

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,869
Alan takes you may at least recognize

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,140
his voice as the voiceover for all of

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,290
our videos and audio we release Alan

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,240
hails from the yet unrecognized republic

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,430
of georgia which has in fact seceded you

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,200
just don't know it yet and he's an

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,909
all-around good guy and helps a lot with

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
the conference behind the scenes so if

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,350
you see him in the bar buy him a beer if

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,000
he isn't already double fisting so

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,000
without any further ado Alan Hicks

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,050
don't let the double fist and stop you

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,410
so here we are maintaining privacy in

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,770
the digital age I just wrote up there

00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:02,770
who are mine why do I care but Jeremy

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,150
just told you if you weren't paying

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:12,430
attention and you're not going to get it

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:17,380
again so why does this matter we have so

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,720
many people thinking about I mean how

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,140
much of our lives is online now compared

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,350
to five years ago or ten years ago I

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,950
mean 10 years ago 2004 we have so very

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:32,800
little and then you go back another five

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,020
years before that and you're into 1999

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,209
and sep tember 11th won't happen for two

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,910
more years and no one is thinking about

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,040
anything and really you're the people

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:48,040
for the most part don't think about

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:50,530
these things today so with all the

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,390
various things that come down in the

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,670
past year it's it's something that we

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,530
need to at least have a public

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,160
discussion about even if we don't agree

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:03,010
on what should be done or even what is

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,070
currently being done we should at least

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:11,560
discuss this openly and see if we can't

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:13,180
get to some sort of solutions and what

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,260
can we do about it that's the solution

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,570
part and unfortunately the answer is

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,170
sometimes not a whole lot and sometimes

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,850
it's you know a little more and then

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,769
sometimes it depends upon whether we're

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,209
acting as individuals or for acting as

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,910
groups I'm going to try to keep the

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,269
politics as far out of this as possible

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,950
but you know this is by its nature given

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,010
what's been going on the last year

00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,780
somewhat a political discussion but you

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,700
may may not agree with me so I'm going

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,040
to try to keep my personal things out of

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,740
it and when I do get that all pointed

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,400
out as much as I can

00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:58,040
so let's move right in and get started

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,020
with a I've already gone over that so I

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,980
won't go over it again Jeremy did that

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,430
good enough so why does your digital

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,930
privacy matter and the unfortunate

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,330
answer is because we all have something

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,350
to hide is there anybody here raise your

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:22,030
hand who does not have something to hide

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:23,870
liar the next thing is part of my

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,670
personal beliefs because we are

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,830
sovereign individuals with inherent

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,660
human right to on our personal

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,310
information and that sovereign

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,200
individuals is the thing where you're

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,950
going to get into some political stuff

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,900
with make us a view rights as a innate

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,140
part of the human condition that should

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,450
not be taken away for really any any

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:50,660
reason or at least without a really good

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,860
one because the information is power I'm

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,270
just going to let that one stand for

00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,950
itself if you disagree with that fine go

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,800
get your sword I'll get my pen because

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,030
power is always eventually abused that's

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,040
another one of my personal political

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,720
things I guess but I think history bears

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,810
me out on that and I think anyone who

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,260
studies will agree that we human beings

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,770
can be pretty doggone awful when we're

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,080
giving control over other folks and

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,740
because anonymity frees people to act in

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,460
ways that are sometimes necessary and or

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,320
unacceptable to others that might be

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,770
perhaps the most controversial statement

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,140
here you know people think you always

00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,890
hear well I don't have anything to hide

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,750
and let's let's assume you know that you

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:45,260
actually believe you don't have

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,080
something to hide there are times when

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:53,030
uh you know good people do things that

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:56,030
are clearly against the law a great

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,390
example and this is almost a Godwin

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,879
situation here uh you look at someone

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:05,759
like Harriet Tubman for instance

00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,610
breaking the law one hundred percent for

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,280
all the right reasons you know the law

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,659
itself is not always correct is not

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,300
always moral it is you know sometimes

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:23,340
legal criminal activity or at least

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:27,180
legal immoral activity so being

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:30,479
anonymous or at least being a little bit

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,580
more secure in our persons allows us a

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:40,169
little bit more freedom of action in

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,400
these sorts of things so what can we do

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,500
about these things that is the

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,610
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question if

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,280
you do not remember the

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:51,060
sixty-four-thousand-dollar pyramid

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:55,740
you're even older than I am at a group

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,940
level options are kind of limited these

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,400
sort of things that they require

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,800
political change and probably cultural

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,909
change I'm reminded of Bruce Snyder

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,779
brilliant fella and I probably just

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:12,900
butchered his name he was talking about

00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,240
in his cryptogram thing about the

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,949
full-body scanners at airports everybody

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,590
remember the controversy when all that

00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,389
stuff was going through and he said

00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,800
something along the lines of this is

00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:27,990
what's going to get the American people

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,669
to rebel against these increadibly you

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,469
know people are going to be taken you

00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,029
know snapshots of them without their

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:35,039
clothes on every time they try to board

00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,719
a play and there's going to be patent

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,419
hounds and stuff and what we really

00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:43,289
found out is that the American people

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:46,110
will roll over and take it for the most

00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:49,469
part it's just the way it is and if we

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,150
want to change that that probably is

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,409
going to require some sort of cultural

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,599
change at the individual level though

00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,190
because we don't have to band together

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,900
with other people we don't have to form

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,539
any sort of consensus we can just act

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,060
unilaterally we have more freedom to do

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:10,819
things that will not necessarily protect

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,819
all of us but can protect ourselves

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,410
and finally you know just knowing what

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,020
threats exist empower us will never go

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:23,340
about the knowledge is power and the

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:26,280
more we learn the better equipped we are

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,480
to face reality on its own terms and to

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,930
come up with some sort of decent

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:38,099
solution so I kind of break the types of

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,630
threats down into three groups and so

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,910
fast I'm going here because I'm probably

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:47,760
oh yeah i'm going to mighty fast good we

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,860
have a date of muggers everybody's heard

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,010
the term ironmongers these are people

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,320
who make you know missiles and guns and

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,580
stuff for the military and their war

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,160
mongers or ironmongers data mongers they

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,150
don't make iron they make data or at

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,370
least collect it gather farm then we

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,440
have a middleman these are the people

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,530
who sort of sit in the middle and you've

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,890
got your intelligence services and I'll

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,170
get them on a moment but your data

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,180
mongers these are predominantly things

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:25,430
like social media and online service

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:29,280
providers things like Gmail Facebook

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,110
blah blah and their business plan

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,300
revolves at least partially around

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,930
gathering data on you and doing

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:41,070
something with that data the benign

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,170
cases are to serve ads taylor te if

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,780
anybody ever watches this week in tech

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,780
or listens to it you know there was like

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,920
a couple two or three weeks ago Larry

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,720
laporte was on there and they were

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,320
talking about this and he came along the

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,820
line if I don't care how much amazon or

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,010
how much Google knows about me they're

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,040
just using this to serve ads Taylor to

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,680
me if I'm you know buying a lot of

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,020
gardening supplies I'm more interested

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,500
in seeing an advertisement about a

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:14,790
fertilizer than I am about I don't know

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,490
a car something but

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,380
there are more malignant cases that even

00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,920
if they aren't going on now you can

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:30,690
easily imagine happening in the future

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:34,360
these were the data company is set up to

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:37,150
essentially sell information about you

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,220
to other people who may or may not be as

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:44,170
benign about it then we've got middlemen

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,880
these people know more about you than

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,680
anybody else if they care to learn these

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,610
are things like your ISP your wireless

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,040
carrier these sorts of things they their

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,820
business plan is to provide you access

00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,160
to content to facilitate you getting

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,370
whatever it is you want since they

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,400
facilitate that transaction they

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,840
essentially see it off or at least see

00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,690
that something's going on and since they

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,850
facilitate all these things they

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,650
potentially know more about you and your

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:24,600
habits than anybody else it's easy to

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:27,490
see how Facebook knows some stuff about

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,910
you that you stick on Facebook it's easy

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,530
to see how Google knows something you do

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,570
when you go to Google and how this has

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:38,380
gotten better cuz these services are

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,850
encrypted now but you know just for

00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,610
argument's sake let's say that's all

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,260
sentient plain text Facebook has its

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,080
world over here and Google has this

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,810
world over here but in the middle you

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:55,510
have your ISP who is facilitating both

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:59,010
things and they see all of it since

00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:02,110
their business plan at least ostensibly

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,530
Comcast revolves around providing access

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,290
to content you know that they might not

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,870
be interested in selling your data but

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:14,320
they almost certainly have data of

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,530
interest to other people and we see this

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,660
you know with things like the NSA or

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:24,339
some other government agency going to

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,759
say 18 to verizon or something saying we

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,350
want to tap on these parts because that

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,259
date is of interest to those

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,540
organizations for whatever reason right

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:37,779
or wrong legitimate illegitimate not

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,829
going to get in that debate just say you

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,990
know they certainly have access to it so

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,629
even if they're not actively an enemy

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:51,459
you need to at least treat them I guess

00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:53,319
as a suspicious character and finally we

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:57,999
have our intelligence services these are

00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:59,889
you know NSA CIA FBI mi6 f is if you

00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:03,730
don't know what that is that's the KGB

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:05,910
successor Israel's Mossad everybody's

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,689
got one or two or three of them

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,949
sometimes more ostensibly they're you

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,749
know they're to protect you against

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:15,759
violence foreign and domestic you know

00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:20,249
we're protecting you against terrorists

00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,300
little above you know that's the line

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,980
but they probably don't have your best

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,629
interest in mind and if you don't

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,819
believe me ask Angela Merkel if you

00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,860
don't know who that is that's Germany's

00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,240
Prime Minister Germany is this country

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:41,350
that's on the other side of a great big

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:43,029
salt hog and NSA apparently you know tap

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,670
your phone or maybe it was CIA or

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:49,179
whatever because you know they want to

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,189
spy on her for whatever reason so even

00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:53,370
if you trust your own country's agencies

00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:56,110
even if you trust you know the NSA to

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,059
you know we're protecting you from

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,040
terrorists we're just you know throwing

00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:02,800
out the fishing net the dragonet we're

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,160
looking for you know the the next osama

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,679
bin laden the next Timothy McVeigh whose

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,809
name never gets mentioned anymore we're

00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:16,540
looking for the next sorry I of brothers

00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:19,089
can you say the same thing about Russian

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,129
FIS if they're looking at your data are

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:24,160
they looking at for the same reason what

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:28,540
about North Korea's they're a great

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,339
boogeyman Iran you know are there you

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,559
know intelligence services looking at

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,629
the same thing for those same reasons

00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,950
well probably not because they're

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,740
different political entities would

00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,960
different political motivations so even

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,980
if you can trust your own or your allies

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,230
like em out six you can't trust them all

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,280
and we have to operate under the

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:55,340
assumption that if our government can do

00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,940
it today other governments can at least

00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,520
do it tomorrow you know they might not

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:06,230
you know have the funding quite the

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,420
access and stuff today but if they don't

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,610
they've got to be catching up pretty

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,440
quick you would think I mean that's only

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,420
logical technology always gets better

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,070
attacks always get better they don't get

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,850
worse that's sort of a truism of

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:29,720
Technology and period so we have to

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,700
treat them as hostile service assembly

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,850
because you know what we said even if

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,650
you do trust yours today can you say

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:42,520
that you will trust them tomorrow and

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:46,280
there there are plenty of examples where

00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,500
you've got good people who are being

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,770
targeted even in this country by their

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,620
all domestic services like j edgar

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:58,100
Hoover's FBI targeting Martin Luther

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:00,680
King jr. and doing all kinds of nice

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,200
things like creating a sex tape of him

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,690
and then you know hanging it over his

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,340
head to say we're going to send this to

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:11,540
your wife if you don't you know stop

00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,280
being up at ian's things like that it's

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,130
not that difficult today to see that

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,840
same sort of thing happening again

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,600
especially giving you know we torture

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:26,930
people and things so that's basically a

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:29,720
step down so given these three types of

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,330
threats what can we do about it and at

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,320
the public level as far as I see the

00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,790
answer is not much the problem is like I

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,940
said earlier when we were talking about

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,910
the full-body scanners and Airport pat

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,650
downs and stuff we find out that huge

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,490
portion of American people just roll

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:51,190
over and take

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:56,079
and that's quite unfortunate in my

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:59,589
opinion any sort of progress at the

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,209
political level at the public level it's

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:04,150
going to take some sort of concerted

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:07,150
grassroots because at even in the

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,150
political level they make some sort of

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:12,220
brouhaha you know they sit around for

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,929
Upton you know you can see a bunch of

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,020
Republicans and Democrats up in Congress

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,179
going off from frolf catching about this

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,130
in order to appeal to their constituents

00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:30,190
who are concerned about it and then they

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:32,020
do diddly squat so that the ideal sort

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:36,520
of legislation I would like to see is

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:40,690
some sort of ideally a constitutionally

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,610
protected human right but this is a

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,770
little bit tricky and I don't know

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,799
exactly how it could work out entirely

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,450
because I'm only one man i'm not you

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:54,120
know the most gifted person in the world

00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,530
but some sort of law that would grant

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,120
individuals ownership and control over

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,570
their personal information something

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,340
like we've all clipped doll euless right

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,950
is there anybody here who is never

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:11,370
clicked on you look is there anybody in

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,370
here is ever read one liars

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:21,559
but uh something where the eula is not

00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,239
just a contractor you have to do this

00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,639
and we can do this and this and this and

00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:27,829
this and this it isn't this but

00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:30,379
something like okay facebook I'm

00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:33,169
providing here with a certain amount of

00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:35,690
public data you're contractually bound

00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:40,039
to do only these sorts of things with

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,719
this data and you know go from there the

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,549
issue is and we'll get into that a

00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:48,589
minute who actually owns that data and

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,619
that's a blurry area even if you say you

00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:55,339
won't hear home because we have people

00:18:51,619 --> 00:19:02,389
who you know info about me might also

00:18:55,339 --> 00:19:03,619
say something about y'all so I don't see

00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:05,389
this happening at least from the

00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,339
political level because like I wrote

00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:09,619
here you've got combined forces of

00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:14,899
businesses you've got political interest

00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:17,029
you've got to entrenched you know gaming

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:19,489
the spy business if that's what you want

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:24,709
to call it and they're not going to be

00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:27,589
yet you know they're not every

00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:29,959
government program or activity or

00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:32,329
something has people that benefit from

00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:36,289
it and they will fight tooth and nail

00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:41,599
front for it and this is a pretty large

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:44,899
seg arge segment of things and there are

00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:48,079
a lot of interested people who want to

00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:50,149
keep things the way they are and will do

00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,450
you know pretty much whatever it takes

00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:56,629
to to see that happen there aren't that

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,389
many powerful people who are all that

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:03,679
interested in sharing power or giving

00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:05,149
any of it up so you know I don't see

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,789
anything other than a concerted

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:09,529
grassroots and unfortunately do the way

00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,299
that the American people sort of roll

00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:13,700
over for things I don't see that

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,859
happening either so we're pretty much

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,539
left with individual solutions which

00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:22,159
fortunately things are a little bit

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:23,710
better here there's no great panacea at

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,450
this level

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:32,420
you can have a very secure digital

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:36,590
persona I suppose you would say if you

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,810
never get online you know if you cut

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:42,080
yourself off and even then it's not a

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,480
hundred percent but you know you can

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,110
have some control over this simply

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,060
because of you know if you can control

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,550
yourself and that's that's the hardest

00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:58,970
part especially for us Americans control

00:20:52,550 --> 00:21:03,620
ourselves oh that sounds communist you

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,820
know that's anti-american but uh since

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,420
we don't have control over information

00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,060
others acquire about us we do have

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:17,750
control over what personal information

00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:18,830
hasn't yet been divulged so this is sort

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,620
of while I was talking about in the gray

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,260
area something about me you might tell

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,710
something about you and I'll get that at

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,320
the moment each one of us as individuals

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,740
we have to decide how important our

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,980
privacy is and how far were willing to

00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,720
take it so I take it to a certain level

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,910
and there are people who take it further

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,440
than me and there are a lot of people

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:48,650
who don't take it nearly as far as I do

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,000
and I tend to look down on people who

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,730
don't take it at least as far as I do

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,870
but I don't really have a right to

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,670
provided that they have looked at this

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,150
intelligently thought about this

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,880
rationally said this is as far as I'm

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,400
willing to go I like this convenience i

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,110
like these services i like you know this

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,300
that other and i'm not willing to give

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,190
that up i'm willing to trade some of my

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,850
personal information some of my privacy

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,650
i'm going to be a little bit more less

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,320
anonymous a little bit more open with my

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,820
life in exchange for certain things and

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,280
as long as they've made that rational

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,210
choice i don't really have the right to

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,210
tell them that they

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,980
have chosen wrong I guess because what's

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:37,010
right for them might not be right for me

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:39,550
and vice versa so what can we do against

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:43,820
the data mongers these are you know

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:46,280
Facebook Google law of law and I'm

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,530
running a lot faster than I want to say

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,260
if anybody wants to slow me down you

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:55,880
raise your hand and ask a question but

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:59,030
uh abstinence I'm going to sound like a

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,950
Talib a pistear abstinence is one

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:04,160
hundred percent most effective solution

00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:06,680
is willing to commit to it we have the

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,570
same problem with abstinence online that

00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,280
we have with teenage sex it does not

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,900
work because people are not willing to

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:17,480
do it you know you can easily say if you

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,950
cut yourself completely off you don't

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,430
have anything to worry about I suppose

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,070
at least to some extent that's true but

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:26,780
then you're cut off from everything and

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,740
that's not necessarily the best thing to

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,930
do either Oh for pity's sake at least

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,180
when you see one of those stay logged in

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,600
buttons anywhere you are uncheck that

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,580
during thing you know ditch those

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,250
cookies don't stay logged into the sites

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,460
don't you know have that flying around

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,890
sending data everywhere you know that's

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:54,070
the very least you can do is to type

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,070
your password in every so often come on

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,720
while total apps and it's ain't really

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,580
acceptable partial abstinence is a

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,090
little bit more palatable I think I got

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:09,470
a little bit more hair on social media

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:12,680
this is a perhaps the second greatest

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:16,370
spy tool in the world I'll get the first

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:20,300
towards the end of the slide or into the

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,920
presentation but social media you either

00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,630
have to get off of it or you have to be

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,910
extremely strict and even when you're

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:30,830
extremely strict about what you put up

00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:35,150
there it's not perfect let's give an

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,140
example of a married man who's having an

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,029
affair

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,860
you can throw your you know bowl

00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,409
judgments or whatever just just put that

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,480
to the side for a moment I think we can

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,840
all agree who has invested interest in

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,240
keeping his wife from knowing about that

00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,000
so let's say he you know goes into his

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,690
oh honey I've got a business trip this

00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,390
weekend we're flying up to you know la

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,909
is something we've got a bunch going on

00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,890
and I'm going to be you know I'm going

00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:08,799
to be busy all weekend love you kiss on

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,510
the cheek by and he goes out to drives

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,039
to the airport and he meets his mistress

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,260
there and they go to myrtle beach and

00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:18,730
they spend you know the whole weekend

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:21,100
there and she takes some pictures of

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:26,710
them you know on the beach you know

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:29,830
laughing having fun and post them on

00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,529
facebook and someone comes along and

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,200
tags the husband's name on that picture

00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:37,270
and then you know a week later his wife

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,600
goes online and oh hey here's something

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,360
on your wall now he did not put any of

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,520
that information up there someone else

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,250
put that information about him up there

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,559
and since he had email account they were

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,809
able to tag it to that account she was

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,320
friend she you know got to see these

00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:58,149
things and you know through him not even

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,580
taking any action other than you know

00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:02,980
having an affair his wife was able to

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,679
find out about it through facebook even

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,440
though he may not have even logged into

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:14,559
it for years so you can see why even you

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,990
even if we have an account we're not and

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,590
we're not putting information about us

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:26,070
up there it's easy for other people to

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,070
put information about us there yes sir

00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:32,620
justice fire and someone spiked up a

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:37,190
friend by recognizing

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:38,780
okay so the question is you're in a

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,630
public space what's the difference

00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,670
between that somebody's friend of a

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,300
friend coming by recognizing him and

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,000
telling us why that's a good question

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,920
the the fact that you're in a public

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,720
space you know it's probably a bad thing

00:26:51,920 --> 00:27:02,510
let's say she took some pictures of them

00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:04,490
in their motel room get it all okay so

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:10,460
the question was who would folks post

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:17,870
that to facebook the answer is not

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:19,700
something I'm at liberty to share I mean

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,160
this is about digital privacy i will

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,910
have to you know this is going on

00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:30,410
youtube with my name attached to it

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,990
there are some things i will not say but

00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:36,080
uh so you know see even with a strict

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,800
discipline I it's not a hundred percent

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,840
effective what does it one thing i do

00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,670
things working out is that somebody

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,000
doesn't even necessarily have to decide

00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,530
on their own to tag that person every

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,050
person who sees them is going to be

00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,780
begged by facebook hey do you want to

00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:57,080
tag jokic last name yeah that's a good

00:27:53,780 --> 00:28:00,400
point out his comment you're a good man

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:04,580
I don't care what others say about you

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,620
so his comment was a that you know they

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,780
put this thing up there and they don't

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,690
even necessarily have to tag it but

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,420
Facebook is going to pester everyone who

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:18,560
looks at that to tag the people in there

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,970
yes going down the facebook rabbit hole

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,160
if you ever have read their user

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,130
agreement you don't own your pictures

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,170
anymore when you put them on facebook so

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,330
the dirty mistress pictures could get

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:30,800
posted on facebook facebook now owns

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,170
that picture and can make the dirty

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,900
mistress Myrtle Beach bikini calendar

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,020
own it sell it and never inform her of

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,020
that

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:55,050
so I think the question is where can i

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:56,250
obtain this calendar oh I'm assuming

00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,180
since you had the mic we got that

00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:04,290
question good okay anybody else want to

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:07,160
say something back in joke all ok one

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,160
more point move all

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,340
facebook

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,619
okay so I'm not sure how much of that we

00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:47,679
got but he was making a statement where

00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:51,549
I going further down the facebook rabbit

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,469
hole here you've got an issue of there's

00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:55,599
some sort of intent involved here and

00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:58,509
you know taking the cheating spouse

00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,789
metaphor you know a little bit further

00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:04,119
is that he could be unintentionally

00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:06,219
ratted out by a friend who doesn't even

00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,289
necessarily know this is going on and

00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:11,710
this that another doesn't have to be a

00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:14,580
malicious thing one one last one then

00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,580
we'll move on the next slide

00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:26,009
while you're here

00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,509
the person to give the person getting a

00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:32,509
bitter

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,460
here only winter day

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:45,299
where

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,299
by the different presentations

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:56,650
y'all get that a question good okay Oh

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:58,780
what he said basically we say is is he

00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:02,440
attended to talk someone else was giving

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,880
a presentation about how I guess the way

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,970
I should put it is we have different

00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,980
faces you know you are a different

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,110
person to your mom than you are to your

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,610
grandmama you're a different person to

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,620
those two than you are to your best

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,480
friend you're a different person do

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:21,100
those three then you order your balls

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:23,890
and that we sort of I guess behave

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,230
differently somewhat based on the

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,720
situation or based on the relationships

00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:31,330
we have to other people and that social

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,810
media kind of tears all that away

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,960
because any time we post something with

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,930
our friend you know it can be in one

00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,880
context where you know where we're

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:47,160
goofing around having a good time and

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:51,490
we're being sarcastic or something and

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,680
it goes out to everyone that way but it

00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,760
isn't read that way by everyone because

00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,380
everyone else you know your

00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,270
grandmother's relationship it's

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,780
fundamentally different from that of

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,930
your friends and yet she's receiving

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,230
this data as if she was the friend you

00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:11,100
originally had it with and there's a lot

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,880
of I wouldn't necessarily say

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,770
miscommunication because it was never

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,330
really intended to be communicated that

00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:21,810
way to begin with but there's a lot of

00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,520
misunderstanding i guess at best so a

00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,320
little bit further I really do

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,990
appreciate the good questions and

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,040
comments though because that's all what

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,040
we're going to make it ten o'clock

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:37,230
so against service providers thank God

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,590
we don't have to cut ourselves

00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,150
completely off you know ISPs things like

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:47,190
that we don't have to cut ourselves off

00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:48,870
completely if we did you would never be

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,590
able to see this YouTube presentation

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:56,460
when you know it's often it's enough to

00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:59,580
just limit used to a certain areas you

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,770
know example we got a an email account

00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:06,030
you only use for spam you know we've got

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:09,870
our gmail account for you know a pic

00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:12,420
spam @ gmail.com and you sign up for

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,850
every little thing that you don't ever

00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,490
want to get an email from and it goes

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:22,590
there to die it's sort of the email bit

00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:26,820
bucket and yes it tells a certain amount

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:29,100
about you but it isn't tied to your

00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,100
Facebook account you used a different

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,690
email address there it isn't tied to the

00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,060
rest of the stuff you do on Google use

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:40,220
different accounts there for Google+

00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:45,810
does anybody here actually use Google+

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:49,220
bunch of liars you might have an account

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,220
you don't use it

00:33:51,870 --> 00:34:02,220
spam oh yeah yeah but uh you know you

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:06,030
can you can sort of partition things up

00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:09,750
and each each service provider whether

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:12,780
it's social media whether it's a online

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:16,350
email account whether it's an online web

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,659
service something like leno is a service

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,639
provider we don't necessarily think of

00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,470
it that way but lee nodes and service

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,190
provider they're offering you a service

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:28,830
of a virtual machine or a container or

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,740
some kind it's been some time since I've

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:36,929
looked at linode so I wouldn't know but

00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:38,940
uh I don't know specifics but because

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,050
you can partition things out and you can

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:47,129
select what each one sees at least then

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:51,139
you have you know it's easy to still use

00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:54,179
these things and no one really has a

00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,679
clear complete picture you can almost

00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,910
treat them like a business relationship

00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:04,910
in some ways I do all these things here

00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:04,910
and that's it yes sir

00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:26,910
so his comment was let's say even when

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,130
likely know who has your best interest

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,810
at heart let's say they actually do I

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,330
don't know I don't know the good people

00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:41,130
at Leno I'm sure they're excellent their

00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:42,900
spots are right so you know even if you

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,360
trust them and you trust your ISP you've

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,220
got all these other ISPs that are in the

00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,740
way that are you know connected between

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,840
you you've got level three carriers and

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,670
blow above the law and they don't

00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,980
necessarily have your best interest to

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,210
heart I will take this a little bit

00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,520
further and say you're dealing with a

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:05,990
business entity which may come and go

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,460
and even if it stays forever is

00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,650
certainly going to change management and

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,040
probably is going to change hands at

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:16,710
some point in the future so if they have

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,090
your best interest at heart today there

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,120
ain't no guarantee they're going to have

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,490
your best interest at heart tomorrow or

00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:29,120
the year after that you know things

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:29,120
change over time but data is permanent

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:40,470
bye okay thanks sounds a great comment

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:45,300
oh and I'm assuming that specific tool

00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:47,640
endowed okay well you're talking about

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,650
you know data retention guidelines where

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:53,340
you know you they only keep data for 60

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,590
days 90 days whatever yes ma'am I guess

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,200
within that 60 days is when all the

00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:07,650
identity theft occurs for people's bank

00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:11,160
accounts yeah and it's a difficult thing

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,500
to say I mean we we also go to the big

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,480
identity theft sort of things where you

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,550
know target gets attacked and there's

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,140
you know half a million or several

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,930
million credit cards that are being

00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:25,770
compromised and but the majority of the

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,890
time when we find that there's a major

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:31,040
identity theft thing it's somebody took

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,290
a work laptop home and it went missing

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,770
you know it was even lost or stolen or

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,660
something and then you suddenly see you

00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,030
know millions of letters being sent out

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,280
saying you know some of this stuff may

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,920
have been misplaced and we're offering

00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,410
you free identity theft protection for a

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,300
year for ten dollars a month normally

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,400
but we're going to waive that cover it

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,780
for you it's generally those sort of

00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,290
situations more than then you know like

00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,270
being hacked or something deliberately

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,340
and in that sort of situation it's hard

00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:09,210
to imagine just how long the data

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:13,260
retention is because if that laptop is

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:17,400
taken home today and it has 90 days

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:22,280
worth of data on it let's say and it

00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:26,850
ain't college my car and we're good now

00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:30,510
and it ain't power back on and it gets

00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:33,570
lost or stolen you know it can be you

00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:37,590
know 23 years or even be six months

00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:40,530
later that someone pulls the drive grabs

00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:42,330
all the data off of it and

00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,190
you know your data retention policy

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,430
doesn't matter there because that data

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:50,610
exists somewhere and it can be stolen

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:54,680
during that window or without or outside

00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:54,680
that window depending on you know how

00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:02,100
meticulous I guess you would say data

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:05,460
collectors are about handling that and

00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,280
for the most part they I mean I don't

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,780
have a lot of great experience on this

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,460
but based on what I've seen they're not

00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,490
very meticulous about following those

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:21,330
things other business or the interest

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:31,590
get in the way so anything up yes miss

00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:33,420
dad like ad blocker or no script or I

00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,340
don't know if you saw the thing where

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,130
you could opt out of the advertiser

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,840
stuff with the digital advertising

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,670
Alliance so I don't have you looked in

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:46,850
any of those or would you recommend any

00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,850
of that kind of stuff links is awesome

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:55,380
in all seriousness ghostery and this is

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,720
made by one of the companies that sends

00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,240
out ads and collects data so you know in

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,760
the future it might you know not be as

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,220
effective as it is today it's pretty

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,030
awesome stuff it will block more things

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:11,370
than whatever else you have adblock plus

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:13,110
yeah I bought plus and gostrey will make

00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,090
your web browsing experience a hell of a

00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,980
lot better yes sir

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:24,829
more just drop that massage so I'll

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:29,140
disconnect at me and equitable boy that

00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,140
supervise Western they could get

00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,930
so it's called disconnect me it's

00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,060
similar to some of these other things

00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,320
but it's an ex-googler near and a

00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,180
privacy rights attorney got together and

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,210
built this plug-in for your browser and

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,220
it just it sort of tracks all the things

00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,540
that is blocking for you and tells you

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,820
all these social media things all these

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,160
tracking links and click backs that just

00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,770
don't keep track of you anymore the

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,810
blossom so it's pretty good plugin well

00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:57,200
thanks i wasn't aware of disconnect up

00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:58,880
me oh i'll check that out since i don't

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,490
actually know about it i'm not going to

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,440
give them a plug right now but something

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,609
for your further anta fication figure it

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,290
out and when you get right down to it we

00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:12,020
all have to figure it out as individuals

00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,970
I mean there we've already gone over to

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:18,109
the idea that the group discussion stuff

00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:19,670
isn't great so or the group action stuff

00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,800
is somewhat limited and what can be

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,410
accomplished due to a lack of people who

00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,830
are actually interested so those of us

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,140
who understand the risk who care about

00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:34,369
this sort of stuff we all have to sort

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:36,560
of figure it out ourselves so let's just

00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:39,410
move on long cuz let's see what time is

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,510
it ooh we're getting close against the

00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,490
middleman these are your ISPs but not

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:49,880
just ISPs think about your wireless

00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:52,160
carrier think about a your satellite or

00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,660
cable TV provider you know these people

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,230
are providing a service and they have a

00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,060
certain amount on you your ISP your

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,040
wireless provider obviously they have

00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,780
the most but there are a lot of other

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,780
sort of providers you can think of

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:15,740
encryption works and i'll get more to

00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:17,570
this a little bit later on if you want

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,770
to be a hundred percent uh nonnamous

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,380
you'd have to use something like tour

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,170
but against the middleman we really

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:28,130
don't care that much they pretty much

00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:32,270
know when they see gigs of traffic going

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:35,380
by 8pm that you're watching netflix you

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:37,900
know they know that they

00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,970
you are you really that worried that

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,980
they know that you're going to Google or

00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,440
Facebook but don't know what you're

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,210
putting up because it's an HTTPS

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,039
connection you know those are the things

00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,119
you have to decide for yourself I would

00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:54,069
say I wouldn't worry that much about it

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:57,640
because that information I guess you

00:42:54,069 --> 00:43:01,509
would say that meta data there's a good

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,779
buzz word you know not that important

00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:07,390
but I think we can all agree that there

00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,920
might be times than it is if you really

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,349
worried about it you can go with some

00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,319
sort of full encryption service liked or

00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:16,180
some sort of VPN something we're even

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,599
you know the IPS who you're

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,890
communicating wit gets encrypted you can

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,630
do that but yes probably not needed as

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,940
long as you're using some sort of in

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:32,289
point the endpoint encryption you know

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:35,069
you're okay so against the intelligence

00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:38,920
services how do we you know foil the NSA

00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:40,839
once again encryption works the Snowden

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,990
revelations show us time and time again

00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:46,809
but good solid non encryption algorithms

00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,759
using decent keys are incredibly

00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:50,920
difficult from the NSA to hide the

00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:53,079
greatest revelation is that the NSA

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,240
doesn't have some sort of magic quantum

00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,880
computer that breaks everything all at

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,890
once I think we can all breathe a sigh

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:07,150
of relief there but if you look at how

00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:09,099
they do things like a here's a good

00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,660
example the FBI when they went in and

00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:14,910
shut down the Silk Road everybody know

00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,910
what the silk road is stoner

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,559
when they went in and sat down like the

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,150
Silk Road they shut down a bunch of

00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,520
child pornography sites they were on

00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:30,020
these dark nets or whatever you want to

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,319
call inside of the Tor network they went

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,180
in and they put in or they took over

00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,329
these sites and they put in some exploit

00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:41,770
code that exploited the tor browser

00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:44,829
which was based on some ancient Firefox

00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:47,329
thing with tor built into it and

00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:51,740
exploited a vulnerability in that

00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:53,960
browser so they got to the content after

00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:56,569
it was decrypted and before it was

00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,500
encrypted in the first place on on your

00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:02,000
browser's end and they did that because

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,700
they couldn't really break the

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,480
encryption if they could it would take a

00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:10,369
massive amount of work to do it once

00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,859
whereas it's a heck of a lot easier to

00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:15,460
attack the small vulnerability exploit

00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:18,380
it everywhere and get everything

00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:23,569
unencrypted do we have a comment over

00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:28,279
here okay nevermind so if you if you

00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:30,559
want to you know deal with intelligent

00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:32,000
services encryption works and maintain

00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,390
your patches because that's where they

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,250
attack they don't really try and break

00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:41,359
your encryption they try to break your

00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:43,010
box again the Snowden revelations show

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,980
this time and time and time and time

00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:49,430
again they have lists of exploits they

00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,640
categorize them based on you know how

00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:56,029
effective they are how well-known they

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,440
are and you know they make logical

00:45:56,029 --> 00:46:00,250
choices as to which one we're going to

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:06,410
use to attack this person based on their

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:09,020
perceived threat level you know the data

00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:11,990
they might could get and you know

00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:14,779
various things and as long as you

00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,170
maintain patches it's not perfect

00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:19,670
because they can have zero day stuff and

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,740
we're certain they have zero day stuff

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,620
that we don't know about yet and if they

00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:26,740
don't they'll find some other

00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,950
if the NSA doesn't then you know Chinese

00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:33,280
secret service wheel if I ask will have

00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:35,290
my six-wheeled Mossad will Brazilian

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,710
Secret Service whoever they are they're

00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:42,220
so secret we don't know you know they'll

00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:44,650
find it Mexico's drug cartels will find

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,900
it that's the secret service in Mexico

00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:52,270
in fact I think that's the only service

00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:54,190
in Mexico and you know reduce exposure

00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,430
as much as possible these these are

00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,560
basic things firewalls you know do you

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,320
do your basic security conscious stuff

00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:06,040
that you see everyone tell you to do and

00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:09,220
that we're all fairly light song do

00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,800
those things and you're really if not

00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,960
completely avoiding your drum your

00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:18,280
dramatically reducing your risk you're

00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:21,040
mitigating the the problems you know but

00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,130
basically beating these people revolves

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,920
down to using good sense you know

00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,500
encrypt what you actually encrypt

00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,120
everything you possibly can because the

00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,370
last thing they want to see is you know

00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,320
she's going to Facebook and posting up

00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:39,460
you know all these pictures of her

00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:41,500
little doggy toto and suddenly you know

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,380
she's making some encrypted connection

00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:49,920
out to Iran we're interested in this

00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:53,370
lady you know what's in these bids and

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,370
you know if you encrypt everything then

00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:59,230
there's no reason to look at this sort

00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:02,170
of data it's more suspicious than that

00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:06,160
sort of data and the more of us encrypt

00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:08,350
everything the fewer keys they have to

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,680
go on and my keys I don't mean

00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:13,630
encryption keys I mean tales like this

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,240
guy's encrypting something he's

00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:19,120
suspicious you know that's sort of the

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,340
way it goes and I'm sure they have

00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,020
things like oh we're connecting to

00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,570
google we're connecting to Facebook and

00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:27,700
it's an HTTPS session we're not

00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,160
interested in that we're interested in

00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,930
all the other HTTPS sessions to the

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,930
places that we don't know about and

00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,330
those

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,980
I'm sure we all make lots of those we

00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:43,460
don't just go to Facebook Google our

00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,440
bank you know we don't just go to Amazon

00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,200
we might go to some little small store

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,599
here and there and you know that's sort

00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,220
of a cube this is a suspicious behavior

00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:54,470
they're encrypting something and it's

00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:58,790
not going to facebook you know what

00:48:54,470 --> 00:49:01,400
could they be doing that's suspicious so

00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:04,700
and I can't really read my last one can

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:08,290
scrolled off on a laptop always stay

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:11,660
vigilant that's the most important part

00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:15,950
we you know we have a tendency to get

00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:18,560
lackadaisical or to get complacent with

00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:20,690
sort of things and I'm just as guilty as

00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,900
the next person this is why these

00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,570
tactics work so well people don't packs

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,380
their machines is there anybody other me

00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:39,200
still running windows XP I love windows

00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:46,190
XP now it's finally stable they quit

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:47,330
messing with it so but but you have to

00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,740
be vigilant about keeping all your

00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:51,440
patches keep keeping everything

00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:54,170
maintained about not doing stupid stuff

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,180
because it's convenient and easy you

00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:00,170
know if you maintain that vigilance if

00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:05,510
you take it seriously then you can you

00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:06,710
know greatly reduce your exposure so one

00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,010
of the last things we want to talk about

00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:13,730
is the world's greatest spy device it's

00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:15,200
this little junker right here and every

00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:21,310
one of us carries one who does not have

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:26,320
a smartphone in here one two three four

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:26,320
five five

00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:36,859
good man I I don't know whether to be

00:50:35,509 --> 00:50:39,619
three older or whether to be

00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:43,339
disappointed or if they're just lying to

00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:45,559
me but you know how many people don't

00:50:43,339 --> 00:50:48,680
have smart phones these days how many

00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:53,829
kids have a smart phone these days you

00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:57,529
know at 14 15 they get smart phones and

00:50:53,829 --> 00:51:00,019
they carried their entire lives on these

00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:01,970
devices not just phone calls not just a

00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:03,799
real-time GPS coordinates not just their

00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,660
tax their email the pictures the videos

00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:08,539
they're browsing history their social

00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:12,049
media all their apps that they use their

00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:15,619
snapchat stuff you know all in one

00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:18,470
convenient easy to carry package that

00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:21,500
can be high that can be swiped it can be

00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:24,200
you know taken by the police and every

00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,329
bit of content downloaded on hang handed

00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,549
back then they browse through that stuff

00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:30,799
as it goes there's actually a Supreme

00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:35,000
Court decision that were you either

00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:38,180
pending or you got to come in that we

00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,130
were either pending from one or it might

00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:42,829
have come down and I haven't noticed yet

00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:46,009
about that specific practice you get

00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:48,589
stopped for a traffic violation your tag

00:51:46,009 --> 00:51:51,289
is out of date the police come give me

00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:53,779
your smartphone stick a thing in there

00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:56,269
download all the data off of it for your

00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:59,240
entire life's history hand it back to

00:51:56,269 --> 00:52:01,880
you they store that data indefinitely no

00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,589
warrant they can stick in a database

00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,700
search through it as much as they want

00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:09,230
to know Warren and this is you know what

00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,750
the attorney general's office in the

00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:17,000
United States is arguing this is the way

00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:20,420
it should be and what one of the

00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,539
greatest or I suppose most depressing

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,730
points about those arguments the Supreme

00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:27,559
Court had I forget which justice it was

00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:31,609
it wasn't Roberts but it might as well

00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:33,920
have been said I don't have a smartphone

00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:35,190
I can't figure out how to unlock the

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,109
dang thing

00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:42,550
this is the guy making a decision about

00:52:38,109 --> 00:52:46,809
how to use it or about you know should

00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:50,920
this be susceptible to instant I'm

00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:54,190
sorry what you go have to speak up I

00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,470
can't hear ya it might be and I ain't

00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:59,020
got no why do I can't remember it wasn't

00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:06,430
Sotomayor and it wasn't Kagan it wasn't

00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:10,150
robbers so that leaves you six that

00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:14,380
leaves you five house was too busy

00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:17,200
looking at pictures on this whose

00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:21,460
pictures was he looking at that's the

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,740
question but it's generally difficult to

00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:28,960
all of these things and not give away

00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:31,510
personal information i mean the the real

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,660
insidious nature of it it's just how

00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:36,250
damn convenient it is it's right here in

00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,160
your pocket it's right here on your own

00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:42,190
in your purse or on your belt and you

00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:46,690
know any information is right there at

00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:48,730
the touch of your fingertips yes snakes

00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,859
are unable to close their eyes to sleep

00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:56,010
or dolphins keep one eye open while I

00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:56,010
sleep manatee tastes wonderful

00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:04,750
you know these are all yeah it's right

00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:10,660
there the touch of your fingertips all

00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:12,640
your email uh the the married man having

00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:16,600
an affair with his you know on his wife

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,770
and you know his girlfriend sex him some

00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,270
stuff right there on the phone you know

00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:25,540
world's greatest spy device what do we

00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:28,600
do about this I don't know who would

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:31,570
ever do this but I would bow down and

00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,920
kiss the feet of any manufacturer that

00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:36,490
came out with something like a

00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,800
smartphone with a hardware switch that

00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:41,170
disconnected the power to the GPS device

00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,090
you know like on the side of your iPhone

00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:44,530
you've got a switch that automatically

00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:47,350
turns off the ringer you know it's

00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:50,830
hardware switch cook it's off you can't

00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:52,540
turn it on by software why not have

00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:54,640
something like that or like the laptop

00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,530
switches you often have the hardware

00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:07,030
laptop switches that disable your

00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:11,860
wireless on something like this no yeah

00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:16,450
even if you turn off the gps the cell

00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:20,380
towers at least your general area okay

00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:22,780
his point was a even if you turn off the

00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,630
gps thanks to the cell towers your

00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:29,380
general location is known to that I say

00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:32,290
there's only one cell tower Riley if so

00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:33,970
they only know in a pretty wide radiance

00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:38,050
around that thing that someone's there

00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:45,460
and once you leave there it's a long

00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:49,660
time before you pick up another one yeah

00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:51,550
pull the SIM card that that's not quite

00:55:49,660 --> 00:56:01,300
as much fun as throwing into there and

00:55:51,550 --> 00:56:03,040
shoot it with a shotgun anybody else got

00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,720
a comment we're pretty much at you know

00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,790
the end here i want questions and

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,470
comments this is meant to foster a

00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:11,080
public debate this is meant to foster

00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:13,090
Thal this is meant to get everyone

00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:16,560
thinking about these things and talking

00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,560
about them yes sir

00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:30,230
grandmother fall

00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:34,119
collect information keep it

00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:34,119
and as fight

00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,130
so

00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:46,180
that's a wonderful comment and I wish I

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,640
had thought about that that for this

00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,290
thing he said you know I've only focused

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,200
on soar like the digital stuff but

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:55,930
there's also the grandfather of all this

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,420
the credit bureaus who collect all this

00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:00,610
data about us and keep it and they own

00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,350
the data and not us and it doesn't

00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:05,260
matter that it's about us we don't have

00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:07,870
to say so in what it actually is and if

00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,880
the data is incorrect and they have it

00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:12,310
they still maintain that it's correct

00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:15,640
and the arbiters of that are the same

00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:19,180
people who had the data so if you prove

00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,820
it's incorrect getting it changed is you

00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:24,070
know an act of Congress and you know

00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:32,590
that's that's a valid point that's

00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:38,680
something we should consider well they

00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:42,470
may drop just like you ever buy

00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,710
credit card draw back the black one

00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:48,790
that's a good point the credit card

00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:51,830
Bureau is also having a financial or

00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:54,410
behavioral algorithm so you know you buy

00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:56,300
alcohol with a credit card your flag is

00:57:54,410 --> 00:58:01,430
a little bit more of a risk and someone

00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:06,130
who uses cash that really wasn't a

00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:06,130
problem for me until I turned 21

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:20,589
liar that's a nice first credit card

00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:24,329
that's what I mean I used cash before

00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:24,329
the end yes sir

00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:51,290
okay so he was a wonderful so his

00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:55,210
comment was you know like specific to

00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:58,040
facebook we're saying we have these uh

00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:00,530
controls I guess for who can and can't

00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,090
tag you so you can say only these few

00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,730
people can tag me and then when someone

00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:08,260
else tries to it it sends an email to

00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:11,510
you and that's not like a great solution

00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:14,290
but that solution can be changed

00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:17,270
tomorrow nothing stops facebook from

00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:21,890
doing that specifically yes sir you

00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:24,290
think about that talk about facebook

00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:26,570
when I talked about Facebook begging you

00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,040
to tag people in their pictures the

00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,840
sinister thing to me is they're using

00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,540
facial recognition software they already

00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,060
know who it is when my friend's wife

00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,980
Christie posts pictures of her family

00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:38,780
she never tags her husband and every

00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,090
time I see one of her pictures it asked

00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:43,310
me do you want to tag Kyle and I'm like

00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:47,330
well if his wife didn't why do I but the

00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:48,800
point is facebook already knows if they

00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,630
wanted to tomorrow they can just start

00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,580
automatically attacking it that's a fair

00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:55,340
point I'm afraid this is all the time

00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:57,020
we've got for this discussion so if you

00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:01,930
want to talk some more you can find me

00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,930
later I'll bring you know alcohol

01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,840
your customers rely on your website or

01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:52,210
application if it's slower

01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,180
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:56,980
and costs you money keeping your

01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:00,490
business critical systems humming along

01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:03,310
requires insight into what they're doing

01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,320
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:07,570
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,880
resource limitations and other problems

01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,650
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,260
your systems performance metrics in

01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:17,110
real-time and record this data for later

01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:19,090
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:21,100
see what's really going on under the

01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:23,230
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,210
visualize the status of all your systems

01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:27,970
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:31,090
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:33,550
memory swap processes load and network

01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:36,130
usage click a specific system to access

01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:38,110
its individual dashboard then click and

01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:41,110
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:43,119
more detail comprehensive network data

01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:45,820
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,380
is available on the network tab and disk

01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:49,300
rights and free space on the disk

01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:52,150
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,670
displays usage statistics for individual

01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:56,860
processes the system info tab shows

01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:59,080
listening services active connections

01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:01,240
and available updates adding long view

01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,920
to a system is easy just click the

01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,080
button copy the one line installation

01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,510
command then run the command on your

01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,220
linux system to complete the process the

01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:11,410
agent will begin collecting data and

01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,250
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:15,800
start rolling

01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:18,170
use longview to gain visibility into

01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:21,910
your servers so when your website or app

01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,910
