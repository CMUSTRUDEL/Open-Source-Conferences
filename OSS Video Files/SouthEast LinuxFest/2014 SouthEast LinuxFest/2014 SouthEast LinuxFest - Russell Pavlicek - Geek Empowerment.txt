videos pasa this is the geek empowerment

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,920
talk and start with the obligatory who

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,360
the heck is the geek up front basically

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,480
I've been around the block for a long

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,510
time been using Linux since 95 became my

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,760
desktop system in 97 how many people

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,680
remember fvw m95 yeah one of those good

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,699
things that you kind of hope it's tucked

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,860
away and say one of those brain cells

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,850
that dies as you get older you know but

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,920
I used to give a lot of talks about open

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,739
source advocacy in the early days back

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,390
in the late 90s the early aughts we have

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:12,930
a real good name for that decade I mean

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:16,619
what I then went on to you know to work

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,270
as a columnist and worked on the Linux

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,509
show webcast how many people remember

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:27,270
the Linux show god I feel a little oh

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:30,240
and I wrote a book which was on slashdot

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,009
and all the copies that were ever sold

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,049
were sold within four days and then

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,220
everyone forgot about the book which is

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:41,369
about usual and currently I'm evangelist

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,759
for Zen project and I've got a Zen talk

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,790
later on after lunch for those of you

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,990
who actually decided to hang around

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:53,759
thank you for coming out on a Sunday

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:56,280
morning this talk actually comes out of

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,950
some reflection and personal experience

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,960
so as I said I started off working

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,270
inside the open source world back in the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,649
90s I then like a lot of people ended up

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,039
working for a company that was consuming

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,720
open source but not producing it despite

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,980
the fact that we tried to get them to

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:21,180
some that then was consumed by a company

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,910
that was allergic open source so I spent

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,090
some time in the bowels of hell you know

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,490
and then just a year and a half ago I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,650
actually got to break free and get back

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,870
into the community as an open source

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,430
evangelist and when it when i did so i

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,860
noticed that certain things had changed

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,800
and that's basically where this talk has

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,650
come from so a little reflection you

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,480
know open source is driving the world

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,800
the internet breathes open source air if

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,540
you don't believe me just look at the

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,370
number of web servers are running Apache

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:58,730
look at the number of lamps tax out

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,870
there you know it is just stupendous I

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,480
think what a lot of people don't really

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,610
realize is that open source i think was

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,220
a great beneficiary of the whole y2k

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,480
nonsense how many people had to wrestle

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,010
with the y2k stuff on the job you know

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,440
one of the things that I remember so

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,140
distinctly I i live in the Washington DC

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,170
area so I've had a number of government

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,019
customers over the years and the amount

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,530
of money that was thrown at trying to

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,910
keep boat anchors from dying on january

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,380
first 2000 was absolutely astounding and

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,860
i can actually tell you some stories

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,480
that would curl your hair later but but

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,160
one of the interesting things that I saw

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,610
was that all the budget was going

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,570
towards the y2k stuff so you had this

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,860
new technology coming on the web that

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,570
everyone said yeah we got to do stuff

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,070
about that but there was no budget for

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,600
it because they were all trying to make

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,870
sure that the boat anchors wouldn't die

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,600
and so system administrators being the

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,239
resourceful lot that they are went out

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,330
and find you found useful software that

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,530
fit within the non-existent budget and

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:13,019
hence you saw open-source coming in

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,700
heavily on the web for corporations and

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,340
that was also part of that wonderful

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,750
time when the sysadmin at big company

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,250
who you had lunch with yesterday was

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,580
talking about all the Apache servers he

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:29,419
was running and then the seat

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:32,150
yo of big company was just quoted in

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,879
forbes as saying we will never use open

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,819
source in our organization there was

00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,759
that immense disconnect because what was

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,560
happening on the level of reality was

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,319
not being dictated from above it was

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,830
crawling up from below and so there was

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:52,039
this disconnect and that's the way we

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,810
really started if you think back to the

00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:56,150
1990s how many people were working in

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,580
the open source world sometime the 1990s

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,289
does show hands okay so this is history

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,129
for some of this might be new for others

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:07,090
it's important to know believe me we

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:10,699
were constantly ignored by analysts

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,979
where do analysts work they work on the

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,449
sea levels right there talking to the

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,069
CEOs they're trying to see what the big

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,710
picture is we're trying to see what's

00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:20,840
coming down the road well the sea levels

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,719
at that point as I just said we're being

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,020
disconnected from what the sysadmin czar

00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:28,370
doing and so this the sea levels are

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,779
saying oh yes we're going to be using

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,190
Microsoft we're going to be using this

00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,370
thing we're going to be using solaris

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,990
work and meanwhile the admins we're

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,250
pushing out miles and miles of lamps tax

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,379
because that's what they had to work

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:47,629
with in the press and in management

00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:50,960
levels you know open sources dismissed

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:53,839
as a hackers toy you know teenagers

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,629
working in their basements writing this

00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,330
software oh you know this is just this

00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,710
is not professional this is not what the

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,219
enterprise needs blah blah blah blah

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:08,029
blah it was almost a 100 percent

00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:09,710
voluntary effort back then which may be

00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:12,860
a little bit hard to believe right now

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,949
but it was true everything was running

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:22,520
on passion things were moving very

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:24,379
quickly and you know amongst us we knew

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,900
what was going on because we've come to

00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,060
little meetings like this on weekends

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,240
and so forth and talk to one another and

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,509
we could see it but at the top levels

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,909
management levels analysts levels no

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,789
visibility at all so it was a different

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:44,000
world back then

00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:47,270
today however we've got legitimacy you

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,159
know the trade media reports on us how

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,759
many articles you see in major magazines

00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:54,590
that talk about using open source stuff

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,719
sea level management still may not be

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,030
particularly clue full about what open

00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:00,800
source is or does but they get the idea

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,240
that they're going to use it for some

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,289
things and that it has some form of

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,319
value one of the repeated themes I'm

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:11,479
hearing recently is using open source as

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,080
a model for collaborative development

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,789
even in non open source areas so there

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,530
is this concept that there is something

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,740
of value going on here even by the

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,990
people who may not really understand it

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:28,729
how many people right now in this room

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,099
have a job where you write use or

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:32,509
otherwise employ open source as part of

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:36,500
the job description just show of hands

00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:38,719
please yeah that's that's about what I

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,150
figure and that's amazing compared to

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:44,120
where we were 15 years ago absolutely

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,349
amazing so we are in this area where

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:52,990
open source employment is not difficult

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:56,839
to find it's not unusual it's out there

00:07:52,990 --> 00:08:00,620
so all is good right we won we got the

00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:06,460
legitimacy we got the jobs we got

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,460
respect we got everything or did we

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:15,850
there is something that has changed and

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,920
one of the one of the lessons that I

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,690
suggest we are not talking about I'm not

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,930
hearing it discussed in the community

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,700
and that's why I'm giving this talk is

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,590
that the heart of open source we talk

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,500
about the results of open source to code

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,220
and that's wonderful because the code

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,230
empowers others it empowers the startup

00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,860
it empowers the mom-and-pop organization

00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,840
it empowers the teenager who wants to be

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,580
able to do things all these people are

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,360
being empowered third world countries

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:49,290
wonderful but there's a piece that we're

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:54,460
forgetting as well that the empowerment

00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:57,550
also happened to us and that the real

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:02,440
revolution I suggest with the coming of

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:05,650
open-source had to do with us changing

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,410
and then the way we changed then change

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:14,860
the way we dealt with others and what

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:16,390
our output was so we reinvented us when

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,400
we came along with the open-source

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,710
revolution by open-source I'm saying

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,240
free / open source I don't want to get

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,340
into the free software open source of

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,740
debate at this point but if you're in

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,760
that camp that's where I'm talking about

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,630
unfortunately the lesson of the

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,190
revolution in us is being forgotten and

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,720
this is especially true I suggest for

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,920
some of us who weren't around at the

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,090
beginning let's think back people with

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:51,160
gray hair in your temples think of IT

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:54,760
land circa nineteen eighty-five what was

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,990
life like if you were a techie you're a

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:03,250
geek you were a power tool you had

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,990
skills you had knowledge and you sit

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,230
down you shut up and you did what

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:12,520
someone else told you to do that was

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:15,220
life for the computer geek you really

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,800
didn't have much of a self will a self

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,200
determination there certainly wasn't

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,580
anyone listening to you you're lucky if

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,090
you get your boss to listen

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:28,510
let alone anyone else you have all this

00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:31,540
talent but yet you are being directed in

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,970
what you will do day after day moment by

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,310
moment you get some idea of some really

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,130
great feature for the software you're

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,700
working on you go to whomever say this

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:45,040
would be cool they say well that that

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,110
may be but it's not inside the work plan

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,440
so get back to work and do what we tell

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:55,660
you to do that really was part and

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:58,180
parcel of life for the for the geek 20

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,360
30 years ago you didn't have much

00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,300
respect even have much bargaining power

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,330
you didn't hear about people technical

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,770
people who had to bargain for a better

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,030
salary there wasn't anything to bargain

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:16,180
for you took what they gave you that was

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:21,310
pretty much it because you after all you

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:25,060
were just a geek but with open source

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,950
with the free software movement there

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,450
was a change that happened in our own

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:34,720
minds and it comes about and how many

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:39,550
people remember the Atlanta Linux

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,850
showcase anyone yes best brother al as

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,740
the first of the first free and

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,090
open-source event that I ever went to

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,870
was a 1997 Atlanta Linux showcase 500

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,030
geeks mostly the fat white male variety

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:59,170
meeting on a weekend in atlanta to talk

00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,390
about open source you know i think we

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,160
may have lost a little weight we've

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,819
added a few more women but not nearly

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,639
enough and

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:10,549
our ethnic diversity is good if you look

00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:13,249
at India and Asia but for somehow we're

00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:15,139
forgetting about people of color in this

00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:18,979
continent I don't know why that's

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:23,089
another problem but it was a

00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:25,039
get-together you know no one was there

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:28,369
being paid by their company they just

00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,929
wanted to go it was a cheap hotel I

00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:32,029
don't remember what the hotel was but

00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,499
the thing I remember about the hotel was

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,109
the most appropriate hotel in the world

00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:39,829
because it's restaurant was a Wendy's

00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:42,439
and this is for younger people this was

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,720
Wendy's before it started to suck you

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,970
know so I mean you had like all the fat

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,029
all the caffeine all the sugar all the

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,699
grease all the fuel that a geek needs

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:54,679
for cheap for a weekend to talk about

00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:57,410
code so I mean it was wonderfully

00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,029
appropriate and you would go and you

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,319
would talk at these you know talk to

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:07,369
people in sessions like this and you see

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:11,239
the fire in people's eyes the fire in

00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:14,359
the bellies people were excited it was

00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:17,779
amazing it truly was amazing and it

00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:20,529
wasn't some sort of amazement at some

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,779
new commercial collaborative engagement

00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,600
that wasn't it at all and it wasn't even

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,669
about the Four Freedoms now are the four

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,399
freedoms expect you know important

00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:33,470
absolutely absolutely they're important

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,720
but that's not what what people were

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,989
getting Ziggy de back they were using

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,369
the freedoms of free software but it was

00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:41,769
a little bit more than that and it

00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:44,449
certainly wasn't about employment

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:47,869
because if I had asked this question at

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:51,169
that session back then I would have been

00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:55,369
lucky to have seen a hand because no one

00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:58,789
no one was doing anything professionally

00:13:55,369 --> 00:14:00,139
an open source and those that were you

00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:02,239
know we're probably working with little

00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,259
mom-and-pop companies that you didn't

00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,329
know if you're going to have a job next

00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,459
month quite honestly that's pretty much

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:09,859
the way things work but what was coming

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,649
about was a self-realization and an

00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:15,189
empowerment that the technical world had

00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,189
never seen before

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,790
people realize that there was no one in

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:27,019
the room to say no and this was

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:29,089
different people had ideas we could talk

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:34,179
to each other we could say you know what

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:37,610
I want to do blah and for the first time

00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:40,490
you could go ahead and do it and you

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:45,050
survived or failed or crane to your own

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:49,459
merits you could just do it there wasn't

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:52,899
anyone to stop you just do it you

00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:56,449
weren't the power to love someone else

00:14:52,899 --> 00:15:00,050
you made decisions how many people know

00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:02,319
Dilbert first off good now how many

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,809
people remember more dak the preventer

00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:08,660
okay homework assignment before you

00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:11,899
leave the conference if you have using

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:15,199
usable Wi-Fi just Google moored acta

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:20,779
preventer okay this is important because

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,670
this is the old style mindset of IT more

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,360
dak was the guy who used to come around

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,800
and tell them that they couldn't have or

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,470
couldn't do the things that they need to

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,279
do to get their job done that was his

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,410
job paraphrasing a strip you know more

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,170
dad comes up to Dilbert and says those

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,559
servers you order they're not on the

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,809
approved list you can't have them and

00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:47,179
Dilbert said something like approve list

00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,370
what approve lift I've never seen an

00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,529
approved list you show me the approved

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,459
list I don't even think it exists and

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,829
more tax or sits back and says you know

00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:01,879
not really a list it's more a state of

00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:05,449
mind and that really was it it was that

00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,160
control thing that told you no no no no

00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:11,269
no you do what you do what we say and

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:14,679
that's all you do and suddenly that's

00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:18,470
turned on its head suddenly geeks are

00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:20,269
making decisions they're deciding for

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,639
themselves what's good and what's not

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,529
they're deciding for themselves what

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,139
designs make sense and what don't

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:28,040
they're experimenting they're trying

00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:33,780
things

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:36,630
and what's more this is where we sort of

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,990
found our voice individually and as a

00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:42,660
community and i remember miguel de Caza

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,250
how many people know who Miguel is how

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,140
many people know what the genome project

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:51,450
is ok long ago and far away Miguel was

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,200
the head of a little bitty project that

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,820
was just beginning called you know and

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,270
ganamos getting hot and this was

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,030
somewhere i think it was around like

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:05,070
1998 at the linux expo and i don't mean

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,320
the linux world conference & expo I mean

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,230
Linux expo which was in the

00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:15,800
raleigh-durham area sort of Red Hat's

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:19,470
backyard Miguel had a talk on genome and

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,060
he had the big theater you know he had

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,260
the one with the with the seats that

00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,810
went up and all this sort of stuff

00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,450
people were packed people were standing

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,630
against the walls waiting to hear

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:33,990
because genome was hot we wanted to see

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:37,080
what was coming in genome and Miguel got

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,000
up there and as I understand it he had a

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,780
laptop that was designed for the Mexican

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,610
market and I don't know whether that

00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,350
specifically had to do with the problem

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:51,090
but whatever it was that lap laptop

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:55,470
refused to sync with the projector so

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:57,990
there were no slides what's more his

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,110
slides like most of the people here his

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,440
slides were his notes so not only were

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:08,210
there no slides there were no notes a

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:13,440
room full of people expectedly waiting a

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:15,440
geek with no formal you know management

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,150
training how to present blah blah blah

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,210
and quite honestly I don't know if he

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,710
would have probably felt more more at

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,240
home doing it in Spanish than English

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,370
although he's quite you know fluent in

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,550
both but you know so I mean he's got all

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,760
these things working against him and he

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:36,820
stood there and he talked for an hour

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,880
and he was funny and he was interesting

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,610
he was informative and at the end he got

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,019
a standing ovation and he didn't get a

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:49,389
standing ovation out of pity or sympathy

00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:55,840
he got a standing ovation because he

00:18:49,389 --> 00:19:01,769
aced it here's a geek who speaks who

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:08,110
thinks presents and who makes people

00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:10,750
excited this was different how many

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:19,450
people know that british comedy IT Crowd

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:21,909
oh cool that was the image of the of the

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,110
geek the guys will you know for people

00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:26,830
i'm saying the guys locked in the

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,179
basement who no one ever saw who just

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,450
sat there and played with their little

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:33,700
machinery and basically had a hard time

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,440
interacting with other human beings that

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,120
was that was supposed to be our lives

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,860
and instead people are standing up there

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,600
talking and they're doing the things

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,669
that only management was supposed to do

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,399
only the business people were supposed

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:51,730
to do and we were doing it where we were

00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:54,340
acing it and I you know I think to how

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,049
many professionally trained management

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:01,299
people I know who would have crumpled up

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:05,610
like a paper ball faced with that same

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:11,889
situation but he didn't he excelled

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:14,080
because he spoke from the heart so in

00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:17,379
the early free and open source movement

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,970
the code was incredibly important it's

00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:21,159
the output it's the thing that enabled

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,399
others the four freedoms highly

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:29,230
important it's the enabler but the

00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:31,539
people were the story it was us that was

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,870
changing we learned to think for

00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:37,799
ourselves to speak for ourselves we even

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:42,460
learned to write for ourselves and

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,379
suddenly we became empowered you know

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,090
for me I worked for a little company

00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:47,140
called digital equipment corporation how

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,250
many people remember digital

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,500
and I had one of those employment

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,210
contracts that said the dreams that

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,420
occur to me on my pillow at night

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,090
belonged to the company that's the way

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,520
the IP stuff was was worried so I

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,930
couldn't I couldn't code in the open

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,690
source world because that belong to the

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,190
company but they had this little thing

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,940
there that they said thought thought

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,960
leadership is good so if you publish if

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,150
you write if you speak we'll give you a

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,360
buzz back even a little bit of an

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,920
incentive so it's like okay well you're

00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,570
not gonna let me code I'll start

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,000
shooting off my mouth and that's how I

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,770
started writing in the open source world

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,100
I would never been trained as a writer

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,980
and then later when compact 8 digital

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,940
and I got stuck in one of the post

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,770
takeover layoffs I'm at home trying to

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,110
figure out what to do next and I got

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,570
contacted by the publisher of InfoWorld

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,280
magazine you said we just lost our open

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,970
source columnist I've read your work

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,200
would you like to work for us and so

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:58,000
that started a couple of years of me

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,410
writing professionally which was the

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,100
weirdest thing because that was not on

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:05,320
my radar but because I took the step

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,170
that was available to me my world

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:12,220
changed and there were a lot of us who

00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:16,690
ended up doing that sort of thing and it

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,270
also began economic power remember as I

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,250
said in the you know the early days

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,410
professionally you know you got your

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,290
salary you're lucky you had a job blah

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,120
blah blah blah you know if you remember

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,070
if you're old enough to remember back

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,380
then well it's a good thing you have a

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,420
job that's all you know and you didn't

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,350
have much power it was around the same

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:42,610
time that just before the dot-com era

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,650
turned into the dot bomb era I remember

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,730
working at deck and they needed a couple

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:54,070
very particular networking people very

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:55,330
particular skill sets and the I was

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,060
talking with a manager who said yeah

00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,070
well I found these two guys they're open

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,130
source guys

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,190
they got the skills I need but I went

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,690
and talked with them they say yeah we'll

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,840
work for you we want a hundred fifty

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,659
thousand dollars each now this is

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,200
fifteen years ago and that was probably

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:19,950
about twice what that manager was

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,110
thinking of trying to offer it's like

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,539
what so I mean the manager was like

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:28,620
floored like are you kidding me 150,000

00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:29,909
are you kidding me so he went away tried

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,230
to find other candidates couldn't find

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,889
out other candidates not as good as

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,450
these fellows so we said well I'm gonna

00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:39,000
go back and I'm going to talk I see if I

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,350
can talk him down a bit maybe so he goes

00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,850
back to the guys a couple weeks later

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,850
said no thanks we already found jobs

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:52,169
this didn't happen no one bid for our

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,879
services before we weren't something to

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:58,220
be desired we were simply something to

00:23:53,879 --> 00:24:03,809
be hired this was a different world now

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:06,990
back in the late 90s the thing of the

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,360
open-source job was the brass ring you

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:13,610
know it was the grand goal and it was

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,990
you know it was more a dream than a goal

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,370
because I remember talking to you know

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,870
one guy at one of these early

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,059
conferences and he's saying and it'd be

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,850
so cool oh it's been so cool if we

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,750
should get paid to do this and happy

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:30,509
Sokka and it wasn't so much the business

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,580
sort of goal as it is the dream that you

00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:34,830
know the 13 year old has of you know

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,389
marrying the supermodel is one of those

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,029
things that ain't going to happen but it

00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:40,590
doesn't keep you from thinking about it

00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:42,600
that's kind of where the whole notion of

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,399
an open source job was back then it was

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,360
fiction but you like thinking about the

00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:50,519
fiction and that's really what it was

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,929
and the few people who actually got paid

00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,850
to do something and open source they had

00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:55,379
like an aura around him you kind of like

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,750
saddled up to him hoping that some of it

00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:59,970
was going to rub off on you I mean even

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,730
the people at Red Hat you know what you

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:05,220
think North great and mighty red at even

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,870
back then you know they didn't know

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,720
whether next quarter the company was

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,360
going to go under Mad Dog fall how many

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,500
people know mad dog

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,210
rest you need you to get to know mad dog

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:21,990
Hall mad dogs been around forever and

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:23,550
Mad Dog tells the story of being at one

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,670
of these early conferences in seeing Bob

00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:29,340
Young who is the early chief cook and

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,140
bottle washer for red hat seeing Bob

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,680
young and he's got his staff around him

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:38,070
he pulls out this wad of bills and he

00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,610
starts peeling off bills and giving it

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:45,690
to people for expense money to go get

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,630
food and lodging and mad dog went up to

00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,600
Bob afterwards and said what's with this

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,460
thing with them with the bills he said

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,640
oh that's the receivables for the

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,440
company I have to be careful how we give

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,100
it out because otherwise we won't have

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,370
enough money to get back home you know

00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,790
that was where things were open source

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,830
jobs were really really tentative

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,750
because it wasn't the big players it was

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,870
just these little mom-and-pop shops that

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,360
were trying to stay afloat so everything

00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:23,520
was tenuous and you didn't have

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,080
stability you know today hey brass ring

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,770
achieved you know we had the show of

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,590
hands earlier we are populated with

00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,690
open-source people professional

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,160
open-source people I maybe go to a linux

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,980
foundation particularly a lynx

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,240
foundation conference you know and I

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,830
asked the question how many people have

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,290
an open-source job every hand that room

00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,200
is going to go up except for a couple of

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,790
PR people or something like this open

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,420
source has got the legitimacy that we

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:54,450
hope for you know we don't have the

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,190
scoffers even bear adore and Redmond is

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,250
not as ominous as once but people have

00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,170
to remember you know for younger people

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:04,110
Microsoft was the Great Satan once upon

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,300
a time everyone you know hated loathed

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,560
was suspicious of what's Microsoft going

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,940
to do next are they going to try to land

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,810
on us are they going to try to destroy

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,640
us you know suddenly these days people

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,610
are not talking about what the parent

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:22,080
company of Nokia is going to do next

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:23,990
it's a different world so you know it

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,960
seems like we have everything together

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:32,580
but has that brass ring in some areas is

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,100
it turning into brass handcuffs some of

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,860
us have open source jobs that I consider

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:41,309
real open source jobs I've got one thank

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:45,179
you lord I am Zen project evangelist I

00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:48,120
get a paycheck from Citrix what are my

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:51,720
goals my goals are to make sure that Zen

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,590
project is healthy you know numerated in

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:59,580
various ways citrix has a whole bunch of

00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:02,909
zen leveraging products which is

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,909
wonderful but if they make money or

00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:08,269
don't make money it has nothing to do

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:10,379
with with me as an individual I

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,490
generally like to see them make money

00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:14,039
because if they make money they'll

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,320
hopefully keep sending me a check which

00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:19,529
is kind of cool but other than that I

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,870
really have no you know I have my own

00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:26,250
voice I can actually stand up here and

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:29,299
talk about stuff like this unfortunately

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,789
I have to start asking the question are

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:35,970
we sacrificing our jobs for our

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:39,149
empowerment some cases yes some cases

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,889
know so I let just ask you you know ask

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:42,240
these questions of yourself are you

00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:46,769
allowed to make your own open-source

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,919
decisions if you're doing coding do you

00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:53,879
have the leeway to commit things to the

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,100
project that are your ideas and not what

00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:59,850
the company is paying you to do maybe on

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,909
your own time you can you contribute the

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,649
way you want to you have your own voice

00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,600
or your you just a corporate voice I

00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:08,909
mean you go to some of these these

00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,259
larger conferences and the first

00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:13,470
question is who are you the next

00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:17,549
question is who do you work for as if

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:21,779
that establishes your voice well that

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,159
wasn't the issue 15 years ago you get to

00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:25,440
the question of who you work for at some

00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,269
point the question is the second

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,419
question was always what are you working

00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:33,330
on what's of interest to you what

00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:35,690
project what are you doing that was the

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,690
discussion

00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:42,460
are we becoming depending on our job

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,120
becoming more of that corporate power

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:48,310
too in recent years you know as I said I

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,800
kind of had to fade off the open source

00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:55,450
circuit and come back in because my

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:59,200
employment I've noted what I were I

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,720
called fake open source fakin open

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,260
source I define as a project that has

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,600
the right license it's GPL it's maybe

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:12,870
it's BSD I don't know something it's

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:17,380
open source license but it was created

00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:19,950
with a closed source mindset you had a

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,030
group of guys working inside a room

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,770
putting the code together they throw it

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,140
over the wall slap a license on and say

00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:30,040
it's open source this came to light to

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,990
me in the last job I was in when my boss

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,260
decided we wanted a portal we wanted an

00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:38,140
open source affordable like okay cool so

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:40,240
he went out and we found one that had

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,150
the right license everything else seemed

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,960
to be pretty usable so we went to hire

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,900
somebody to come in as a consultant and

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:52,240
make it work for us the way we want it

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:54,550
that's when we found out something we

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,320
couldn't hire anyone who either didn't

00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,600
work for the company that produced it or

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,070
didn't used to work for the company that

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,870
produced it we found one guy we ended up

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,930
having to bring him on board to do it

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:10,810
only one guy though that wasn't in that

00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:12,760
category of being a current or ex

00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:16,140
employee of the organization that put it

00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:20,770
together there is something wrong here

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:27,880
the organism which is open source the

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:29,770
people the community wasn't there so

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,980
there without that without that

00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:34,180
community there is no empowerment

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,410
because you got a bunch of people

00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,940
sitting in a room doing what they're

00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:42,130
told they're being the power tools of

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:46,660
someone else it was just a job I was at

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:47,890
a the community what's called community

00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,440
leadership summit

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:52,960
that comes before Ross Khan last year

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,250
and we did a little you know it's an

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,230
unconference so we had a bunch of people

00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,120
sitting around a table talking about

00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,590
stuff like this and I asked the question

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,530
how many people have all the source jobs

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,750
and probably you know eighty percent of

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,030
the people gathered round raised their

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,720
hand I said how many people if those

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,090
jobs went away tomorrow would still be

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,680
involved in open source inside some way

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:19,780
shape or form maybe not the same way as

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:23,260
today some hands went down not a lot but

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:26,830
some hands went down now these are the

00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,300
cream of the crop you folks have come

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,150
out to a conference like this you're

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,520
motivated you've got something going on

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,650
in your head and these people went to

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,180
that conference and some of them would

00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,910
have bowed out and gone to work for

00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,730
Microsoft next week and not think

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:45,820
anything of it there's something wrong

00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:48,840
with that picture because they're

00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,840
missing the heart

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,380
so I have to ask the question is success

00:32:53,090 --> 00:33:00,110
killing open source are we poisoning our

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,990
own roots by forgetting where we came

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,430
from do we understand the history you

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,890
know one of the things I really noticed

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:09,440
when I was away for a few years and came

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,980
back into the conference circuit so many

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,240
of the people that I knew aren't here

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:19,130
now you have to expect that people come

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,400
and go and change and some burnout and

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:24,110
some go on to different jobs I get that

00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,270
but a thing I also noticed was that when

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:29,390
we started to talk about history the

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,820
newer people didn't know the history of

00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,100
the older people they didn't know where

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,720
we came from therefore they didn't

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,130
realize that they may be missing

00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,580
something when they came aboard I heard

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:49,040
about a company over in Asia that hired

00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:52,040
100 open source developers don't know

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,590
details but I if I were a betting man

00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,610
I'd probably bet a week's salary and win

00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:00,800
that if we went and we took a look at

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,320
those people they were not open source

00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,930
developers they were people working in a

00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,940
closed source mindset who were dealing

00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:12,020
and producing code that had right

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:15,620
license on they're not empowered they're

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,110
not feeling the difference they're not

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,560
becoming part of the community in the

00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,560
same way

00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:28,990
so this slides actually old because up

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,320
to about maybe about 20 conferences in

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:35,350
the past year and a half and this is

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,180
what I'm seeing these conference I love

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,270
coming to these regional conferences

00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:43,180
because the enthusiasms here I was in

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,510
Texas in Austin last week texas linux

00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:51,670
fest another splendid splendid

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:54,580
conference linux west northwest few

00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:59,740
weeks back again the enthusiasm it's

00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:02,890
great but we have to make sure that we

00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,360
are telling one another our stories we

00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,600
have to make sure that the history is

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:10,750
not lost with new people and that we

00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:14,890
also have to bring out into the for the

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:17,710
knowledge that we are here not just

00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:21,940
because it's collaboration or what have

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:25,210
you but it's empowering to be here and I

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,580
don't hear that statement going on and

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:30,940
as I said before if the cream of the

00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,320
crop some hands go down when I say are

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,780
you going to be an open source tomorrow

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,870
if your job goes away what about the

00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,380
rest of these people what about the

00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:43,060
people on your project if you're sure

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,030
coding what about the people at your

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:49,360
place of work who may be you know using

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:54,780
open source technology do they get it do

00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,780
they know who's going to tell them

00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,430
my segment is that we are at the point

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,800
we're not sitting at the precipice

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:12,460
waiting to dive off I mean it's not a

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,190
dire situation but we can lose our way

00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:22,930
and we can't lose our way slowly and

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:25,630
gradually unless we teach one another we

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:29,170
have to tell other people about the

00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,880
empowering side of open source we have

00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,110
to tell one another the new people come

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,570
into your project and new people who

00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:36,580
come into your place of work let them

00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:41,160
know this is not just the same old same

00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:46,690
old that there's something else here and

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:48,820
it's not about going to some course on

00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,390
how to lecture people and getting a

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:55,980
really snazzy suit and you know when

00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:59,040
learning how to do PowerPoint yeah crap

00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,390
it's about letting what's in here out

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,220
you know I see it when we walk through

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,859
the halls and I see people talking with

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,880
one another the enthusiasm is there we

00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:09,850
just have to make sure that we're

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,500
sharing that we're saying this means

00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:16,359
something this means something to me and

00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:20,920
the more you you can share your own

00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:27,100
story with other people the more power

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:31,109
there is in the room so the assignment

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:34,590
that I'm asking you to undertake is this

00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:38,280
go ahead and tell people what you know

00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:41,020
who can tell your story better than you

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,380
have you come to some sort of knowledge

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,590
in your own dealings with thing as a

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:50,020
sense of liberation a sense of

00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,520
empowerment maybe economic maybe maybe

00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,780
personal maybe it's just you know the

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,980
thrill of getting some code out there

00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,650
and people are using it and they're

00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:00,340
saying that's really cool that's

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,930
something or maybe it's some getting up

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,250
and standing in front of other learning

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,900
that you can stand up in front of other

00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,930
people I mean this is rocket science

00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,510
compared to where we thought we what we

00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,000
thought we could do 30 years ago people

00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,380
would just be horrified

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,580
notion of a geek getting up and talking

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,290
and yet this you know this look this

00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:23,400
long weekend has proved time and time

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:27,210
again it's very very possible we can do

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,510
this because we have a voice and we have

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:35,670
a value passion Trump's PowerPoint any

00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:37,860
day you know I remember back just after

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:43,050
the earth's surface cooled and I got out

00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:44,730
of college the Vice President a little

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,400
software company I was working with back

00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,690
then was talking to me and he said you

00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,390
know I was doing development at the time

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:54,630
and he said Russ when you show me the

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:58,290
new feature for the new version of our

00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:02,940
software I want you to convince me that

00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:06,780
this is the best thing I want to know

00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,100
when I go into my selling situation that

00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,010
I'm going to be doing the customer a

00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:15,380
disfavor if I allow him to buy the other

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:17,790
guys stuck because ours is better why

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,300
because when I go in there and I'm

00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:23,910
convinced there's going to be a look in

00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:29,090
my eye and a sound in my voice that says

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:33,510
I'm telling the truth and the truth is

00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:36,840
powerful and that's one of the great

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:41,490
things about this movement we've got

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:44,660
truth with us we're not lying to one

00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:47,700
another we're not selling one another

00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,880
we're talking to one another and sharing

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:55,590
what we know to be true there's power in

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:59,880
that we cannot discount that that will

00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:01,830
beat the PowerPoint people any day so if

00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,220
you know something share it talk about

00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:10,290
it be enthusiastic about leaked all over

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:12,890
people you know how many people have

00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,630
been to maybe some sort of you know

00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,700
standard closed-source software

00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,160
conference and the fella and it's

00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,990
usually a fellow stands up in front of

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,230
the room and he's wearing a suit that is

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,710
more expensive than my car

00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:31,109
and he says look what I have wrought see

00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:33,540
the Magnificent things that I've brought

00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:36,330
about through my marvelous mind and the

00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:39,750
nameless minions behind me see how

00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:45,420
wonderful stand applaud applaud applaud

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:47,130
me we were used to that if you've been

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,950
in this industry for a while you're used

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:52,380
to that but in the open source world

00:40:49,950 --> 00:41:00,570
it's not the guy or the gal standing up

00:40:52,380 --> 00:41:01,859
here that matters it's you so open

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,240
source is all about participation i

00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,960
watch all the stand up if you got legs

00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,670
that work stand up for a second now

00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:12,270
you're all doing dutifully looking at

00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:14,070
the guy up front don't I want you to

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:16,260
turn around and look at any other group

00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,300
of people in the room individual people

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,030
I'm going to stand and stare at this

00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,310
fellow over here okay you're looking at

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,350
somebody you know what you're looking at

00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,930
you're looking at the reason why you're

00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,609
here you're looking at an open-source

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,320
person who's using it they're learning

00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:33,720
about it maybe they're developing who

00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,060
knows but they're part of us they're the

00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,210
reason why we're here so give them a

00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,210
hand

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:49,420
okay be seated so that's it I just

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,880
wanted to thank you all for coming out

00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:58,780
on a Sunday morning first off but that's

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,090
the essence of what concerns me this is

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,770
not some lies i said before you know

00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,970
I've had given this talk and people say

00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,650
oh you know you're just being doom and

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:09,940
gloom and you know it's not that bad

00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:12,280
it's not that bad yet but if you've got

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,830
a cancer the time to get rid of that

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,880
cancer is when it's this big rather than

00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:21,520
when it's this big and the thing is

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,220
there is this big out there there are

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,550
those jobs out there that are taking our

00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,040
voices and we're not talking about we're

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,480
not thinking about it so the more we

00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:36,840
talk about it and think about it and

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:40,810
tell others what this all means to us

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,640
more likely it is that we can get that

00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:49,960
out of here and keep it from being a

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:53,800
problem in a bigger sense questions good

00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,140
morning I just want to ask how does open

00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,230
source free open source or open source

00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:02,080
protect the efforts of people let's save

00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:05,530
corporations make use of it and some

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,200
type of commercial development project

00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:12,370
and presented to the public maybe just a

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,480
little bit more elaborate so as far as

00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,360
like a lot of software they have

00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,030
licenses and so forth mm-hmm but I can

00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:21,580
see where all this activity is absorbed

00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:24,670
into a more elaborate commercial product

00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,590
hmm so is their protection there in the

00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,230
open source world for what people do

00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:31,330
well I don't know exactly what you mean

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,840
by protection except that if you mean

00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:37,090
protection in terms of giving credit

00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,270
where credit is due let's start with

00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:41,800
that the good thing about most free and

00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,280
open source license particularly like

00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,050
the GPL says that you have to open up

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,640
the code so that the code is there and

00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:53,020
the names are attached to the code or

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,800
whatever means that project operates so

00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,510
that publish

00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,550
part is out there the other thing is

00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,570
that no like in a company like Citrix

00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:05,920
were where that pays me they have a

00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:07,870
number of products that leverage the Zen

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,770
project hypervisor as part of their

00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:13,180
product set and they're free to go out

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,260
and you know make money with that that's

00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:19,660
fine but they can't hide the fact that

00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:23,590
it's still leveraging what we do and who

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:26,020
we are they can't say no no you can't do

00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:30,490
this or that that's for us to decide as

00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:32,860
project members so I mean we have our

00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:34,090
autonomy others can come along and use

00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,030
it and there's nothing wrong with others

00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:39,340
other people using it and we consider

00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,320
that a sign of success generally that

00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,180
you want to be solving someone's problem

00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,500
and whether it's a person whether it's a

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,170
mom-and-pop shop or whether it's a

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,490
multinational corporation we're solving

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,740
their problem that's good we've done

00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:52,570
something worthwhile hopefully someone's

00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,730
getting value but the big thing is we

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,830
have to make sure and we do this

00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:00,880
generally through licensing and through

00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:02,530
our governance that we are not forgotten

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,960
and we are not cast over and the

00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:08,980
licensing particularly inside most free

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,290
and open-source licenses require a level

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,420
of acknowledgment or at least inability

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:16,180
to cover up who we are and what we've

00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,430
done and we still have you know like I

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,250
said even those Citrix has products that

00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:23,440
use said project if you want to use in

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,720
project can go ahead and you're not

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,580
going to spend a dollar you know other

00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,350
than download time or whatever else you

00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,050
want and that's the way it is with

00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:34,210
everything in this community it's there

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,960
if someone wants to roll it together and

00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,640
put a bow on it and you know add a

00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,990
little special sauce to the top well

00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,490
that's if their business and they want

00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:48,960
to charge or you know some money for

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:51,850
whatever but we don't have to I remember

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,200
more than once I've talked with people

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,210
who are trying to start up you know

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,890
small organizations or a small company

00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,290
or something a mom-and-pop type

00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:02,560
organization they said yeah well we got

00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:05,680
a PC but we need an office software and

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,840
that costs more than the pc does

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,660
they said well you know openoffice

00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,360
libreoffice these things you can just

00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:16,160
download and go and they're even for the

00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:19,670
most part compatible with the stuff that

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,790
you're used to using it's like wow and

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:26,720
that's that's where we can make the huge

00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:28,310
difference on that micro level where we

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,630
can enable individuals and you know

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:31,100
that's frequently what we talk about

00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,780
when we talk about the value of open

00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,670
source and that is that's a tremendous

00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,650
value that we're giving to people who

00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:40,190
don't have the opportunity we're giving

00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:43,100
them opportunity but at the macro level

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:46,850
we're also getting opportunity by doing

00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:49,690
what we're doing and so that's part of

00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:53,020
my concern design answer your question

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:58,610
any other questions or comments

00:46:53,020 --> 00:47:02,240
spitballs flaming bricks thrown from my

00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:06,470
window hey Russell this is ben francis

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:10,240
from passports and my question is to

00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:14,870
what extent is the whole revelations of

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,780
NSA mass surveillance of companies and

00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:20,830
in companies that don't want to play

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,450
just get get shut down like lavabit did

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:26,930
what extent is that going to push open

00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:29,440
source into a breathe new life into the

00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:33,140
open source movement in government and

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,100
commercial entities okay yeah it's a

00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:39,920
good question most people heard about

00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:43,760
you know the revelations last year of

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,570
the NSA reportedly tapping Angela

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,120
Merkel's phone Chancellor of Germany I

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:54,350
happen to be in Europe when that broke

00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:56,530
oh my god the difference in the coverage

00:47:54,350 --> 00:48:00,710
over there as opposed to over here I

00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:03,260
mean I I was I remember sending messages

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:08,120
to my wife I said what's the coverage

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:09,440
like at home about this story and I got

00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,200
a text back i said well I've been

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:16,230
watching the morning news for 25 minutes

00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,720
and finally they did a 45 seconds

00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:21,930
ment on it after spending eight minutes

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,900
about whether brett favre suffered a

00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:27,990
concussion that you know is going to you

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:32,550
know do nastiness to his life or

00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:35,090
something like it's like what over in

00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,260
Europe you had people breathing fire

00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:42,859
literally I was at a conference and

00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:45,180
people were pissed and rightfully so and

00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:47,430
one of the things that I think is

00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:52,290
probably not as prevalent here as it is

00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:54,600
in parts other than here is that you had

00:48:52,290 --> 00:49:00,150
an immense wave that was going through

00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:05,520
people saying no longer can we be can we

00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:08,840
rely on the output of a country that may

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:12,960
not have our best interest in heart and

00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:16,500
the way that rolls out is open source is

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,090
better because we can look into the code

00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,760
and determine if there's something

00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:26,640
sneaky in there and if there is we can

00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:31,590
fix it whereas the microsoft desktop the

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:34,800
apple etc etc these clothes devices that

00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:38,790
happen to come from the US of A who

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,880
knows what's underneath them we don't so

00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:45,780
I think when you get when you get out of

00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,300
the confines of our country it is very

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:56,670
much in the minds of people that open

00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:58,980
source is a much safer way to go I think

00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,960
it was what are those of the keynote

00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,240
morning keynote yesterday where the

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,600
gentleman was talking about various

00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,420
things that relate to this and you go

00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:12,869
down a long rabbit trail saying that

00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,430
there is there should be more concerned

00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:17,330
here than there is about some of the

00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:19,740
things that have gone on absolutely but

00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:22,950
but once you cross the national boundary

00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,829
it's absolutely clear that open source

00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:29,180
is a preferred model

00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:31,099
poor just about anything a follow-up to

00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,109
that weren't they well aware that their

00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:35,239
own country is doing that was doing talk

00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:37,670
about that way over there cuz a lot of

00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:40,940
European countries do the same thing not

00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:42,799
that any of its good yeah I think there

00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,509
is some knowledge of it it's you know

00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:48,529
once again that was not the issue of the

00:50:44,509 --> 00:50:51,170
of the morning but but once again eat

00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:53,299
especially inside let's take Europe

00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:56,059
you've got this conglomeration of

00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:57,709
nations that are supposedly working

00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,989
together but at the same time you know

00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:03,319
there are staring each others back doors

00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:06,769
like you know for you what are you doing

00:51:03,319 --> 00:51:08,150
you know that sort of thing so once

00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:11,630
again open source makes perfect sense

00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:14,779
for them as well because rather than

00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:16,099
they can't do it all themselves so the

00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:18,019
best thing to do it is that open

00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:20,089
collaboration which everyone talks about

00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:22,009
in the open source world where you can

00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:24,849
look at the stuff and you can decide and

00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:27,709
if you find something that's wrong key

00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:33,019
pull it out and replace it with

00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:34,099
something so so whether whether we you

00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:36,259
know I don't want to get saddled too

00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:38,749
much on the NSA specifically but i think

00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:42,609
the sense out there in the greater world

00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:46,039
is open source makes sense open source

00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:48,859
makes more sense in this world where we

00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:52,969
live where there is sneakiness and

00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:55,910
danger than trusting a black box that

00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:59,380
you got from parts unknown or from the

00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,380
other guy wherever the other guy is

00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:03,819
questions comments

00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:08,259
well once again thank you very much for

00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:16,419
showing you how to Sunday morning I

00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:18,369
appreciate it your customers rely on

00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:20,619
your website or application if it's

00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:23,949
slower non-responsive it infuriates your

00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:25,779
users and costs you money keeping your

00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:29,200
business critical systems humming along

00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:32,109
requires insight into what they're doing

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,089
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:36,339
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,530
resource limitations and other problems

00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:40,420
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,030
your systems performance metrics in

00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,880
real-time and record this data for later

00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,859
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,900
see what's really going on under the

00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,030
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,010
visualize the status of all your systems

00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:56,740
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:59,859
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:02,320
memory swap processes load and network

00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:04,900
usage click a specific system to access

00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,910
its individual dashboard then click and

00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,880
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,890
more detail comprehensive network data

00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,589
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,180
is available on the network tab and disk

00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:18,070
rights and free space on the disk

00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,920
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:23,470
displays usage statistics for individual

00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,630
processes the system info tab shows

00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:27,880
listening services active connections

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:30,010
and available updates adding long view

00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,690
to a system is easy just click the

00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,849
button copy the one line installation

00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,280
command then run the command on your

00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:37,990
linux system to complete the process the

00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,180
agent will begin collecting data and

00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:41,980
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:44,590
start rolling

00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:46,960
use longview to gain visibility into

00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:50,700
your servers so when your website or app

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,700
