the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,189

org the southeast linux fest would like

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,859
to thank the following diamond sponsors

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,970
in 2014 for helping make these videos

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,849
possible okay so um we're going to talk

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:33,239
today about AP ice and we're going to

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,880
talk today about the cheap part of AP is

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,800
this is not as usual with any of my

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,480
talks I'm not going to give you any sort

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,340
of amazing revelations you're not going

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,840
to walk out of here with a oh my god I

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,309
didn't know any of these things this is

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,469
actually probably crap you already know

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,360
just like every time I ever speak but if

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,160
you don't know something that I say you

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,140
should be deeply deeply embarrassed and

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,469
don't come up and tell me later so as

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,960
with yesterday I am Michael Alvis I am a

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,149
DevOps consultant and I am probably not

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,470
a shape-shifting mind-controlling lizard

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,479
man that link is live when they upload

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,040
this you have to go see those people

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:17,100
they're hilarious I am lawful evil

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,340
nutrit indices I am a kind of a so

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,170
I don't like the idea of people telling

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,479
me what to do but I love telling other

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,979
people what to do so if you're also like

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
me then this is going to be terrible for

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,920
you this is my twitter handle my blog

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,329
they are becoming more useful i suppose

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,369
as time goes by um you are the other

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,140
kind you are almost certainly a

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,630
developer if you are interested in this

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,729
at all or have any interest in this kind

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,560
of idea but you might be in operations

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,259
because api is live and practically

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,880
every part of what we do you probably

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,740
write code of some sort but it might be

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,060
able shell scripts i was going to say

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,520
 shell scripts but i'm going to

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,189
mean that you might even document some

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,869
of that but you probably don't you

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,000
probably don't document stuff because

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,890
it's sort of not what you do for a

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,630
living but that's okay you might also

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,369
realize that your code is typically kind

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,050
of hard to deal with but you also

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,640
probably don't because you wrote it was

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,210
pretty easy for you now

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,640
um people we have there's an enormous

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,290
amount of code in the world that's

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,530
available for us for in a variety of

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,400
ways we use a lot of it every day who in

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:31,110
here is fairly proficient with said okay

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:35,440
who in here believes said has an API

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,180
everything has an API so if you you said

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,890
then you use something that has an API

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,200
if you've become proficient with the set

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,360
API specifically if you've become

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,070
provision with whatever version of regex

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,860
is working with your version of said

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,230
then you have a specific iteration of

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,090
that API that you are good with you're

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,620
probably really annoyed with all other

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,920
iterations that don't work the way that

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,140
yours do and this sort of thing is how

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,970
we get work done we don't do it all

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,709
ourselves there's a pile of other stuff

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,019
in the world if you just go look in

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,860
search Navin org there are tens of

00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:11,980
thousands of Java libraries just Java

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,750
just the evil evil Java that people have

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,280
written and provided for other people to

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,579
use they get used all over the place

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,519
about 75% of those suck I mean they just

00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,260
do the 75 percent that don't suck are

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,940
the ones that are have been have been

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,340
replacing the ones that do most of the

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,100
time but that's not always true we want

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,530
to use your code as developers we would

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,820
like to use your code we really want to

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,410
use your code because we don't want to

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,140
do whatever stupid crap it is that you

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,600
spent the time working on so that we

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,940
don't do what that task as we want to do

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,860
it we really really want to use your

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:50,200
code because we're lazy and we find it

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,630
incredibly effing hard to use your code

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,329
I know this is a big revelation for a

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,150
lot of people but it is super super hard

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,519
to use most other people's code I mean

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,190
I'm talking about like how to use system

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,560
dot out in Java or how to do print line

00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,420
in a in a thousand other scripting

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,420
languages or whatever I'm talking about

00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,950
how to use you know ops for I wouldn't

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,160
call anybody out on this this anybody in

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:18,039
here used Roth the OAuth authorization

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,320
mechanism was it fun the first time you

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,789
did it is it fun the fifteenth time you

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,640
tried to make it work hell no it's not

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,020
it's hard to use is a really good

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,509
authorization mechanism

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,750
damn right it is but it's hard to use

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:33,669
and did it need to be hard to use no we

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:39,729
didn't need to be hard to use no it

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:42,370
didn't it didn't need to be okay it was

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,259
going to be hard to be to use but it

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,180
didn't need to be that's not that those

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,740
two things aren't the same thing you

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,080
know it was inevitable that it was going

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,300
to be hard to use but it is it doesn't

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,849
need to be all I want to do is take some

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,830
credential pass it to some system have

00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:00,909
that thing tell me to piss off because

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,830
I'm not an actual user or log me in and

00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:04,150
let me see my porn or whatever it was I

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,060
was going to watch I'm not really good

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,919
mommy porn got it okay the other problem

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,490
is is that when P you when you're hard

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,340
hard hard to use API comes up you're not

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,469
very helpful at fixing that problem I

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,090
know you guys all everybody in here

00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,490
y'all are not like that I totally get

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,870
that you showed up itself you self

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:28,960
selected to come to self you are kind of

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,969
here because you know a lot of things go

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,370
awry when it comes to these things I'm

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:35,199
talking to you guys the people that

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,000
we're recording for the people who are

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,990
out there going I didn't make it to self

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,909
but that's okay because I know

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,190
everything there is to know about doing

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:45,909
everything ever you're not very helpful

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,969
you don't give me good advice you don't

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:51,729
give me easy to use applications you

00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:54,520
don't give me easy to use interfaces you

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,690
don't give me easy to use rest api's for

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,680
God's sake that ought to be the easiest

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:03,400
thing in the world to do but it's not as

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,719
anybody here ever used no I can't use

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,949
that I actually still have a

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:08,339
relationship with them i'm going to go

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,639
ahead and skip that

00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:14,379
for most developers this is what you see

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,749
you wrote this thing you're like this is

00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,129
awesome look how awesome it is the

00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:20,589
people that mark we're talking about a

00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,770
minute ago who did write the OAuth API

00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,270
probably think a lot looks like this

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,929
they probably go what's your problem

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,869
you're just not smart enough to use our

00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:33,849
well maybe i'm not i'm a i'm a

00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:35,979
relatively bright guy at least I think I

00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:38,770
am but maybe I'm not smart enough to use

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:42,610
your incredibly complicated system maybe

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,680
i'm not i'm ok but to me it looks a hell

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,330
of a lot more like this you may see

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,599
what's on the other side of that right

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,369
there I know what is because I actually

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,430
stole this picture from the internet but

00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:56,499
can you tell what's through that window

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,389
no of course you can I think it's a

00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,469
bridge by the way but I'm not a hundred

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,050
percent sure think it's got a lot of

00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:05,679
graffiti on it but your software is a

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,449
filthy filthy window into your API is a

00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:10,059
ridiculously filthy window into your

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:13,089
software it is how we see inside your

00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:15,909
stuff I don't care what the heck is

00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:18,039
going on behind there I don't care as

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,959
long as it doesn't bleed crap all over

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,300
the rest of my stuff I don't care what

00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,939
your application does what your library

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,829
does what you're you know widget does I

00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,409
don't care i just want it to do what i

00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,999
want it to do the thing you told me it

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,099
would do i'll bet it does that i'll bet

00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:35,559
your software actually works i know for

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:38,499
a fact OAuth works I know it does

00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,940
because I've made it work but afterwards

00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:44,580
I took a shower

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,970
and and it wasn't just because I felt

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,550
dirtiest cuz I had worked up a sweat so

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,650
when you when you give me a thing to use

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,840
trying to make it so that I can see

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,000
inside a little bit or at least so that

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,919
the the communication isn't through some

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,270
you know like some slot where a guy

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,930
opens something goes how you got the

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,550
password I didn't want to hear that

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,250
Bruno sent me I don't want to have to

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,039
tell her off that Bruno sent me because

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,080
that's that's that's that's actually

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,020
disabling me that's not enabling me

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,449
that's disabling me now api's come in

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,069
many many types many flavors we're all

00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,389
familiar with most of these things or if

00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,530
you're not that's okay because it

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:26,310
doesn't really matter they're all the

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:29,490
same rest so the soul webtype api's

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:33,060
there's they produce services almost all

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,070
of these talk at some service level they

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,709
have a they either have a port they talk

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,240
on or they you have a localized protocol

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,360
that you deal with something along those

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,700
lines there's also code interfaces

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,440
there's the the libraries of the world

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,399
the Java interfaces the Ruby definitions

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,750
or whatever you want to call them I

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,420
guess Ruby doesn't really have

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,070
interfaces i guess but having but but

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,260
what it meant ends up being duck type

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,779
capable applications things were you

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,880
know what you can talk to a piece of

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,370
software they've it's been published and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,459
then and that's the api for that thing

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,720
whatever it might be there's also

00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:12,120
command-line interfaces that are in fact

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,350
api's as I said said everything has an

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,540
API the the switches and the the inputs

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,250
Linux the UNIX world's been handling

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,130
this pretty well for a while there's

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,899
also a DSL a dsl is generally is

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,390
generally not considered to be an API

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,250
but in the end it's the way you drive a

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,860
piece of code in the back end so you can

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,240
kind of think of it like an API because

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,699
that's how you talk to that thing

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,640
services in the world typically have a

00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:40,980
stable endpoint somewhere that you know

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,470
how to talk to them if you're on what's

00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,180
what's the that's embarrassing what's

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,620
the port that my sequel talks on most of

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,570
the time 3306 yeah I think that's it so

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,480
when you talk to when you're talking to

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,649
buy sequel as a service you you

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
you know the host you know where it's

00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,610
running hope for you know where it's

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,889
running and you talk on your your client

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,230
talks on port 3306 and everybody's happy

00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:08,399
right you have it you you almost never

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:13,079
right network code to 3306 to drive my

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,120
sequel why do you not do that because

00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,550
it's an atrocious protocol they

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,709
literally have to provide you a client

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,709
to talk to you now this is not this is

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,500
not unusual like when your application

00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:28,230
is super super complicated you need

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
something to mitigate for you right so

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,209
you go i well there there's that API

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,240
alright one step further here's the API

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,800
use for whatever I'm doing right so if

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,380
you've got a let's say you're using my

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,620
sequel as your database you use some

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,329
sort of my sequel driver on your side to

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,730
mitigate a lot of that but then that my

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:49,649
sequel driver has a bunch of stuff on

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,050
the front side of it is the API that

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,930
you're physically now using to talk to

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,790
the database server now the my sequel

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,610
database drivers that I views are not

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,540
terrible I mean it's you you really

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,920
can't screw them up that bad i mean its

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,920
database drivers are a pretty they're a

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,540
pretty common lot um richards looks

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,220
pretty much exactly like everybody

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,130
else's you connect to the database you

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,990
execute some query you get some result

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,149
you parse through that result the end

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:22,620
update crud you know the crud work you

00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:25,230
do that well that's a different story

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,300
right so but they had they typically

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:31,290
live in the world with it with a with a

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,230
stable endpoint but they often are often

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,810
surfaces surfaces sheriff lifted often

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,310
services have multiple versions running

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,860
at the same time especially if you're in

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,199
a solo world where there might be some

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,079
back-end service some rest service that

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,790
i published it version 10 that has some

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,430
degree of functionality but then i

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,949
published it version 13 that has some

00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,690
different functionality and which one am

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,279
I talking to well there's a you know you

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,500
can have it be a stable end point where

00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,880
there's the 10 lives at this port and

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,589
one got three lines at this port or

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,269
whatever or you can have it be at the

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:06,120
same endpoint and just tell it which one

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:08,070
you want to talk to that sort of that

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,260
sort of instability in the background

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,210
havior is very common in a number of

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,830
services it might not be in your world

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,140
but it's actually super common in mind

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,670
because I have frequently have to deal

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,070
with people who do rolling deployments

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,170
and so when you release version 2 dot

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,540
five and they're still a version 18

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,520
living in production you just have to

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,960
live with that and it and everybody's

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,130
going to be talking on the same port so

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,750
that you got to have a way to figure out

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,510
how to talk to how to talk to everybody

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,250
at the same time you might do it by

00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,990
having a different in points or internal

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,050
routing protocols but probably what you

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,610
do probably what you do is you just rip

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,480
up the old one and stick the new one in

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,040
place you probably do that and when you

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,020
do that what you've done is you've

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,190
broken the contract you had with whoever

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,170
is using the old API if one dot eight is

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,900
not compatible with two dot whatever

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,120
then you have now broken the utility of

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,580
the people who were using 18 you just

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,580
snatch the rug out from under them now

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,820
is anybody in here ever done that gorge

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,110
yeah I did it last week I did a lot of

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,060
weird stuff last week come to think of

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,830
it I did a lot of Lily evil stuff last

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,350
week but I've done it I do it over and

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,180
over again because sometimes you know

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,530
aren't given a choice I'm not saying

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,060
that you do these things because you're

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,620
evil I'm saying you do them because

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,030
you're either lazy or you have more

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,310
stuff to do that you can't really fit

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,690
all the things in place now with

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,790
libraries libraries are foods the they

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,060
are they you deal with them with API

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,730
variants by deprecation usually I have a

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,340
and a I've released version 18 of a

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,020
thing I have now released version 19 of

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,200
a thing that is deprecating stuff that

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,180
happened in 15 a deprecation is

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,160
generally an indicator that says hey if

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,590
you're depending on this as of right now

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,910
I might take this away from you in the

00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,180
future you should probably get off of it

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,970
and that's a fairly common behavior for

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,090
api's and libraries um besides the

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,390
deprecation mechanism pretty much wide

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:09,990
open they can do they that you can do

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:14,100
anything you want two people inside your

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,600
code base now with applications the API

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,120
is generally the set of commands and

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,980
switches that you can do well I'm get is

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,750
one of my favorite examples of this get

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,510
has a huge know

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,790
of subcommands that you execute outside

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,370
of the in the get environment and then

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,140
an enormous number of switches that can

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,810
pretty much all be turned off with the

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,340
word no in front of them and as long as

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,740
you know what that is you kind of know

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,840
what the API of it all is the incredibly

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,690
complicated API yes I'm talking to you

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,940
dude the the incredibly complicated API

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,440
associated with dealing with get at the

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,450
command line as long as you can do this

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,970
you can use the tool at the way that

00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,610
it's meant to be used but and the UNIX

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,250
world almost always gets the

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,180
command-line API thing right

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,070
historically we have almost always

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,620
gotten it right where we said all right

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,690
most things right stuff to standard out

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,390
and they dump their errors to standard

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,610
error and they take from standard in and

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,820
so you can pipe the stuff left and right

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,790
we are we're used to that we've been

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,430
doing it for decades now I guess well

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,310
then except for the people that don't do

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,920
it anymore except for folks who go no no

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,610
no unix is just the environment I run

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,040
and and everything else can suck it so

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,530
in domain-specific languages this is

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,250
it's like a language to drive an API you

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,540
you have you give it commands and like a

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,730
database driver is almost exactly the

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,670
same way a database driver is a bit of

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,620
is a bit of a way to think about a DSL

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,350
to interact with the back-end service

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,339
I'm giving you a set of commands that

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,900
are written in this very specific

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,790
language and you will parse those

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,500
commands and you will do a thing for me

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,940
thank you for doing that thing for me

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,860
and of course there are many many ways

00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,080
to implement domain-specific languages

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,180
but most of the time what they do is

00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,250
they drive an API it's really just a

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,990
smart wrapper around the API generally a

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,339
super-smart wrapper because it's meant

00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:10,800
to be a mechanism by which less skilled

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,290
people can actually use you're probably

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,350
incredibly complicated API there's

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,780
nothing on the third point now there are

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,570
ways to fix this problem there are

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,880
mechanisms by which you can improve the

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,410
way that your API works or the world I'm

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,530
not going to tell you that I know all of

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,880
them but these are definitely some of

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,310
them like I said this is the cheap seats

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,790
so one of the ways that you can improve

00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,330
an API is by documenting your API

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,970
better if anybody in here has not worked

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,790
with an API recently that they went this

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,620
documentation blows if you have not

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,700
worked with at least one recently then

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,460
you probably have a pretty homogeneous

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,500
environment that you've had for a while

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,630
because at some point along the way

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,730
you'll be like don't they don't they did

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,070
it what the heck well how many how I use

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,980
this internet internet internet internet

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,180
huh that's all the documentation there

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:09,380
is huh javadocs awesome auto-generated

00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:12,500
javadoc super awesome yeah well at least

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,780
it tells me the 400 methods I might call

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,450
on this factory object how do i get the

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,330
factory object don't do well that says

00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,760
factory so maybe I call sums you know

00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:26,960
static method on oh no that's not what

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,570
happens hmm yeah the factory factory or

00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,280
or better yet you just go right you

00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,230
about go by the author's book which was

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,360
really the mechanism here right there's

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,160
a whole the whole idea was to drive you

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,700
toward purchasing a piece of a piece of

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,430
documentation that part I'm totally cool

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:46,430
with if you write an awesome book about

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:50,000
your crappily documented API well I'll

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,220
feel angry but I'll get what I want it's

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,420
least you've done good documentation if

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:59,240
you version your API well then as I said

00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,700
yesterday you're not an but if

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:07,280
you don't you're kind of an and

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,500
you need a way to deter people to

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:16,290
determine what your versions mean what

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:21,190
is the version after one dot 50 no

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:25,270
we might be yeah unless its job and then

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,770
it's five or six sorry but anyway but

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,080
you don't know what the version after

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,270
one dot five is because the version out

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,640
through after one dot five neat the

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,470
version needs to mean something you need

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,360
to have some meaning behind that version

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,050
it needs I need to be able to look at

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,880
your software you know a piece of code x

00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:47,470
version 5 41 and I a and by my

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,660
definition of the way good versioning

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,600
works if you have five dot for if I'm

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,030
using 541 I ought to be able to use five

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,700
dot 42 and not even think about it and

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,100
five dot for dot 74 and not even think

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,820
about it and I might have to think a

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,560
little bit about using five dot 50 I

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:09,220
really shouldn't have to and I really

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,550
just shouldn't even consider 600 because

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:15,100
you've told me by my rules of versioning

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,590
that you're no longer compatible with

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,500
the one I've been using and if you don't

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,180
do that then you just pulled a number

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,770
out of your nether regions and slapped

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,690
it on the end of your application and

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:30,760
said this is version wind up for that

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:33,880
762 well that was the one after 761 by

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,980
the way but you just it's randa at a

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,350
random number effectively speaking it's

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,390
a random but increasing number so the

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:46,330
very least I can generally guess that

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:51,040
one dot for dot 762 is after 761 but is

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:52,660
it after one dot five dot one mm-hmm how

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,430
would I know you might have been

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,430
releasing two branches at the same time

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,960
composition of your API especially with

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,850
a library is a huge deal now I'll talk

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:12,610
more about this when we get down to that

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:16,750
but examples of how your API works kiss

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:19,470
my ass hello world who has ever written

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:24,930
real software with a hello world example

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,930
ever Rios topics Richard

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,629
okay I probably believe you might have

00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,970
actually but when you when you get

00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:36,450
something complex and somebody gives you

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,610
this sort of superficial use case that

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,370
is that takes you three minutes to get

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,960
underway yeah okay I get it you have to

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,049
show me what how to get it all cranked

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,460
up but then if you're out let's say for

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:52,200
instance we're talking about Oh off

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,590
again I'm sorry guys sorry but let's say

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,710
we're talking about that the the base

00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:02,009
example for OAuth works just fine and

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,869
the second example works just fine but

00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:09,019
when you try to hire it into your

00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:11,639
software things get a little tougher now

00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,799
for documentation we know you hate

00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:16,860
writing documentation everybody hates

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:19,559
writing documentation except for people

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,779
who are writers my girlfriend is a

00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,509
writer and she hates writing

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,659
documentation but people who write for a

00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:30,320
living generally go au cours de de de

00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:32,820
and all the rest of us are like dude

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,879
documentation I work with some people

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,740
not right now who used the agile process

00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:43,049
as I would call it a reason not to write

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:48,240
documentation we're agile we don't have

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:51,240
to write documentation huh okay you're

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,059
you oh I get you sure you keep writing

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,590
the check dog but that doesn't

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,259
necessarily mean I agree with them but

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,049
if you're active application doesn't

00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:04,919
require documentation it's probably

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:07,289
pretty lame or it's so awesome that it

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,629
does everything for you by thinking for

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,009
you and if you have either one of those

00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:13,529
things you don't really belong in this

00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:17,399
conversation and I'm wish I was you sort

00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:19,710
of versioning work yeah I already did

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:22,529
this versions help you understand

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,600
compatibility version you need to use

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:27,720
some comprehensible versioning scheme

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,190
and you tell people what it is you

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,110
really do you need to tell people what

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,460
your versioning scheme really means it

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,679
doesn't have to be the one I like

00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,789
although the one I like is

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,360
mathematically superior to all other

00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,960
ones

00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,690
but you don't have to use mine just tell

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,280
me how yours works oh you don't know how

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,010
to make yours work stop making shut up

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,380
it's not cool when you when you make

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,290
stuff up like that I get I start

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,910
trusting you less and I don't know you I

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,100
downloaded your software from the

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,500
internet as far as I know you're a

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,290
hacker attempting to acquire all my

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,040
stuff and I don't want to have to trust

00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:08,910
you anymore then then then I really that

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:14,690
I'm required to I think I'm done with

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:16,950
that all right back to composition this

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,650
okay there's couple bad ways to do

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,350
composition you make a few calls and get

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,990
a few factories you perform some really

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,669
kinky stuff with those factories you do

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,140
you know you reach around your back

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,880
you're trying to scratch your left side

00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,010
with your right hand that kind of thing

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,929
that's a form of composition I go get a

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:38,010
thing I get a thing from that thing and

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:41,669
I kind of compose my run through your

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,980
API by means of the mechanisms you have

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,720
provided for me who writes their

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:51,419
software this way by the way I do too

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,179
sometimes so yeah we do this is why I

00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:56,250
hate developers but ok I'll go with that

00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:58,140
yeah a Java developers actually Java

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,720
developers have had a pretty bad rap in

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,750
this area because for a long time Java

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,010
developers didn't understand this one

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,600
really simple trick that makes

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,910
composition super easy which is

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,760
returning self to almost all your stuff

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,910
so that somebody can call call call call

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,250
call when I have to write 14 calls to

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:19,380
your applique to your API and I have to

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,910
get a result to each one and then do

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,540
something to it to get the next call

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,280
that's super annoying well do what

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,980
happens for me as I get lost when your

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,809
when your API requires me to wander down

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,410
the yellow brick road and never make it

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:37,230
to the Emerald City now there is a less

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,630
bad way which is basically that you're

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,880
you define the end results for what you

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,000
want for the for the business

00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,300
proposition for your software now your

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,430
software might be

00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,900
you might be playing video games or

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,870
whatever that's still your business

00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,870
proposition defining the result you want

00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:58,480
your software to provide and then giving

00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,240
somebody the shortest route to that

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,240
software to that piece of the code that

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,590
does the thing that they want done

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,370
getting them to your business

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,840
proposition as fast as possible is

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,960
substantially less painful than the

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:19,060
standard you know 17 factories and and

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:22,120
44 calls mechanism and I still want to

00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:25,840
be able to walk the very detailed path

00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:27,430
when you do that I want if it was if

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,550
this is a question about about a

00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,260
particular behavior that required 50

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,260
steps of orchestration in the back end

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,510
I'll be happy to front-load a huge call

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,210
if you need 50 pieces of data from me

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:43,330
knock it out I will give you all of them

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,190
if i can give you all of them and you

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,930
immediately give me my result back I

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,930
don't care what happens back there I

00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,060
mean I do but I don't care as long as I

00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,670
can get I can do the thing as simply as

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,590
it can be done now do I want to walk

00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,750
down the list that inquires each one of

00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,910
those 50 things and does all the steps

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,890
in the back end I probably don't want to

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:05,590
but eventually I'm going to have a use

00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:08,650
case that requires that I do that I have

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:10,570
a I have a weird use case that requires

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,010
that I skip a step or add another step

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,960
or do something else in the middle or

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,810
use some piece of information that you

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,450
give me to do to make a decision but

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,270
usually there are a number of places in

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,450
our number of application ap is that

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:28,210
provide only the steps not the end

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,630
result obviously they give you something

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,940
because people still use them but they

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,970
don't give you the thing in a tidy

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,700
package i am not saying that you

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,500
shouldn't have to work for a living i do

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,870
not mean that i do not mean that

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,230
somebody else should give you everything

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,850
that you want on a plate I'm just saying

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,610
that it's super nice when they do and

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,490
that if they have the ability to do it

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:56,590
and they're there by definition probably

00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,590
better at giving you their result than

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:03,210
you are at getting it from them

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:06,419
then it seems reasonable to ask them to

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,559
go a little further now in the open

00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:09,539
source world it's kind of hard to talk

00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,549
people into going a little further it

00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,929
kind of is not impossible but it's kind

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,299
of hard it's like they don't get paid

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:18,120
for this you know here's here's all the

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,710
steps knock yourself out I get that I'm

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,960
not saying that I'm not telling you to

00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,279
go back and you know rebuild

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,200
orchestration around your very

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,820
complicated API that you had to

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,029
meticulously pick out over five years

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,350
worth of work but now you you've

00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,470
actually increased the pain in the world

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,419
a little bit by asking people to use it

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,659
that doesn't make you a bad person but

00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,940
you could have been a better person now

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:44,789
at the example stuff I know you have

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,950
examples in your in your API for your AP

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:49,140
I know you do everybody does your a

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,490
little bit of documentation if for

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,919
nothing else then for the guy that you

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,090
that came along next to you and said hey

00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,309
I want to work on this with you it

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,230
awesome here's how you do it you know

00:27:56,309 --> 00:28:00,659
maybe it's eleven lines of text you've

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,429
got examples but your examples are of

00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,970
the hello world of your product almost

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:10,850
always they rarely dive into the depths

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:13,980
of the application I like a tool that

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,770
was purchased by Red Hat several years

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,250
ago called fuse does anybody know that

00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:23,460
is listen it's an osgi container and

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,169
activemq server and camel routing and

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,679
all kinds of cool cool stuff in the back

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:31,380
end I really like this tool I really

00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,480
like this tool because I like osgi I

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,399
know she has a giant pain in the butt

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,210
but I really like the way this Tool

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:40,679
Works and I have had an enormous amount

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,860
of trouble getting this tool to work

00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,110
correctly because that all the examples

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,789
for this tool that were available on the

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,450
interwebs when I was starting to use it

00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:54,000
worked like a champ you could you know

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,580
hack together an osgi bundle and throw

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,309
it into the into the Felix or carafe

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:01,169
whichever one you were using and crank

00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:03,179
it up and it would show you examples I

00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:06,840
actually even did it I did a two hour

00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,179
demo on using the thing by hugging the

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,210
examples that I had and they did real

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:14,030
work but that's about as far as I

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,980
really ever get with it most of the time

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,690
not anymore I'm I've spit I've put a

00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,330
little time into it but in the beginning

00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:23,490
it was terrible and I couldn't really

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,970
get a lot of help with that because the

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,220
developer list was less than completely

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,540
responsive and the user list was not

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,140
responsive at all under most

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,810
circumstances and my and my problem was

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,960
substantial because I was trying to do a

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:43,590
bunch of big work on using this tool

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,780
that I knew it would do now that they

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,430
had lots of the hello world examples but

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,030
they didn't tell me how to actually

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:53,970
build the how to dive all the way down

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,560
and build the pieces at the bottom of

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,470
the chain that I really needed to use

00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,150
they do now now that they charge a

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,980
jillion dollars to people to consult

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,210
from Red Hat and I'm cool with that

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,130
that's that's a great way to make money

00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,190
it really is but I really would have

00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:10,470
liked to been more of a I'd like to bend

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,030
more of an evangelist for them because I

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,340
know they have an awesome product they

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:18,020
just kind of lacked at the example level

00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:21,300
give me real stuff that does real work

00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:23,850
don't do it all for me I mean you don't

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,950
know my use case really but make your

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,770
use case at least to be encompassing of

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,160
a number of a variety of situations ones

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:35,040
that solve real real real problems go

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,390
you know read data whatever it is you

00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,270
know whatever your thing is whatever the

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,190
thing you might be able to produce is

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:44,370
divided you know divide your results in

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:46,500
two examples that are for people who are

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,660
not good at stuff and for people who are

00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,200
good at stuff give graduate the results

00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,970
build on your documentation this way

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,130
then you get to have something that

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,050
looks a little bit more like this people

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,120
can see through what their can see

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,030
outside of what their life looks like

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:08,750
into what you want them to see the thing

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:10,669
that they're looking for any questions

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,299
comments

00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:16,399
I told you is going to go kind of fast

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:18,139
about that so if you divide if you add

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,899
up both of my presentations it was

00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:31,999
really only 45 minutes peas okay no

00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:35,359
questions good but rammell oh yeah I've

00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:37,399
heard of this yeah yeah okay um so there

00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,809
is a mechanism for i didn't i didn't

00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,669
actually include this because i was i

00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:43,369
couldn't remember the name of it there

00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,499
are tools that let you do documentation

00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:48,820
on your api and even publish them into

00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:51,889
in public places but those tools are

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:55,879
themselves things that you have to learn

00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:58,460
how to use in my world that tool should

00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:00,470
come with like a babysitter there's

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,720
yummy like you can find me a dude like

00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,389
that you should really kind of pull

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,549
everybody into the fold on that one they

00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:10,399
have a have a building system around

00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:12,559
which people who become capable of day

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,200
of documenting their api's correctly I

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,590
am NOT that guy i don't i'm not a people

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,139
person but i like the idea that there

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,720
are people persons in the world who are

00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:35,889
capable of disseminating that kind of

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:35,889
that kind of behavior yes sure

00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:58,070
soccer no I i I'm I'm willing to take

00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,590
them by the way if you have them I am

00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,660
told if you think yours is awesome like

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,190
I have to say this I mean I'm like I'm

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,260
not really kiss rich I like her a lot

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,910
I'm not kissing zap is coach actually

00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,520
got a pretty good API to it cuz it's

00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:13,970
super simple I mean it does the one

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,490
thing is supposed to do who you got to

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:29,030
Leo actually you're right Tulio does

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:32,120
have a really good API they do right so

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:35,630
i will say this i actually really like

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,980
the documentation forget i'm not i once

00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:41,809
again i've said this before i'm not a

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:45,290
get guile like it it's just the one

00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,790
everybody uses and the one that pretty

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,730
much people are going to continue to use

00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:52,250
it does all the stuff it really does

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,260
work and their api for the way you

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,799
interface to get is incredibly

00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:59,809
complicated but it's graduated you can

00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,559
actually start at the crappy end and

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:05,360
walk your way up you can do this it's

00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:08,540
the same for fossil i actually use

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,720
fossil for a project a few months ago I

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,320
mean I I Richard Wright fossil too by

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:17,210
the way but fossil is a is a

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,159
decentralized source code control system

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,659
as well that happens to use SQL light in

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,500
this back-end I know that's a huge shock

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,980
for everybody but it actually works a

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,379
lot it works very well and having you

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,600
know having it having constraints on

00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:35,359
what you're willing to do not trying to

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,500
shotgun the problem actually helps that

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,500
an awful lot yes sir

00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:52,799
sequel alchemy I don't necessarily agree

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,839
with that but i but i do like I like

00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,549
sequel out I use sequel alchemy an awful

00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,109
lot but I don't know if I remember

00:34:56,549 --> 00:35:00,180
whether or not it was easy to learn

00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:04,170
because i've been using it at ultimate

00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:07,170
hmm there is a lot of documentation for

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,450
it yes there are and they actually there

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,049
are not just examples the best thing

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:17,599
about most open source AP is is not the

00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:17,599
documentation that you get with the tool

00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,670
well yeah that's helpful but the but the

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,770
fact that you can actually go to other

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,319
projects that are open source projects

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,930
that are using that code and steal their

00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:32,250
codes i deceive know y'all got y'all

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,799
never do that yellow a smart you make

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,809
your stuff off by by hand but i totally

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,549
cannibalize everything I've ever seen in

00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:40,410
the world I'm not sure if ever written

00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:42,990
an original line of code or not because

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,640
I look but I'm Matt fact that's how

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,190
actually how I learned you seek alchemy

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,020
is not necessarily i'm pretty sure it

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,059
wasn't sitting down and hacking through

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,920
the documentation I think I found the

00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:54,660
book for it well there was a there was a

00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,619
book for it but I got a book for it like

00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:00,569
way later so it was I went and hacked up

00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,180
applications that use sequel alchemy

00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:04,470
internally and was like how does oh I

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,329
don't know how this application works

00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,099
but here's the part where they're doing

00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:11,880
the they're getting the cursor for ok I

00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:14,670
got it now so that sort of thing is is

00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,160
how i do this to again to answer your

00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,200
question no I really don't i don't have

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,599
things that i would pony up and say this

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,910
is the way to do it but i'm not going to

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,670
do that anyway I mean I know I kicked

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,630
around Oh awful lot but the truth is

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:33,779
that Oh auth is is kind of a

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:37,170
comprehensive authorization and identity

00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:40,049
management holder it really is you could

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,690
make it do more stuff you could make it

00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:44,789
do it easier but it does pretty much

00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,819
everything that it sets out to do but

00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:49,440
it's super complicated and if you have a

00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:50,960
super complicated problem you probably

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,109
do have a super complicated ap

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,330
but what I think we miss in software

00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:57,800
development is not the fact that you

00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,270
have a super complicated problem that

00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,760
you're trying to solve but that not

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:04,460
everybody's iteration of that problem

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,160
needs to have the access to all the

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,710
things to all the stuff you're going to

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,099
do I didn't start I didn't start writing

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,810
Java by cracking open the the networking

00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:16,310
code I just well I guess they're really

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,830
technically wasn't networking code then

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,050
but I didn't chart writing writing Java

00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,780
by right cracking open the new network

00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,599
libraries I I understood pieces of it

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,160
very very slowly and maybe you're

00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,770
smarter than me well probably you're

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,750
smarter than me but the truth is that I

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:36,589
think lots of people work really well

00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:40,040
when you can give them success at lower

00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:43,430
levels and graduate that success into

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:51,280
more complex complex compositions of

00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:51,280
success bales awesome thanks for time

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,960
your customers rely on your website or

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,329
application if it's slower

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,270
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:38,099
and costs you money keeping your

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,630
business critical systems humming along

00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,910
requires insight into what they're doing

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,890
your system metrics tells stories

00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,869
stories that can reveal performance

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,210
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:51,769
other problems but how do you keep an

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,440
eye on all of your systems performance

00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:57,440
metrics in real-time and record this

00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,210
data for later analysis enter longview

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,250
the new way to see what's really going

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,380
on under the hood the long view

00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,450
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,910
of all your systems providing you with a

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:11,299
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:13,880
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:15,619
load and network usage click a specific

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,019
system to access its individual

00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:20,529
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:22,940
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:24,619
comprehensive network data including

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,930
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:28,490
available on the network tab and disk

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,410
rights and free space on the disk

00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,259
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,779
displays usage statistics for individual

00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:37,970
processes the system info tab shows

00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:40,190
listening services active connections

00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:42,349
and available updates adding long view

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,029
to a system is easy just click the

00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:46,190
button copy the one line installation

00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:48,619
command then run the command on your

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,329
linux system to complete the process the

00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,519
agent will begin collecting data and

00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,330
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,910
start rolling

00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:59,280
used longview to gain visibility into

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:03,020
your servers so when your website or app

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,020
