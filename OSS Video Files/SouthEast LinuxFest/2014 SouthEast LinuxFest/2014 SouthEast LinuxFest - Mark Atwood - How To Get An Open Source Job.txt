half hour drive the i-85 exists in the

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,450

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,530
how to get one of those awesome

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,690
open-source jobs my name is Mark Atwood

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,730
and I work for hewlett-packard and I

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,710
have a fancy title that I help make up

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,410
myself on the director of open-source

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,030
engagement I work with the group inside

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,909
hewlett-packard called the open source

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,000
programs office you can see here on the

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,920
slide my email address I'm going to make

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,260
a point of that several times it's very

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,210
easy to find me online but via my email

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,700
address and I don't keep it hidden open

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,369
HP is involved with a bunch of different

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,990
open source projects where heavily

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,900
involved in Linux Foundation and the

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,850
next project in general we are kind of

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,610
famously very heavily involved right now

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,409
in the openstack cloud computing project

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,530
and a bunch of other open source

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,560
projects I personally been involved in

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,899
open source since i first read Richard

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,030
Stallman manifesto and dr. dodge dr.

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,780
dobb's journal in the mid-80s anyone

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,320
else remember reading that anybody oh my

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,320
gray hairs

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,960
hewlett-packard is hiring however I

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,870
cannot juice your application into the

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,240
company happiness and success and jobs

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,180
and careers are not guaranteed nor they

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,310
specifically linked to each other and

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,720
this talk is a syllabus not a textbook

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,520
I'm not going to teach you what you need

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,990
to know I'm going to tell you some of

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,470
the things you need to go look up and

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,420
learn yourself and then the final

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,890
proverb for this slide is life is what

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,540
will happen well you make other plans

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:28,080
but make other plans anyway the open

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,240
source job I love my job it's kind of

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,550
living the dream and what's even better

00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,550
for me is it's not exclusive to me other

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,060
people can live this dream too first of

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,030
all it's a job pays a salary there's a

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,700
career pays my bills it can support a

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,800
family it has hard work it's got

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,620
frustrations there's corporate elements

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,750
people who do open source as sole

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,570
proprietors or individually or students

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,000
or in giant company like I am you have

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,290
to deal with all of that stuff but you

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,080
have to deal with it for a regular job

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,060
anyway and this is much better I think

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,910
than most regular proprietary software

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,160
jobs they're a bunch of really awesome

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,739
intangible benefits and we keep selling

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,070
this kind of job your skills will be in

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,170
demand and will be more portable by

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,120
portable that means is you're working on

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,090
a project that you enjoy with the people

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,550
you enjoy the technologies you decide to

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,660
learn yourself can last longer than any

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,769
one company anyone tour of employment

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,019
you'll feel better about your work

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,290
you'll feel better about its impact on

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,060
the world and you end to repeat

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,920
something I said before you will be less

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,810
subject to corporate women's you'll be

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,610
less objective restructuring layoffs

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,830
right-sizing business failures for

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,890
regular technology developments and tech

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,380
and um engineers when your employer

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,319
makes a business mistake or the market

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,030
changes

00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,310
and your company makes a financial

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,499
crater in the landscape the executives

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,150
and the salesmen can go exact can sell

00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:03,730
other things for the companies and you

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,849
have to start from scratch when you work

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,499
an open source when whoever is paying

00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,689
your paycheck changes you can keep

00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:15,040
working on the same thing and they have

00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:16,539
to go restart from scratch I love

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,220
telling that to executives the

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:22,210
proprietary software companies because

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,770
they start getting really nervous the

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,990
other thing awesome about this kind of

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,870
job is it tends towards distributed work

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,310
is working from home or if you work for

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,169
an office you work in teams that are

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,479
spread across the country and around the

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,370
world means when you get involved in

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,470
open source and you want to really get

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,849
involved in high-performance soft

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,460
development you probably don't have to

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:45,370
move to Atlanta or New York or San

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,750
Francisco they're awesome cities this

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:53,259
also makes it easier to move there if

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,060
you want to if you want to so I'm going

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,070
to go over some of the skills you need

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,500
to have to get this kind of job to work

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,169
in open source software developments the

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,780
first one is your communication skills

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,130
you need to learn how to speak you need

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,870
to learn how to speak in meetings around

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,900
a table you need to learn how to speak

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,130
behind a podium like this you need to

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,509
speak learn how to speak when you're

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,960
standing on a carpet in front of an

00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,729
executive desk you need to learn how to

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,099
write you've probably heard all this

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,199
before and I'm just repeating it again

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:25,030
you have to be able to write clearly the

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,750
most important programming language you

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,250
will ever learn is English you have to

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,300
be reachable you have to have a public

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,949
email address I've had some people ask

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,840
me about this it does not mean that you

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:39,400
need to make this goes back to the talk

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
that we just heard this does not mean

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,330
you need to have your life discoverable

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,729
you don't need to be able to don't need

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,219
to have your kids pictures available

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,960
online anything like that you just need

00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,529
to be reachable by email address it's

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,799
easy to link to you

00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:59,289
and finally in communication skills yes

00:05:54,799 --> 00:06:03,069
a hand up mic over to the hand when you

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:07,549
right now just a curiosity is that like

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:12,829
like writing company reports or is that

00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:16,129
just I generalized work-related writing

00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:18,949
so when you say writing speaking how

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,719
detailed is that supposed to go see the

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,399
question was is what kind of writing

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:25,569
what kind of speaking is it just work

00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,099
related at the very least it needs to be

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:31,249
in some business writing in business

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:33,589
speaking but beyond that as well a lot

00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:37,129
of what's awesome and difficulty an open

00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,779
source job is it blurs much of your

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,969
personal life hobby life and business

00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:43,579
life together so you have to be able to

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:45,619
speak and write even when you're not at

00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:47,149
an office not in a business setting when

00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:49,459
you're writing blog entries when you're

00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:52,579
talking on social media when you're

00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:55,699
writing documentation when you're is any

00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:58,069
of those sorts of venues whether at work

00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,649
or before you start working you have to

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,999
be able to speak and write clearly and

00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,669
also between jobs as you move from

00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:06,679
employer to employer it's also just a

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:10,959
really good set of skills to have for

00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:13,489
Rick for having an ordinary awesome life

00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,289
the final critical important point in

00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,789
communication skills which I'm going to

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,399
feed over and over again is don't be a

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:22,429
jerk your reputation is hard to change

00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,039
and as was loaded to in the previous

00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:27,139
talk the internet is kind of forever the

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,989
way you communicate online sticks around

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,369
for a very long time it's some every

00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:33,019
time you write something to kind of have

00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:34,849
to keep in mind someone's going to read

00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:38,749
this in 15 years when they decide what

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:41,899
they want to work with you or not the

00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:43,759
technical skills you need are obvious

00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:47,839
importance but which ones are some

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,869
sometimes not as apparent probably most

00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:54,529
people here know how to program but if

00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:56,929
you don't i recommend you learn how if

00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,729
you want a basics where'd which ones do

00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:00,889
i start color which programming language

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,260
do i start with i recommend Python or

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,390
Java Script

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,580
javascript is very definitely not my

00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,680
favorite programming language but the

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,920
thing is everywhere and it's kind of

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,870
kind of hard to overcome that I've had

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,030
some people asked me say Dom I'm in a

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,740
class right now and I'm learning ruby or

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,260
i'm running a c-sharp should i stop and

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,950
go back and what and start taking python

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,530
classes no just keep its those are some

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,390
suggestions but ruby and c-sharp are

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,640
perfectly good things to start with as

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:34,750
well but don't start with those

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:38,680
programming languages Scala Erlang auto

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,020
tool C and C++ golang learn a new

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,210
programming language every six months to

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,600
a year just enough to play with it at

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:48,430
least learn how to use a debugger it's

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,750
all the programmers I've met who know

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,240
how to write code but don't know how to

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,190
run a debugger you will spend more of

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,900
your life writing some and software

00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,150
development fixing bugs your own bugs

00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:02,230
will be running new green code learn you

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:06,120
learn learn to use your debugger print

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,120
statements are not a debugger by the way

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:15,580
nope learn how to use git and github I'm

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,560
being kind of specific there it's get

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,420
will not always be the distributed

00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,280
version control system choice but right

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,070
now it is since that's the one you kind

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,250
of have to learn and github is not

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,980
necessarily the code repository for

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,780
whatever project code repository hosting

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,640
service it will be for the whatever

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,210
projects you use but it's the one that

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,390
most of them use right now then by learn

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,280
how to use them there is both a

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,740
technical and a social aspect to them

00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,720
it's distributed source control is

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,830
awesome and difficult because it is so

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,460
much more than just check-in check-out

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,230
merge its learn how to use more advanced

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,240
features if you co work with people

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:58,210
start pulling patches back and forth

00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,860
merging projects together the more you

00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,279
learn about how these things work more

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,800
blown away you will be

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,660
more or you'll wish we had these things

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,329
in the 80s 70s the final one is kind of

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,899
weird here is learn how to write to test

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:16,850
this is kind of new designed to test and

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,819
use continuous integration see if any

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,870
the project you're involved in are using

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:25,040
Jenkins or if you're really lucky

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,800
Jenkins and Garrett together 15 years

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,480
ago lot most developers only about half

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,860
of developers not commercial settings

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,569
we're using source control now nearly

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,540
all of us are using insurance control I

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:37,309
would say right now less than a tenth of

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,809
us in the open source world or using

00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:42,110
continuous integration but that's

00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:43,490
changing quickly once you start using it

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,350
you will never want to write any of your

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:52,730
own software without it again it is

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:54,649
really astounding that's true Travis is

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,879
this point is Travis is also a good one

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:01,790
I should probably accentuate Travis over

00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,670
Jenkins because getting github right now

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,309
kind of encourage you to use Travis CI

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,740
whereas I came into the CI world using

00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,660
them in some Jenkins on the drizzle

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,750
project now on OpenStack whatever

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,149
whichever one you use Garrett or Jenkins

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,279
start using one and you'll be blown away

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:25,490
how much better your code will get yes

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:27,949
question here Garrett GE r RI t it's um

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:30,649
it's a automated code review system

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,120
developed by the Android project and is

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,439
used by Google and now a bunch of other

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,059
projects Garrett allows you to do

00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,500
distributed code reviews you don't have

00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,300
to have your code review or sitting on

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,730
the young city it to the best next to

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:48,620
you we all like playing with the

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,929
computers but it turns out there's all

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,990
these cool awesome people out there as

00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,029
well one of the things I love about

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,810
working an open source is the

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,940
relationships and the friendships

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,860
adventures with my friends that I have

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:09,410
had and if with the friends that I have

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:12,170
made you need to meet people find local

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,210
people come to conferences like this at

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,080
their local go to meet ups go to

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,640
hackerspaces find people in the schools

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,620
also you need to find remote people to

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,200
work with because boniva the work remote

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,790
is a skill you need and there are more

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,880
smart people in the rest of the world

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,460
and there isn't anyone given City I give

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,570
this talk in San Francisco and sometimes

00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:39,020
don't believe me but that San Francisco

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:42,380
so San Francisco to find remote people

00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,240
again conferences like this the internet

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,279
we have built a two trillion dollar

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,110
machine at a significant fraction the

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,170
world's gross planetary product so that

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,880
we can talk to each other let's use it

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,470
and then any of the projects you get

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,120
involved in will probably have people

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,270
spread around the world learn how to

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,760
work with them again I can repeat don't

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,820
be a jerk don't burn bridges the world

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,010
is very small as you go through your

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,600
career is them and as you've been going

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,380
through you're noticing you keep running

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,940
into the same people over and over again

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,190
there is a thesis that there are only

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:19,880
200 people in the world the rest of our

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:21,020
non player characters it's it and I

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,220
think that's true it's just that

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,380
everyone disagrees on who the 200 are so

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,940
but again don't be a jerk don't be that

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,970
guy that someone doesn't want to work

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,770
with now here's the catch you have to

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,700
start doing the work before you get the

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,530
job you have to find the projects that

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,420
interest you you have to start getting

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,450
involved in them you have to demonstrate

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,570
your credibility in your skills and then

00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,480
the pain work will come to you and the

00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,730
way you get involved is you find the

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,860
projects that interest you you start

00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,390
fixing bugs merging them upstream and

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,000
you're doing this for a couple of

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,300
different reasons you're increasing your

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,310
skill in that programming language

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,440
increasing your skill and knowledge of

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,350
that project hopefully you picked a

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,540
project that other people are using and

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,820
you're also learning the development

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,770
process for that project every project

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,570
is a little bit different one of the

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,940
cool things that github has done is it

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,250
cut in addition to providing a git

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,500
repository for everybody everything it

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,900
has kind of a baked in development

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,180
process that so lots of new projects use

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,130
it but not every project uses that and

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,920
different projects have different ways

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:37,630
of communicating with your peers with

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,430
pushing things upstream with what's the

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,090
right way to write a pull request learn

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,890
the one for the project you're in answer

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,650
questions online one of my favorite

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,990
sites and stack overflow there's a whole

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,240
bunch of different ask type sites Ascot

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,270
OpenStack org was made up just for the

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,850
OpenStack project get involved in those

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,650
kinds of Q&A sites start following

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,700
questions and when your skill you're

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:05,050
comfortable in your skills your

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:07,000
knowledge start answering questions take

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,930
on larger and larger roles as your

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,470
skills and your credibility grill

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,660
collaboration tools who uses IRC most of

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,000
you good other projects use other

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,730
systems but IRC is the default learn how

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,710
to use IRC learn how to use your

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,570
projects bug tracker learn how to

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,700
collaborate with get that's repeating

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,070
myself again it's distributed source

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,810
control is half technology and half

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:36,760
social tools and then another one that's

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,180
kind of new to people is learn how to do

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,950
stretch code review and pair programming

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,630
if you are really smart and if you've

00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,890
been a really good solo developer up at

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,360
this point this is going to be very

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,030
uncomfortable and you're not going to

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,360
like it at all do it anyway it's really

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,360
amazing

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,830
for your reputation you're doing two

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,510
things you're growing your skills and

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,110
you're showing you have the skills that

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,120
you have grown the distinction here I

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:07,750
like to draw is your portfolio versus

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,700
your resume we all have a resume we

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,680
presumably all keep it reasonably up to

00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,420
date but the resume is just something

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,550
that you tell a prospective employer oh

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,940
I know this I know this I know this and

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,500
they have to they have to at least

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,120
believe you enough to bring you in for a

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,190
technical interview and maybe dive in

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,980
whereas if you have a portfolio if you

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:30,220
have a list of projects on github or on

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:33,520
launch pad or wherever the employers can

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,190
look at what you've done it's artists

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,890
and public speakers and performers and

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,990
stuff them and even professors and

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,200
academics don't do resumes they do

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,940
portfolios or CDs and it makes so much

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,890
more sense for software developers as

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:53,040
well to do portfolios instead of resumes

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,540
your Linkedin your social media stuff

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,370
lots of companies now they look at your

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,170
resume along just long enough to make

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,940
sure it matches roughly up with your

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,160
LinkedIn you're Xing profile and they

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,209
use that instead this becomes less

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,589
important when you're at the upper

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,770
echelon but when you're just starting

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:12,490
out or a junior dev you need to keep

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,040
that stuff up to date and again have

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,390
contact information on your resume and

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,870
on your

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,530
linkedin how to get how a recruiter or a

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:24,030
employer can get hold of you this is all

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,950
this background stuff the things you

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,740
need to get ready to get the job how do

00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,870
you find the job opening nearly every

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,520
from successful project or drawing

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,340
project has at least one company

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,110
attached to it the company is chef unit

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,100
or the company is just hiring people who

there and also you come to conferences

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:14,880
like this and come to talks like this

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:17,910
that end with we're hiring now the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,410
process of doing the interview and of

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,240
evaluating the company do you actually

00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,800
want to work here is the project

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,240
actually good for you that sort of thing

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,790
I'm not going to go through this here

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,960
that would be too long talks of their

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,790
own but once you've gone through the

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,020
interviews once you've decided you're

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,840
going to take the job congratulations

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,100
you've got the job I'm going to talk now

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,170
a little bit about some of the things

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,850
immediately afterwards because in

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,590
addition to get the awesome open source

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:48,450
job you want to have that awesome open

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:51,300
source career and so step one counter

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,500
offer so who here has ever countered

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:58,160
offered a job offer now I'm seeing

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,540
something really kind of amazing here

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
it's still highly gender link but I

00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,660
actually saw a woman raise your hand

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,430
congratulations I'm convinced that a not

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,840
insignificant part of the wage gap

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,640
between men and when

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,850
that women don't counter offer their job

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,380
offers once a company has given you a

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:20,190
job offer they've decided they want you

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,740
now your dickering over price and if you

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,510
even worse case and you ask for ten

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,820
percent more and they say no you're not

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,470
out anything but now they also have in

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,789
their mind you may be worth ten percent

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,380
more you have it in your mind you're

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:34,710
worth ten percent more or fifteen

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,059
percent more make that counter offer if

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,799
they don't want to give you more money

00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,110
maybe you can ask for three weeks of

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,210
vacation to the two or you baked into

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,100
your contract that you have a particular

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,630
week off or that they're going to send

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,710
you to so many conferences something

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,110
another important thing to keep in mind

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,020
especially as an open source developer

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,419
is your employment contract will

00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,279
probably have I called an appendix B

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,230
though it moves around it was an

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,720
appendix B when I got hired at MySQL

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,909
they're going to ask you to make a list

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,190
of what your existing intellectual

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,020
property and these are project these the

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,419
contributions you've already made to

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,000
existing projects or projects that you

00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:17,159
have already started you put that in

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,799
there sometimes it's called carve out

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,330
and then you read really carefully

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,980
through your employment contract who

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,279
owns that stuff and who owns your

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,809
contributions to it going forward and

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,640
this turns into what is the law in your

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,799
state what's the law in California

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,070
watching the contract but keep that

00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,960
stuff up to date and defend it it's

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,610
because again you are not just getting

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,409
an awesome open-source job you're

00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,270
getting awesome open-source career and

00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,830
it's not much of your career if when you

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:49,289
change jobs you have to leave everything

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:51,240
behind when you have that job and you're

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,520
having that career it is no fun if your

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,399
health sucks and we have the kind of job

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,899
where it really wreck our health in ways

00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:59,899
that we don't quite realize immediately

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,690
who can work an 80-hour work week

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,840
indefinitely anybody anyone nobody

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,049
nobody can there are probably two people

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,130
who can but they start companies instead

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,260
nobody can work 60 hours a week

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,210
continuously without burning out you can

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,880
work 60 hours a week for about two weeks

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,800
then you have to stop if you are working

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,080
80 hours a week and you have to work 80

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:29,250
hours a week you are either in a priest

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,440
a startup you are in a war zone and when

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:34,140
that is happening the number one job of

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,730
your thunder or your founder or your

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,180
commanding officer is to get your

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,500
workload down before you burn out and if

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,000
they're not doing it it's your number

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,650
one job to get your workload down

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,410
because you will design your helps

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:55,440
working 80 hours a week who knows what

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:59,310
geek neck is that will really suck after

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,130
a couple of decades don't do that whose

00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,350
wrists hurt today anybody somebody

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,090
surely somebody hears ritzer's they

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:12,300
don't grow back they don't so watch your

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:18,600
neck watch your wrists who here your

00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:20,070
legs junk food don't eat it ever who

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,690
here sort of quant the quantified self

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:27,360
movement it's on fit bix filth health

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,040
trackers that sort of thing write that

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,600
down start googling that I really

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,780
recommend you get involved in quantified

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,840
self and the final point on health is

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:39,480
jerks again but instead don't be a jerk

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,280
don't work for a jerk they're bad for

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,460
your career they're bad for your health

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,050
there's a cohort of technical executives

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,360
out there who think that they're a jerk

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,950
they are the next Steve Jobs and they

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,950
are not they're just jerks

00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,400
money one of our favorite or least

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:05,809
favorite topics who here is going to get

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,809
a pension he work for the state or

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:14,460
congratulations yeah I see yep yep

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,540
without even who here is going to be

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,500
able to live off of their social

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:26,190
security when they retire exactly max

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,020
out your 401 K in your IRA student loans

00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,240
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,020
it's hard to pay off even with the stem

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,100
degree borrow as little as you can paid

00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:40,410
off as fast as you can again the

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,440
counteroffer makes it goes a long way

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,540
here and thence people sometimes ask me

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,700
about options and stock grants and rs

00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,559
use and ESP peas and all that stuff and

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,929
I am NOT a financial advisor we should

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,340
go find one as soon as you have a job or

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:55,340
someone's offering you these things and

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,630
talk to them about what you should do

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:03,690
but don't kill yourself for a nickel a

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:07,679
nickel is five hundreds of 1% to the

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,410
company that's a nickel and there are

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,610
people who will think you're thirsty of

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:14,340
giving you the world when they're giving

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:17,100
you the nickel don't kill yourself for

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,929
that there are people in tech and tech

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,750
startups in the technology industry who

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,580
will strip mine you for your health and

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,840
your skills and throw you away when

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,890
they're done and they seem like the

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,290
nicest people ever but don't kill

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,240
yourself for that

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:34,250
all day they'll smile all day they'll

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,510
make you feel if you feel like the most

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,280
important person in the world they'll

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,720
ask you about your kids and they'll

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:44,330
sympathize with you when your wife is

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,250
sick and they're strip lighting you so

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,110
there's not too much of a startup scene

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,650
here in Charlotte but there are a few

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:54,890
and if you move to Atlanta or New York

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:56,510
or San Francisco that's all start up if

00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,150
you do that know what you're doing and

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,380
what you're getting into again take my

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,990
worrying about being stripped mind two

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,420
hearts do not take a pay cut unless you

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:10,370
have real equity real equity again is

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:12,800
not nicole and then finally keep

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,990
learning here's one of the things that

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,030
is the most important thing I wish I had

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,810
known when I was much younger skilled

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:24,500
beats smart skilled always beat smart

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:27,050
and you can get skilled and you can stay

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,400
skilled schedule time in your career to

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,870
your life for learning all those

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,770
programming languages i mentioned

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,780
ordering frameworks or learning new

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,580
approaches or learning life hacking on

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,860
quantified self or something but keep

00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,200
learning the tech always keeps changing

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,950
you stop changing in 18 months you're

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,840
going to be completely out of days but

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,010
it's really kind of fun isn't it this is

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,250
your life and then there are three books

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,080
which I recommend which um partially

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,460
informed this talk and by themselves are

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,440
just awesome on their own you've

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,990
probably heard of one or two I recommend

00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,900
all three of them oh the places you'll

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:09,680
go by the good doctor getting things

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:12,320
done and finally how to fail at almost

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,690
everything is still win big by the guy

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:20,240
who invented Dilbert thank you very much

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,890
again my name is mark at would mark

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,960
taught at what at hp.com and

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,370
hewlett-packard is hiring and we can

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,090
talk to me afterwards about sort of

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:39,620
things were higher

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:42,890
for thank you young yes question earlier

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,409
and you talked about programming earlier

00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:49,279
and i'm just wondering from a beginner's

00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:53,299
perspective what what would you say is

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,820
the greatest online tool not necessarily

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,380
going to classes but what is the

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,980
greatest online tool for learning

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,500
program and Khan Academy Khan Academy

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,110
it's um there there are probably other

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,460
ones that are that that may be better

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,309
but the one that I'm the most familiar

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,250
with it teaches basic programming to

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:15,049
adults and I'm young adults there's the

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,090
Khan Academy there they're famous for

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,179
teaching math they have an entire track

00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:23,210
for teaching programming in Python get

00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:25,279
some there are a bunch of other online

00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,929
resources some better than others hit

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,669
the internet and just sit and just type

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:31,190
in as the search learning python and

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,720
learning javascript and it'll start

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,620
giving you bunches of resources but I

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,240
would start with Khan any other question

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,640
not supposed to question is a comment

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,830
regarding the gentleman's question

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,429
earlier about the importance of writing

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:50,029
if you can tolerate a 120 second story

00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:52,159
sure I used to work for a company that

00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,679
used to be wonderful and powerful called

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,779
digital equipment corporation which

00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,669
became dog food I work for the same

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,409
company there you go since dec got

00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:02,059
blocked by compact and compact got

00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:05,950
bought by hewlett-packard and that was a

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:11,330
happy day when compact died on the

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:12,799
before my time while i was at deck i had

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,080
one of those wonderful contracts that

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,210
said that the dreams that came into my

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,010
head at night while i was laying on my

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,010
pillow belonged to the company

00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:25,139
that was the intellectual property

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,720
consideration however there was an

00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:29,519
interesting little loophole that said

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,980
but we like thought leaders so if you go

00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,409
out and write and speak will even give

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,499
you a small incentive as a reward for

00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:39,090
getting something published so when I

00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:41,249
got involved with open source I couldn't

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,370
actually write any software but I could

00:28:41,249 --> 00:28:45,929
shoot my mouth off and so I learned how

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,080
to shoot my mouth off on how to write

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:50,820
and so I started you know writing things

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,909
for a Linux Gazette the linux journal

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,119
few other things ended up writing a book

00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:59,460
while I was at compacts what is your

00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:05,970
name Russ pavlicek I've read a bunch of

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:08,850
your stuff thank you and so I wrote all

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,330
these things and then the inevitable in

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,369
the post digital compact acquisition I

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,889
got caught up inside the layoffs and

00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:18,720
thrown to the curb so while I'm sitting

00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:22,009
there waiting to figure out what I'm

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,679
going to do next I got contacted by the

00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:27,779
publisher of info world saying we've

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,820
seen your writing and we're just losing

00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:32,639
our open source columnist would you like

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,610
to be our open source columnist and so

00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:37,679
that ended up being part of a career

00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,749
move which was you know not any cards I

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,419
was holding life is what happens when

00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:44,340
you make other plans and so I ended up

00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,350
being a columnist infoworld a columnist

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,289
at processor magazine I did the Linux

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,440
show webcast for those old enough to

00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:54,570
remember the Linux show and you know it

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,179
sort of brought on an entirely different

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,759
mode of operation for a few years until

00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,429
I got back into sort of hardcore

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:06,299
software again but when you're an

00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:10,110
open-source guy or gal and you learn how

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:14,369
to stand up and say something or write

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:16,619
it down the reach of that is tremendous

00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:20,129
and you can't know where it's going to

00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:23,279
go but it is a tremendous thing to do so

00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:25,559
you know don't you know don't say well

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,749
it's just a blog well it may be just a

00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:30,240
blog but that blog may open a door for

00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:32,750
years from now in a place that you've

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,350
never even heard of so

00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:39,310
do it do it well and learn to do it and

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:55,160
other doors may open for you they will

00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:58,070
ya linux outlaw is yes so another plug i

00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,410
would like to make is for the women in

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,960
the audience is the ADA initiative it's

00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:07,190
the initiative does outreach to women

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,590
and also specifically on how to's and

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,900
roll please and classes and training on

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,640
how to do programming and how to do

00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,400
public speaking and how to engage in

00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,130
meetings and how to do the finances so i

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,650
recommend ADA initiative to the women in

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:24,920
the audience and then the internet is

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,310
full of resources as I said earlier this

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,180
was just a syllabus not textbook it's go

00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:33,790
and learn pocket question the back I

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,160
just had a short little comment to it

00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:39,290
I'm one of the ones has an awesome

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:43,700
open-source job but I'm not a programmer

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:45,800
yeah I do software support but it's

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,190
amazing how almost everything you said

00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:53,840
was relative relative to my career field

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:55,790
as well oh yes it is relevant and I

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,140
would actually run of the things I

00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,910
recommend is to make a little bit more

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,650
relevant as the projects that you are

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,110
supporting you should probably start

00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,850
learning the code bases for so you can

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,500
answer bet on answer questions and you

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,230
support for it better and that involve

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,120
and had a program in those languages

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,950
there's a question here no just a

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,860
comment I wanted to just say from my

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,830
career the writing in the speaking went

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:23,020
hand in hand yes because we had in my

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,610
group have to write very clearly and

00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,860
approached technical people as well as

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,900
executives and not only when we write

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,590
and do projects we have to present them

00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:36,260
to executives and others so it is able

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:38,030
to employ is important yes and as I

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,950
mentioned one of one of the things and

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,100
it's um something I put my note to the

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,929
last minute last and

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,210
because I realize how important is is a

00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,580
great number of my most important

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,220
speaking engagements and writing

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,990
projects are not in front of a big

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,700
audience like this it's when I have to

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,039
stand in front of one executives desk

00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,660
and make a presentation or a pitch or

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,120
convince them with something and that's

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:05,000
also a skill you have to practice and

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:07,590
you have to rehearse any other questions

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:19,350
all right again thank you very much for

00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:21,090
coming and enjoy the rest itself your

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,620
customers rely on your website or

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,020
application if it's slower

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,929
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,760
and costs you money keeping your

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:33,280
business critical systems humming along

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,590
requires insight into what they're doing

00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,540
your system metrics tells stories

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:39,550
stories that can reveal performance

00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,890
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,450
other problems but how do you keep an

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,090
eye on all of your systems performance

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:49,120
metrics in real-time and record this

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,890
data for later analysis enter longview

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,900
the new way to see what's really going

00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,060
on under the hood the long view

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,130
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,590
of all your systems providing you with a

00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,950
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,530
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,300
load and network usage click a specific

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:09,700
system to access its individual

00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,210
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,620
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,300
comprehensive network data including

00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,610
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,169
available on the network tab and disk

00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,090
rights and free space on the disk

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:24,940
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,460
displays usage statistics for individual

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,650
processes the system info tab shows

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,870
listening services active connections

00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,030
and available updates adding long view

00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,710
to a system is easy just click the

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,870
button copy the one line installation

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,300
command then run the command on your

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,010
linux system to complete the process the

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,200
agent will begin collecting data and

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,030
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,580
start rolling

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:50,950
use longview to gain visibility into

00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:54,690
your servers so when your website or app

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,690
