the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,630
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,970
possible my name is cheery cabral and

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,390
this is white hat google hacking mysql

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,190
i'm a senior database admin / architect

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,980
the a stands for both things at Mozilla

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,989
and that's my website and my tweet

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,030
twitter name and all that whatever so

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,879
what is white hat google hacking well

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,690
attacking y'all know hacking is the good

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,770
kind not the cracking kind using google

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,270
so you're using google to do this

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,920
hacking and it's white hat meaning

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,420
you're the good guys so you're basically

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,190
trying to find out things about your own

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,710
systems or like a friend system but not

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,800
like trying to break in and steal you

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,329
know information so where to start well

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,909
the first thing you could do is to do

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,369
some searching so for example this

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,010
website is the the Google hacks database

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,049
ghd be it's at hackers for charity it's

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,850
I don't know what Johnny i hack stuff

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,580
coms I think they were taken over by the

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,180
hackers for charity and so this is the

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,350
google hacking database so if you wanted

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,939
to do something you know you start

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,530
clicking here and looking at things for

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,159
example you go to like error messages

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,130
and then you know find in page for mysql

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,810
okay here's a here's an error message

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,729
from mysql here's a mysql error with

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,290
query so you click on this little

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,570
information link and you say okay what's

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,810
this mysql are with query admin rates

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,450
this a two out of 10 this is a generic

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,759
mysql message so depending on the actual

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,860
message you keep clicking through it you

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,710
can actually this now does Google search

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,119
for it so the thing is this will show up

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,470
like on a web page you know if you've

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,790
ever liked had a web page you can't

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,140
connect to the database is unable to

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,270
connect to database that kind of thing

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,890
you can get some information so this is

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,380
actually going to Google and looking at

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,930
things so we can see this this thing

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,690
that had this this error was at my

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,510
school error with query MySQL error well

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,920
it's not here anymore but is it cash is

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,319
not cash but you can see my school

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,520
select seedot see item is item id like

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,180
it's basically showing you the query

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,459
here so this is one way to use you know

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,330
google hacking with mysql here's another

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,300
one from a similar one i dot numbers

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,030
item ID you know star from nucleus blog

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,780
so you know it's kind of neat nucleus

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,430
seems to have us a lot so you can start

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,290
kind of like looking around and just you

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,370
know your hacker you probably like doing

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,590
this kind of stuff and just clicking

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,380
around or whatever so the hackers for

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,640
charity has that Google hacks database

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,830
right on there and you can play around

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,150
and and look at some good stuff so

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,739
that's kind of gives you a sense of like

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,049
what is google hacking and you can like

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,069
put your site into we'll talk more about

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,840
it but you provide is probably going to

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,900
know you could put your site into my you

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,750
can do site colon sherry calm and search

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,310
for things security advisories so you

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,650
can find things like that you know like

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,660
does mysql have a security advisory does

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,049
it have some kind of message so you can

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,180
actually go to a website and do

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:17,880
something do you have powered by

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,280
wordpress on your site and if so then

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,459
people can say oh wordpress 5.7 had a

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,049
vulnerability i know about that and then

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,299
you know companies themselves might have

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,070
specific things like if you say oh we

00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,590
have all of our stuff managed by X

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,120
company and X company has a breach so

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,120
it's all about what do you put publicly

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,130
out there on the net Google's Terms of

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,959
Service so here's something interesting

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,660
google recently changed in terms of

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,690
service a couple months ago as you

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,530
probably know right now the Google Terms

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,670
of Service is very very vague but pretty

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,880
much says you can do whatever you want

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,680
it used to say you have to be over 18 if

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,410
to be 18 or over you can't do any

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,359
automation you can't do there's a lot of

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,680
stuff that you can't do that's not in

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:03,810
the terms of service anymore so that's

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
actually kind of interesting that they

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,440
took that stuff out i mean does say like

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,450
you don't or anything illegal but it

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,680
doesn't really say no automation so i

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,329
think they've gotten better about rate

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,709
limiting but that used to be in the

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,510
terms of service this is something that

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,579
if you really want to do this for reals

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,109
check the terms of service when you

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,280
start because six months from now it

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,930
might be a different term of service as

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,320
well but the interesting thing is you

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,400
can go to the past versions you know so

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,070
right now it's

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,900
oh this is right behind here the Ewell

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,180
terms of service is very kind of human

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,090
readable and everything you know don't

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,550
misuse our services it doesn't give you

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,259
any ownership or IP rights our services

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,710
display some contents not googles and

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,199
it's not ours so it's a very small you

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,669
know very short very easy to read that

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,270
kind of thing and it just basically says

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:53,910
you know don't do anything wrong but if

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,650
you go to past versions this is where

00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:02,070
you get to to the big long legal

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,260
document and there are some things where

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,289
it says you know provision of the

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,639
services use of the services by you you

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,580
may be required to provide information

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,229
about yourself for registration you

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,880
agree not to yeah you agree not to

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,440
access or attempt to access any of the

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,300
services by any means other than through

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,979
the interface that is provided by google

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,560
unless you've been specifically allowed

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,509
to do so in a separate agreement you

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,740
specifically agree not to access or

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,270
attempt to access any of the services

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,160
through automated means including these

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,510
of scripts or web crawlers and shall

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,520
ensure that you comply the instructions

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,740
set out and wrote any robots.txt file

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,720
present on the services that's no longer

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,970
in the Terms of Service it used to be it

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,720
just says now don't misuse the services

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,340
is automation misuse maybe maybe not

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,260
like I guess if you're using it for bad

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,030
then that's fine which is good you

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,500
shouldn't kill the method you should

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,349
just kill the intent behind it right

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,030
like Napster wasn't necessarily bad as a

00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:56,039
file sharing service it's just everyone

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,909
was using it for bad things so it's kind

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,900
of interesting to see what's not anymore

00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,820
but it used to have all that other stuff

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,320
in the terms of service so it's kind of

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,659
interesting and I wonder if it's still

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,490
really kind of there or not but just

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:10,740
make sure legally that you're not doing

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,080
something illegal so if you're going to

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,729
be doing white hat Bing hacking or white

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,919
hat yahoo hacking using those search

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,300
engines that of Google make sure that

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,010
you are not violating the terms of

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,849
service because the last thing you want

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,500
to do is go to jail password hashes so

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:29,400
was anyone here in my MySQL security

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:31,050
talk no awesome so there are hash

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,449
dictionaries out there so for example

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,419
what's this password here well you don't

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,250
know and no it's is it's not password I

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,599
don't think its password the cool part

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,150
is is that since this is on the web the

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,680
first hit

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:47,650
this is my my website with the thing so

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,990
here this is cool this hash hash in and

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,840
this is pages you know 0 through 307

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,280
there's 10 tons of pages to go through

00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:00,220
it has an md5 sum the md5 of md5 the

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,800
mysql password and the sha-1 of you know

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,560
things like Curtis thunderboy hail hail

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,740
top capital so things like 12 274 tooth

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,060
and L 0 for 1 and orange 22 so it's not

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,860
just dictionary words it's probably they

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,660
stole some password lists or they have

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,790
some algorithms going so if you look

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,640
here it's actually penguin that's what

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,900
this guy did a find in page for that and

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,700
it came up as penguin and this is

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,320
actually a real example there was some

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,870
application whose user name was penguin

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,070
which in retrospect and I was like oh

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,500
let me see if I can figure out what this

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,600
password is and i typed into google and

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,690
i got it so it's not just things like oh

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,660
the password hash of password that's my

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,110
dad calling he knows i'm doing a

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:45,490
presentation so he's probably calling so

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,400
that's kind of interesting where you can

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,320
actually reverse engineer a password not

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,740
by using a password cracker but just by

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,610
using google which i think is kind of

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,290
cool what else can you use so how to use

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,910
google i'm going to go through this

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,010
little fastest i'm pretty sure you guys

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,690
probably know this stuff wild cards are

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,100
star and dot I'm you might not have

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,190
known wild card so if you want something

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,490
like secure versus security you can type

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,450
sec you are star and that you know will

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,220
kind of fill in the rest for you

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,320
although Google is pretty good if

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,320
anyone's at Bruce's talk nut Bruce's

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,730
Richard hips talk the other day about

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,560
full text search he was talking about

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,470
how they kind of get the base of the

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,970
word there you can search different

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,510
media types you can search images only

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,160
or you can search news articles or blogs

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,550
and then there's also a boolean search

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,840
so you can say like plus this minus that

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,660
he's ands and ORS and all that kind of

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,980
stuff Google basics actually this is a

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:49,870
little out of date I think it's a 15

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:52,420
word limit now let's see I wonder what

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:58,170
the limit is

00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:09,430
for google's search terms it used to be

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:13,240
10 it might have changed by now let's

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,220
see now it might be more unlimited I

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,019
thought it was like 15 or something

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,970
because it used to say like showing

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:24,639
showing results for the first 10 words

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:26,680
or something so that may not be that may

00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,510
not be in effect anymore and is assumed

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,670
so basically when i typed in that whole

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,920
sentence is assuming that I wanted I and

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,070
wonder so it's still kind of a boolean

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,380
search you can do or with the pipe so

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,889
you'd say foo or bar that's how you do

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,709
it and there's a whole list of operators

00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,449
yes I can close that there's a whole

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,870
list of operators that you can use with

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:51,459
google and there's a whole cheat sheet

00:09:49,870 --> 00:10:02,410
on it and we can go to it but things

00:09:51,459 --> 00:10:04,769
like you can do the sites no that's an

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,769
errors

00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:19,339
yes it is my slider on help oh help

00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:26,800
operators and help cheat sheets so

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:32,149
here's um help OIC help operators oh

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,559
that's operators dot HTML I'll be able

00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,929
to follow so this is you know if you can

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,670
do a phrase search exactly as is with

00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,589
quotes around it you can search within a

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,999
specific site with site colon you put a

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,069
negative you fill in the blanks with

00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:45,290
wildcards and you have the or operator

00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:48,129
there are exceptions and punctuation

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:51,499
that's ignored so it shows you that and

00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:56,569
then the cheat sheet is what I really

00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:58,129
wanted to show you which goes to the

00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:00,319
same thing apparently I think it didn't

00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:03,709
used to let me change that on the slide

00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:05,569
because it's not important the site does

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,249
matter so if your google hacking for

00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,540
your site only you don't just want type

00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:12,230
stuff into google you want to type stuff

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,549
with like site colon cheery calm and see

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,410
this stuff used to be there file type

00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,850
versus in url so you could actually

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,749
search for specific file types you can

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:24,170
say file type colon PHP file type colon

00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:27,589
bmp4 bitmaps or PNG for portable

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,540
something graphics files versus in url

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,819
so you might want to say i want to get

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,299
PHP files should you say where file type

00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:36,199
is PHP or where in URL is PHP might be a

00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,610
little different if you're doing

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:39,949
something like HTML you don't want to

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,100
say in url HTML because there might be

00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:45,230
HTM files or CSS files might render is

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,449
HTML and these are these are all called

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,670
google dorks by the way the kind of the

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:52,040
the search term you use to google hacker

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,660
site is called a google dork there you

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,819
go that's the useless trivia for you one

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,959
day it'll be in some quiz show so if you

00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:00,920
do so you can do something like this

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,139
site dub dub dub she recom in url ? ID

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,850
equals and then arrange search so the

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:09,499
dot has range 1 to 10 100,000 and if you

00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,759
do that you would find theoretically if

00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:15,490
I had any anything where it says no ID

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,899
oops i would have to put into google

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,329
it's searching there so you can actually

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,560
well it's not on sherry calm but you can

00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,330
go out and see who

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,610
does have that here this is woodbury

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,620
common premium outlets it knows this is

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,930
actually an outlet in Massachusetts

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,710
which is kind of funny or maybe it's New

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,029
Jersey no wrentham villages in any way

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,750
so if you see if you can see this as

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,400
premium outlets outlet a SP ? ID equals

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,450
seven so if you wanted to see because

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,190
now I can I can go here and I can I can

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,620
do this and I can say oh I wonder what's

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,779
article what article 8 is about and you

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,790
actually used to be able to do this one

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,670
pro Kona had their conference when you

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,080
submitted the your sessions to approve

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,330
it you could actually do this you could

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,080
like when you had your note or whatever

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:06,020
was there using Drupal Drupal they had

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,540
it was like you know / no 2 / whatever

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,580
and you know smells like / notes / 100

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,450
was mine and a friend of mine pointed

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,610
out that you could actually go to like

00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,110
note 101 and you can see other peoples

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,700
and you could do the whole thing so I

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,560
told Burke are no bad they fixed it but

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,660
this it's kind of funny to be able to

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,380
you know obviously who cares if I go to

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,360
article 9 or I go to article 10 on this

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,040
premium outlets see this is wrentham

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,560
premium so I'm getting a different one

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,200
every time but it's kind of neat to see

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,460
that you can actually do that and look

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,740
for it on your site to see if someone

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,170
can put like ID number one ID number two

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:43,580
things like that to try to hack your

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:46,670
site so the range is pretty useful here

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:49,280
most people know about site already in

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:53,390
url you may not have known and also the

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,130
dot dot for the range so common paths so

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,350
what are some vulnerable locations of

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,210
common paths like if you're using a CMS

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,130
content management one of the things

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,900
about open source is double-edged sword

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,820
in this kind of a way you know having a

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,990
default password is kind of a

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,100
double-edged sword because you want a

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,300
password but if it's the default

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,610
password everyone's just going to know

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,950
it and with open source you can see what

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,350
tables are named you can see what's

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,089
there and it's kind of its double-edged

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,610
sword because for security it's a lot

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,980
easier to figure some things out because

00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,029
I have to do is read this source code

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,810
usually it's a lot better for security

00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,920
because a lot of people are hacking it

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,000
it's not indifferent for proprietary

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,000
software is the comments

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:43,010
right they'll document their default

00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,480
passwords or whatever here well it's

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,190
it's not even that it's not just like

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,870
past or just feels like table names you

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,490
know it's a little harder to figure out

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,990
obviously table name somebody can look

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,790
in to see it but yeah right for any

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,260
popular product you can find this kind

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,820
of thing but I mean you know there's a

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,140
lot there's a lot of programs out there

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,020
and some are open source and some aren't

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,060
so in the general case yes but you're

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,530
right specifically you know if you

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,210
figure out what Oracle's default

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,310
username and password is it's not that

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,550
hard to do you know Scott tiger or

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,550
whatever

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,070
yeah paychecks had that

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:42,139
right right so yeah the idea is right i

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,670
mean it's it's it's less about an

00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:50,959
obscure obscure versus a used program

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:54,769
right because because a what Josh was

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,130
saying was a more secure more obscure or

00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:59,540
non open source software might not care

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,220
some they might think that they have it

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,170
there that they're safe because you

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:07,459
can't read the code but they put it in a

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:09,230
file that you can crack so it you know

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,600
it is putting it out there in the open

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,430
though does make it it is good because

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,810
it makes it more obvious right you if

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,069
you say okay everything's out there in

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,240
the open I have to worry about it as

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:20,959
opposed to oh don't worry about it's

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,880
closed who cares so here are some things

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,829
to try if you really want you really

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,209
want to cause some damage in url delete

00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:32,690
dot PHP question ID equals you know link

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,040
private comedy not your calm when I when

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,209
I started working for Mozilla was really

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,370
awesome because we're really open about

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,410
a lot of things and so I went looking

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,240
for a Mozilla slide template so I

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,360
searched in google for mozilla slide

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,220
template and I got here to wiki down

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,380
mozilla.org look it's and you can see

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,449
I've clicked it before imma zoe HTML

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,089
slides so i can download a slide

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:55,370
template right here because our internet

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,050
is public right we have a wiki that's

00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,930
public and this is public and purpose

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,569
but if i wanted to see like anything

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,150
about socorro and our internal you my i

00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:06,260
say might say site and this is a little

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,419
dangerous i haven't done this before

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:16,319
internet mozilla dot is it org or com

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:21,579
internet mozilla org oops

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:23,439
hmm would say yeah no it was a question

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,959
it was a question but I answered it so

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,890
site internet mozilla org and let's try

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:32,529
mysql and it did not match any documents

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,630
because intranet is our private Internet

00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,850
and if I go there I you'll see I'll have

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:41,860
to login I hope if I'm not already

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:47,830
blogged in mozilla.org yeah see

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:49,840
authentication required so yeah we

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,620
mozilla requires you to have passwords

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,840
that are at least 12 characters long and

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,270
have at least two character classes of

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,320
lowercase uppercase or lowercase special

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,610
character or appliqued special

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,080
characters so it not yet we're working

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,960
on getting browser ID everywhere but we

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,580
have ldap everywhere so there's only so

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,419
much dogfooding we can do but we are

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,940
dogfooding it so you know there are some

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,039
cool things to try so you just just link

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,620
you know or I said link private comm Oh

00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,380
link so link is like if it's in a link

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,480
right so if if you want to do like SEO

00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,940
on your site so this is actually even

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,510
better link and I just want link

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,830
intranet mozilla org enough nobody links

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,320
to it so like I could have a link on

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,539
cheering so if i wanted to do some s and

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,179
not SEO but if i want to see who links

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:42,490
to me i can see links eerie calm oh look

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,620
planet mysql links to cheer calm that's

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,970
great there's a palomino DB blog that's

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,580
company I used to work for that links to

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,710
she recom somebody else links to me so

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,330
this is in links you know Ronald's

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,809
linking to me an effective mysql down

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:58,600
here you know this is what's in the

00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,159
actual like URL of you know the the href

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,640
when you do it so that's actually pretty

00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,320
powerful as well so yeah so you might

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,720
want to say in url to see if Google's

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,700
index it but even more important you

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,350
know what employee is putting stuff on

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,960
like some web page that they think is

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:18,580
not indexed by Google you know a number

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,669
Ainge also works as well so in url

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,230
config.php right that would be really

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:28,370
useful let's see if i have anything like

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:35,320
that in url shiri calm

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:37,910
a site shiri calm in url config.php and

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,309
there's no matching documents because I

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,830
test all my examples that I put up there

00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:44,480
before I should have something that you

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,860
know just as haha this is not a config

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,240
page but I don't so these are these are

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,410
pretty powerful you can come up with

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,080
your own I really like the delete PHP

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:59,470
more to try so you know it file type PHP

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,360
in url ID and then test out injection

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,160
this is interesting so this colon star

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,790
colon star that's usually like a

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,660
username and password so if you if you

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:14,540
do something like this that's not going

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,929
to work at all keep putting in the URL

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:22,940
bar you know did you mean this well why

00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:25,820
yes let me go ahead and do that let's

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,309
see I probably this so star colon star

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,230
why is he doing star colon start doesn't

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,800
look like it has a colon in these URLs

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:43,070
oh this page Cullen oh I want to do in

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:44,660
URL is what I want so anyway you there

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:52,010
are some things where you'll have the

00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:57,559
there's a username and password in in a

00:20:52,010 --> 00:21:00,350
in a URL and that's not I might need to

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:04,179
escape something at any rate now that's

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,179
a good use case for using the Stars

00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:19,099
yeah well no that's if ya anyway this is

00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:20,719
neat intitle remote desktop web

00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,789
connection what do you think might

00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,829
happen if you find a site I know Sheree

00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,690
com doesn't have it remote desktop is

00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:28,969
like a Windows you know remote desktop

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:34,639
whatever so well we don't want any so

00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:37,819
you know- in url microsoft because we

00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:41,899
don't want any yeah remote desktop web

00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:43,849
oh we want yeah Oh in title yeah in

00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:47,299
title so in titles another one the title

00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:48,709
is this thing that appears up here so if

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,319
somebody has a remote desktop web

00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:53,629
connection program it probably has a

00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:55,219
default title for the webpage there so

00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:56,809
you can find yeah so here's the remote

00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:59,719
desktop web connection for this virtual

00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:02,239
lab so go to this website you know link

00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:03,799
below so we go here to this remote

00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,479
desktop and there was a server error

00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,349
because apparently it's not set up

00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:10,369
properly or on blocking pop-ups probably

00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,959
so it's kind of neat to be able to see

00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:14,509
like as anyone is somebody at my

00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:16,809
workplace running this remote desktop

00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:19,219
web connections to try to get to their

00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:20,539
to their work machine when they're not

00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:23,319
at work like I they trying to bypass

00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:28,329
security by doing some of these things

00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:28,329
so that's kind of a neat case as well

00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:36,769
further said to study i forget what this

00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:40,789
is because i did this for a conference

00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:42,469
last month so i don't remember what what

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:46,489
i actually connected to these articles

00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:49,369
so yeah for google searches to run to

00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:53,659
run on your own company so one of them

00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:55,759
is in url CSS CSO online com what you're

00:22:53,659 --> 00:23:00,139
looking for is registered domains here's

00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:02,659
the colon you know it's in title apache

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,789
tomcat error report that kind of thing

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,349
so if you're looking you want to see an

00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:10,749
error report because apache gives a

00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,749
really detailed error report

00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:18,390
here we go let's see if we can still get

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,570
it oh no it's it's got a different

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,780
problem now there we go so here's a nice

00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,450
you know apache tomcat 7 void 0 to 25

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,660
error report you can see all this nice

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,250
stuff and you know you can maybe figure

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,400
out what kind of software they're using

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,990
find their vulnerabilities let's see so

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,100
what you're looking for technologies use

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,330
this is actually pretty good article

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,460
because it explains what you're doing it

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,039
for here's this is probably where I got

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,679
remote desktop web connection and then

00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,750
there's a Paul com is a security podcast

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,150
that is excellent or at least was

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,900
excellent I've no idea if they're still

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,520
still running anymore because i was

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,630
listening them a couple years ago but i

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,090
hope they are because they're they're an

00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,429
awesome awesome podcast and they have

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,460
all this stuff you know type HTML viagra

00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:06,000
say your site or teen hardcore site your

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,700
site that's pretty good for a while I I

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,780
combats again ipod combats camel I

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:16,950
combat spam a lot so if you do you know

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:19,380
site WWE com and you look for cialis you

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,330
might actually find something nope good

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,360
i'm clean of spam right now but it's

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:25,650
useful to find cuz you know man and if

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
you have like God for beauty of a wiki

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,320
on your page or something it's just a

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:35,580
spam magnet filetype rdp so again remote

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,200
desktop protocol file type PST you know

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,730
so it basically has a thing you know

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,679
let's teach you how to fish into the

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,360
throne salmon at you go to this security

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,640
thing go to daily web application

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,440
vulnerabilities find a good one read it

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,940
come up with a google search for it so

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,980
it's actually pretty cool to do so these

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,690
slides will be up online somewhere or

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,330
other i'm sure they are up online

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,470
because you can actually when you want a

00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,870
google search for the password you can

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,010
find it so white hat google hacking

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:08,789
mysql i'm sure you can google for

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:11,460
security volunteer d dot and in olvidar

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:15,090
you is the same thing and security

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:18,690
security vulnerabilities and it's up to

00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:21,299
date and it comes out once a week and it

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,270
has lots of stuff so if we find in page

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,960
for mysql can we do it can we search for

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:30,840
my SQ

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:34,440
up here see a MySQL privilege escalation

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:38,190
this was news in 2008 let's see if we

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,250
can find something from 2012 there's got

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,149
to have been something right here you go

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:49,470
in 55 allows remote authenticated users

00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:51,270
let's see unspecified vulnerability in

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,270
the MySQL server component in Oracle

00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,899
MySQL five dot five dot X allows remote

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,549
authenticated users to affect

00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:01,049
confidentiality and integrity via

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:03,539
unknown vectors isn't it though that

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:06,419
yeah because Oracle didn't release the

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:09,720
details but you can click through here

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:13,830
so this for 95 or 96 494 they are all

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,840
the same thing so if you if we click on

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,950
one of these this is actually something

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,450
cool so these have all these

00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,770
descriptions it's different from the

00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,289
ones that's specified in all these other

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,809
vulnerabilities here's the nvd here are

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:28,559
the references so you can actually go to

00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:32,309
Oracle site to see the rep reference so

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,279
it's a critical patch update here's

00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:36,720
Oracle MySQL server so it also affected

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,960
all this you know fusion middleware all

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,210
this kind of stuff but yeah I didn't

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,190
actually show you so here there's a risk

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,809
matrix but I mean there's a lot of stuff

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,049
the other thing it does is it has this

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:52,169
nvd this national vulnerability database

00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:54,330
which is actually quite readable so

00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,890
there's a link to external sources and

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,960
you know it is confirmed all kind of

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:06,090
stuff so there's a lot of stuff at your

00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:07,770
fingertips at security vulnerable at

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,299
work or like you have a job that's like

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,559
you know you're just babysitting a

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,039
machine and you want to like learn

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,390
something to get into a better job you

00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,070
know you could spend your entire day I

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,990
mean I could spend forever on this site

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,820
just clicking things and looking at the

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:24,210
new stuff and you know even just for

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:28,370
MySQL there's a ton as you saw so so

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,370
it's a crazy crazy world out there

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,880
defensive strategies so what can you to

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,400
prevent this stuff so so before Google

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,400
finds it on your site what can you do we

00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,960
validate or scrub your input you can

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,170
validate your source so you don't have

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,270
cross-site request forgery you want to

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,050
validate all your information so you

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,320
don't have a cross-site scripting

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,400
forgery there's an SQL injection cheat

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,100
sheet if you don't know what SQL

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,800
injection is it's this has anyone not

00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:08,160
seen this XKCD comic before raise your

00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:09,900
hand okay Oh read it it's funny yeah

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,820
particularly this third one did you

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,350
really named her son Robert quotes if

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,640
you know president will drop table

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,350
students dash dash and you know what I

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,090
haven't put in this now you might say

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,730
well who really uses that in the real

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:28,110
world well hopefully the internet still

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:30,480
works there we go so I just went to

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,330
fetch the headers from reddit com and

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:39,090
says okay it's htpc 201 look at the

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:41,370
server so somewhere out there there's

00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,470
some probably like hacker program we're

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,360
just like spiders the internet looking

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,620
for servers and putting the server type

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,240
in a database so that then you can say

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,890
oh well this person is using apache

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,200
version 1 they're vulnerable you could

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:54,180
do that and it has a table name of

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,010
server types and in fact if you google

00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,350
search for drop table server types

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,750
you'll actually find other people that

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,520
are doing that and it's not just like

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,520
you know the reddit clones out there

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:16,610
it's not well it's not because it's on

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,610
other it's on other people too

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,000
it has a server types see I couldn't

00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,670
figure I was trying to figure it out but

00:29:38,000 --> 00:30:01,930
like boiled beans has it to you know

00:29:40,670 --> 00:30:01,930
tents right right

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,190
right but at any rate it is possible

00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,210
like again it's a double-edged sword

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,650
sort of open source so yeah you know I

00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,500
hope you've learned to sanitize your

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:28,170
database inputs that's great that's

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,430
great for you know trying to get back at

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,260
the people who are trying to hack you is

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,870
to have something like that where you

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,280
know even if the it comes back as oh you

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:36,960
know there's no there's no table called

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,670
server types they still haven't gotten

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,660
your server type they still haven't

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,060
gotten the fact that you're running

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:50,940
Apache one so they don't know that

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:51,930
you're vulnerable so the question is

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,030
isn't this prevented by using

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:57,300
parameterised queries yes however in

00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:00,900
mysql parameterised queries are compiled

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,360
once per session so unless you are doing

00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,010
a query like that and using bind

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,870
variables right more than once

00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,230
procession you're actually doing extra

00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,730
overhead and if performance is an issue

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,410
right it's this trade-off of performance

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,270
and security if you're okay with that

00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,640
extra overhead then go ahead and do it

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,320
but you know maybe about five six years

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,880
ago when I back when i was doing

00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,050
insulting it was like you would go to a

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,610
client site and they would be like our

00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,290
date it like every single query seems to

00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,000
be really slow and you'd be like yeah

00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,320
you're using parameterised queries and

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,210
like well they told us that was how to

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,090
you know validate your input and not

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,920
have any of these problems most code

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:41,010
libraries have ways to validate the

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:42,120
input so yeah if you why would somebody

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,250
doing session so often because they're

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,130
not using connection pooling if they

00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,230
have a very site that's very it doesn't

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,240
require sticky sessions for example a

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,760
load balancer you want something to be

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,110
you know highly available you probably

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,940
don't want to be too sticky in the low

00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,230
balancer you know yeah if you want

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,030
something with like a shopping cart

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,220
where I can see the orders I just put in

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,440
that's great but you know who cares if I

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,390
don't see Josh's facebook comment to me

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,640
for another five seconds you know so

00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:10,920
like Facebook you know uses that kind of

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,300
stuff because they don't really care you

00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,150
know it's eventually consistent and that

00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,950
kind of thing so yeah I mean there are

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,980
valid reasons for doing it and not doing

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:22,410
it yeah if parameterised queries works

00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,690
for you then go ahead and use it most of

00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:27,159
the like high performance tip

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,049
out there are stuff that most people

00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,940
probably will never need right like I'll

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,609
never need it for suree calm I just

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,529
don't get that many hits that doesn't

00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,940
mean I don't do some caching but like i

00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:38,440
just installed a drupal module that

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,929
their wordpress module that has crap

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,950
caching for me I'm not really too

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,509
worried about it because if somebody

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,759
really wants to load my article that

00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:47,739
wait three seconds is that it to you

00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,239
know and if I don't sell my article to

00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:51,339
them I don't really care i've lost a

00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:52,929
reader Oh L like it's not like I make

00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:57,219
money based on how many people read my

00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:59,259
article so there's more another bigger

00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:01,389
URL to you can read more if you really

00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,700
want but you know it's basically if you

00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:05,229
have something like this if the count is

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,149
greater than zero login this is a really

00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:12,159
crappy example but it gives you a sense

00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:14,440
of it and so you know if the if the

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,269
password is high quote or 1 equal one

00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,789
then you say you know where username is

00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:21,879
whatever sheer your food or whatever and

00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:24,579
pass equal high or 1 equals 1 well this

00:33:21,879 --> 00:33:28,539
and pass equal high or 1 equal one is

00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:30,070
always going to be yes because you know

00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,179
even if you know if your password

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,279
happens to be high and they're storing

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,109
in plain text then that's poor but you

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,879
know you it'll either accept that or one

00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:39,820
equals one well that's true so the whole

00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:42,159
thing is true so look for semi colon

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,489
backslash lowercase G backslash capital

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,979
G quotes Union those all are basically

00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:51,909
ways to kind of try to hack that look

00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:54,489
for HTML encoding it's something that I

00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:57,070
sewer for dating site and we had a guy

00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:59,979
call and complain he's like my my

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,049
profile isn't showing right like it only

00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:03,549
has like half the did my description we

00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,059
looked and he'd started to say something

00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:09,099
and he had like Open bracket G closed

00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,109
bracket for like a grand I guess I don't

00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:13,419
know using some kind of whatever and so

00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,279
up until that his profile display you

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:17,980
know was like hi I'm looking for someone

00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:22,240
to have fun with you know angle bracket

00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,520
capital G angle bracket if you also want

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,849
to have fun you know contact me well

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:31,899
that whole last part the the G the HTML

00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:33,609
tag basically 4G and on was lost then we

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:36,129
went I'm like oh okay we've restored

00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:37,540
your profile we just should we made code

00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:39,429
to escape it and we just

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,840
escaped it manually for him and then you

00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,160
know worked on code to actually escape

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,320
it if somebody puts an angle bracket in

00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,330
there and then we went and searched for

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,210
the guys who this is a gay dating sites

00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:51,820
they're all guys we search for all the

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,520
guys who had angle brackets in their

00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,830
profile and we found two guys who had

00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,200
some javascript in there who were going

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,460
to like their click for pay say that

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,870
like every time they get a click they

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,710
get like you know half a penny or

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,720
something like that and we were like

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,430
these guys are clever like the one guy

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,230
you know was just trying to like make a

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,300
smiley face or whatever but these guys

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,540
really clever so obviously we put the

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,520
kibosh on that but it was I was I was

00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,790
blown away about how clever it was like

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:23,320
I never would have thought to do that

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:25,720
look for null or car 0 which is the the

00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,480
null character these can do things like

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,100
cause buffer overflows which are bad if

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,510
you're using for our car and the empty

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,050
string you know just be careful with

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:39,910
things like that Savior it saves what

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:43,240
what yeah so if someone's inserting car

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,500
0 into things you just want to be

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,620
careful cuz they might be trying to do

00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,980
something funny like if somebody has as

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,360
their username know might be there might

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,160
be trying to be because they might have

00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,770
like you know they might say like null

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,990
or you know whatever you know or know

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,490
plus something just going to end up

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,440
being null it's just one of those things

00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,720
that these things shouldn't show up in

00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,790
the normal course of action so if they

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,130
do someone's either trying to be funny

00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,870
or trying to do something damaging but

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,850
it's not as obvious as like HTML coding

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,160
is probably something bad it could also

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,810
be someone doing by accident by

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,010
validating your input you also save

00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,050
yourself time for example if you

00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,480
validate an email address as such or an

00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,100
IP address as such then when you go to

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,050
use it you don't have to worry about you

00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,750
know your your email address not working

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,390
because instead of saying Escobar all at

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,560
mozilla com I gave us Cabral at Mozilla

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,410
well that's not going to be a valid

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,810
email address there has to at least be

00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:40,480
username at something dot something

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,220
there might be more dots there might be

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,480
a long username you know there's this

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,460
whole you know RFC about what usernames

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,369
and passwords usernames and I and host

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,990
names to look like for email so

00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,400
there are libraries out there do that

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,200
for you but the very least it should

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,140
have the format of foo at bar dot

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,309
something and it saved yourself time

00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,720
when you're emailing them because you

00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:03,609
you know you'll know that that's not a

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,690
valid email address and you're like wait

00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:05,890
a minute that doesn't look like a valid

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,140
email address are you sure that's right

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:16,359
oh no it's s cabral at mozilla com I

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:17,859
forgot that hmm the question is the new

00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,809
name your own TLD think is going to be a

00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:21,099
problem no because you still have to

00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,890
have it you still have to have a

00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:31,509
top-level domain you know komm doch

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:33,700
shiri dot whatever yeah there has to be

00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:35,499
at least one period in the host name

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,640
there has to be an ad site it has to be

00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:38,529
something followed by an outside

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,240
followed by something followed by dot

00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:42,249
followed by something so it has to be at

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,630
least one character in all those things

00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:49,210
so it can be like a at BC but it has to

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,619
at least be in that format you know so

00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,390
I'm not saying go ahead and validate the

00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:55,119
email address and make sure that B dot C

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:58,710
is a valid thing I mean you can do that

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,710
but some people that's way too much work

00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:10,539
remand and that's at least you know part

00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:13,749
of the way there you know you'll write

00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:16,239
to do a real RFC and and here's the

00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,710
interesting thing I believe that there's

00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,769
something like underscores are not

00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:23,319
allowed in the host name in mail and

00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:26,200
mail MX records you're not allowed to

00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,559
have an underscore which Microsoft

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,390
Exchange doesn't actually honor so I

00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,400
remember back at Tufts this is you know

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,619
11 years ago at this point we we

00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,910
upgraded our system I think it was from

00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,859
send mail to post pics or something like

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,450
that or or something better something

00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,349
worse does something better anyway it

00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,160
wasn't postfix I think there's a

00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:48,400
postgres to who something maybe begin

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,839
with an e anyway we upgraded yeah

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,450
excellent that's what that was it exim

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,190
so we upgraded and all of a sudden

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,869
people were like I can't this person

00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,579
can't email me or I can't email as

00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:59,200
person anymore what gives and we

00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:01,239
realized that so with Microsoft Exchange

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,700
name your server you're like sheer easy

00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,930
mail or whatever and it converts spaces

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,200
to underscores

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,819
and underscores are not allowed in MX

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,770
records so I don't know if that's part

00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:15,220
of the RFC for email addresses I know

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,569
it's part of the RFC for MX records most

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,190
of the stuff that I know is because I

00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:19,990
ran into it as a problem like I don't

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,990
sit there reading rfcs although if you

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:26,140
want to read rfcs Tom Lehman celli has

00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:29,380
compiled a book of the April Fool's Day

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,880
rfcs that you can buy and if you don't

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,740
know who Tom mom and chelly is and

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,569
you're in system administration you're

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,160
in the wrong business go by any of his

00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:37,030
books so he's a great one called time

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,150
management for system administrators

00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,000
that is not very long it's like you know

00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:46,119
100 or 200 pages very good anyway back

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,859
to security so you know you want to

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,420
avoid things like buffer overflows and

00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:50,770
you want to make sure that your

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,470
character said is in line with what

00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,329
you're expecting in HTML forums you give

00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,559
you have a text box and you're limited

00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:58,660
to a certain number of characters you

00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,329
say Oh input type equals text you know

00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,890
length i think equals ten that's ten

00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:04,569
characters but that's not so he gonna be

00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,069
10 bytes so you want to make sure you

00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:09,099
don't have those kind of mismatches with

00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:10,839
mysql or with any database system and so

00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:13,450
you kind of you know you're not just

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:15,010
validating the user input for malicious

00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,420
thing you're also trying to validate it

00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:18,220
so you don't end up shooting yourself in

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,380
the foot that's kind of a side benefit

00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:23,859
has nothing to do with security trust

00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:27,369
and get or post only trust get or post

00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:29,170
from certain pages you know cookies even

00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:30,790
with valid session IDs I mean people can

00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,410
spoof sessions and all that kind of

00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,740
stuff so just be wary about how you're

00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,750
doing it no that with any kind of saved

00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,569
data like a cookie or trust and get her

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,089
post there's a way to fake that now that

00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:45,400
doesn't mean that you shouldn't use

00:40:43,089 --> 00:40:47,290
these at all just because someone can

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,329
break a window in my car doesn't mean

00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,099
that I never lock my doors and it

00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,440
doesn't mean that I never go out to the

00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:55,480
mall and park my car there it means that

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,970
i lock my doors and I try not to leave

00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,559
anything expensive on the seats so that

00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,109
nobody's going to you know be tempted to

00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:03,490
steal anything but you know I still go

00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:05,079
to the mall even though anyone can break

00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,089
my window and he was like well you could

00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:08,470
spoof a session ID no cookie yeah but

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,210
you know there are certain measures you

00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,710
can take to make it harder you know so

00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,299
take those measures and know that you're

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:15,760
taking an informed risk and that's it

00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:18,280
for using PHP's register globals equals

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,410
off this is you know Vera this is

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,990
dude if you were doing PHP 10 years ago

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:26,590
you know this so it's it's kind of old

00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:28,210
old you know information that's still

00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,250
valid today register globals what that

00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,320
does is it changes a post variable into

00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,750
a gap variable so post variable is a

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,420
field that's in that's you know save for

00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,610
one web page to another with get its

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,820
you'll see it in the URL so when we saw

00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:44,950
like ? ID equals whatever that's a get

00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,540
variable you could have also had it in a

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,340
post variable which doesn't show up in

00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,290
the in there but with register globals

00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,330
it goes off you could put something in

00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,830
the get variable so you can kind of hack

00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:57,400
it that way or you say oh she recom

00:41:53,830 --> 00:42:00,760
question ID equals foo and it will read

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,310
it so i like to say when not if you are

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,970
going to be hacked at some point in time

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:06,700
somebody's going to have something

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,350
against you you just have to figure you

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,180
just have to depend on that I mean it

00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,130
may not be true but you have to act as

00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,690
if it's true you know I talked about

00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,340
going to the mall and you know leaving

00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,950
my car in the parking lot i drive a

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,370
toyota rav4 my previous car was a toyota

00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,570
corolla nobody really wanted to steal it

00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:24,040
you know it didn't it's not like it had

00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,140
like a I guess I could have made it even

00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,210
less desirable to steal by having like a

00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,410
car seat in it for a baby and like

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:31,480
having you know cheerio spread

00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,160
everywhere nobody wants a dirty car but

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,400
you know it's it's not a sexy car and

00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,680
the rav4 is not a sexy car either so you

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,840
know so too you know that's not a sexy

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,870
car that's you know that's like cheery

00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,730
calm it's not really a target Mozilla

00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,290
might be a target for hackers or the

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,750
Department of Defense is like driving a

00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,520
Porsche you know like if you work for

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,770
the Department of Defense you know maybe

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,780
you have a car alarm maybe you've like

00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,300
registered your car with the police or

00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,580
with LoJack or whatever they call it you

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,350
know to do that but like you know you

00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,030
take more precautions if you're a bank

00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,700
you're going to be a target things like

00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:08,020
that but you still you know just because

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,700
just because I drive it to it around

00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,910
four again it doesn't mean I don't lock

00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,650
my doors so one thing to think about is

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,230
how is your application database access

00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:19,420
stored so your application right it

00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,210
probably has a config file that has the

00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,650
password and clear text so you might say

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,820
well if somebody wanted like steal all

00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,400
my data they have to like steal my

00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,650
program and steal my database well guess

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,190
what if they still your program think

00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,470
it's to your database

00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,329
so that's a tough one there are there

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,950
are some tools out there to encrypt like

00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:38,270
your file system and stuff a lot of

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,280
people do that with their desktops or

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,260
laptops you might think about doing that

00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:47,000
with your with your machine with your

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,680
servers as well it doesn't do anything

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,720
for employee well it does actually cuz

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,579
you it's only the the application would

00:43:50,720 --> 00:44:05,150
have the key and you would need the key

00:43:52,579 --> 00:44:06,980
as well so yeah I mean well that's if

00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,020
they can so the point the point you're

00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,270
making is if someone can log into the

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,710
file system remotely it's not a big deal

00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,810
but they would have to have the

00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,520
decryption key they wouldn't be able to

00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,530
access the file system unless they have

00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:27,020
that decryption key which I mean again

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:28,579
the application has to have so hmm if

00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,290
it's the whole file so mystery mounted

00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:32,390
know the application has the key as well

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:39,410
but the application can store the key

00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:42,290
somewhere else yeah right yeah and

00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:45,079
basically secure your as secure as your

00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:46,910
most unsecured not insecure that's

00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:49,730
different I'm insecure my programs are

00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:52,520
unsecured it's as strong as your weakest

00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,680
link is right so a lot of the times for

00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,690
example the problem is SQL injection but

00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,000
why is it SQL injection because they

00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,310
didn't validate their data right so the

00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,140
question is is that MySQL being weak or

00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,640
is that the application being weak like

00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,190
the PHP code or whatever it's a little

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,079
bit of both right I mean minus QL has a

00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,300
syntax oh I don't know if you can really

00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:12,650
blame that on on the database it doesn't

00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,440
have to be bias comee postgres whatever

00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:17,119
like it has a database syntax there are

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,060
ways that you can say in all the major

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,700
programs to not allow multiple queries

00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,990
to your database meaning you can't put

00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,270
two statements in there you can't put a

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,130
semicolon there that'll do it for you so

00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,109
to me that's kind of the connector let's

00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,990
say being weak because it's allowing

00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:34,880
that and there's no vaccine if you get

00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,760
hit you know there's no there's no way

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,290
to like you know say okay I have a

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,609
firewall in place and I'm done like when

00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,130
you get a vaccine the idea is you get a

00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,890
shot and you're done whether it's for

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,680
ten years

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,000
or for life you know you're done you're

00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,039
you're good against the disease for a

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,390
certain amount of time and that amount

00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,130
of time will be forever there's no

00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,809
security vaccine there's no like okay

00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,640
I'll just put a firewall in front of it

00:45:54,809 --> 00:45:58,559
and then I'm done a lot of people think

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,630
that and a firewall is good it's another

00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,619
door to lock and and you should do it

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:07,049
but it's not the only thing there are

00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,279
some regression testing tools so these

00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:11,220
are kind of cool all of these are

00:46:08,279 --> 00:46:12,500
desktop things so let's go to one of

00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:16,440
them because it's been a while since

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,460
I've actually looked at them and they

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,099
might not work because some of them were

00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:26,039
kind of old so let's see ya guling craps

00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:30,059
can smash I think that's the list i have

00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:36,529
there and yeah these are files and tools

00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:40,500
crafts can scans the root directory and

00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:44,220
I wish documentation is better I'm

00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:47,509
guessing it scans for crap the question

00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:49,799
is automatic automating a site search Oh

00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:51,420
so what you could do is you can so when

00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:52,920
I say test or when I say we're crashing

00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,640
Dustin what I mean is let's say you

00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,289
found viagra on your site so now you can

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,779
save that search in a tool like crap

00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,009
scan so you don't have to go redo that

00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,480
Google search because maybe you had 50

00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:04,529
google searches and three of them had

00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,450
problems and maybe you're going to add

00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:07,650
another 50 tomorrow because you know

00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,150
you're kind of keeping this database you

00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,279
can use these tools to save your things

00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,690
and say hey today do I solve that

00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:14,309
problem then you can start putting it

00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,730
into monitoring systems and all that

00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:20,160
kind of stuff so those are some those

00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,559
are some nice tools as well to do I

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,289
think I'm getting close to the end of my

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,849
time and closes eyes some more actions

00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:28,980
there's google hacking software there's

00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:31,559
google hacks honeypot just kind of neat

00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,019
and just as no Google does on or

00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:37,200
robots.txt or at least did at the time

00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:39,359
of this writing and there are

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,160
vulnerability checking tools gulag WIC

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,359
doughnut dough these are things that

00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,529
have google queries in them so like crap

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,240
scan and stuff where you could save it

00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:49,950
these have like libraries of ones that

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,329
you just say run against my site these

00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,839
are the desktop tools actually that i

00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:53,839
was talking about

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,960
right right so that's a good point that

00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,700
may be why I put down the slide the

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,320
point is that Google honors robots.txt

00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,910
so if you have a very restrictive one

00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,010
and that's one way that you're kind of

00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:16,410
trying to be more secure well Google

00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:18,450
honors it but hackers might not honor it

00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:20,040
probably won't honor it so you know

00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,260
don't be like hey don't look in this

00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,830
directory called super secret password

00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,780
information because other folks will

00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:29,100
will do it but you know and that's also

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,710
something that you won't find it in your

00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,890
assessment if you're using google to to

00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,240
do that so yeah I have a podcast you

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,890
have a CD in your little plastic bag

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,090
that's what that is I wrote a book

00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,260
called the my school administrators

00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,690
Bible there's a whole chapter on

00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,430
security there and it has none of this

00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,840
information and even talk I didn't even

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:50,370
open the can of worms of google hacking

00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:53,090
in that security chapter so yeah anybody

00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:56,960
have any questions comments feedback

00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:00,060
list of things to do when you get home

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,730
so going to any presentation on security

00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,440
if it's good at all is like watching

00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,030
that biology video when you're in high

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,950
school about like all the bacteria

00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,960
that's on you and then you want to go

00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:12,090
take a shower it's kind of like that

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,780
where you're like oh man I gotta I gotta

00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:21,410
go man fix some stuff or check some

00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,410
stuff so great thank you so much

00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:25,069
ah

00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:08,800
prospects I every way this is the way to

00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:10,720
better utilize all your resources and it

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,780
makes managing all your resources pretty

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:18,640
easy all of the innovation is happening

00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:22,000
in open source the collaborative nature

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,430
and of the you know of the community and

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,260
then the speed at which these are these

00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,940
you know these these deficiencies these

00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,490
bugs are getting discovered and then

00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,710
fixed is it I think that really shows

00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:35,470
the power of the of the open source

00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,619
community it is global and it's

00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:41,170
definitely because of the users

00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:47,050
community people are extremely friendly

00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:48,849
and always ready to help if you go an

00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:51,070
entire see any day you'll see these guys

00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:53,710
helping each other out and they're all

00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,390
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,410
product is transparent for everyone

00:50:55,390 --> 00:51:01,599
everyone can look at the code base

00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,810
everyone can see how close duck is being

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:09,310
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:11,920
everything is open in many ways it's

00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:16,420
absolutely vital to the the unborn

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:20,619
health card stack the most exciting

00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:23,470
event in recent memory for me was our

00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:26,109
first developer boot camp

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:28,750
and our call gay people I gave me two

00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:32,710
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:36,880
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:39,730
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,250
chairs in the room twice everything

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:45,490
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:48,550
is open source and so I don't think that

00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,320
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,349
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,900
computing and so i think it's i think

00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:57,430
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,540
about cloud computing you're really

00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:04,090
talking about open source cloud

00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:07,240
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:09,640
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:13,540
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:16,210
each data centers these hardware is

00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:19,690
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:22,390
to handle number one that mass scale

00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:25,570
number two it's designed to handle the

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:28,450
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:32,619
deployments started working on contact

00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:35,890
over four years ago and it was the

00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:37,690
original set of people working on it had

00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,770
a background of delivering software

00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:46,030
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:49,630
lots of users actually using it high

00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:52,720
availability is a key feature multiple

00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:54,730
hypervisors support different network

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,430
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,680
you better while step management server

00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:03,369
can be deployed in different physical

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,020
machines it definitely has a huge

00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:10,000
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:12,580
there's a major movie studio that they

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,880
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:17,859
to transcode video and I thought that

00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,510
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:22,780
more fascinating is what they did during

00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:25,570
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,740
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,570
lunch was over they would

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:32,830
all the instances and go back to doing

00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:34,330
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,400
so many different aspects and there's no

00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:38,770
one person that's kind of like a master

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,880
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:45,100
as a project is going to be one of the

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,180
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:54,610
most feature fallen and and robust

00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:57,510
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,510
living through the clouds dag

00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,380
you

00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:20,510
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:22,730
ago we could not have imagined that

00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,950
asterisk would not only become the most

00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,080
widely adopted open source communication

00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:29,120
software on the planet but that it would

00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,640
impact the entire industry in the way

00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,620
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,260
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,210
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:40,280
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,690
transition of power from the hands of

00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,970
the traditional proprietary phone

00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,370
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:48,320
administrators of phone systems using

00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:49,520
this power our customers have created

00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,470
all sorts of business changing

00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,330
applications from small office phone

00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,850
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:57,440
the international carrier networks in

00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:59,240
fact there's even an entire country

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,820
those communications infrastructure runs

00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,770
on esters the gym has always been about

00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,480
creating technology that expands

00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:07,640
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,840
we could never have imagined and that's

00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,600
part of what's game-changing about

00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,910
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,010
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,140
IP phones that extends control of the

00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,880
user all the way to the desktop the

00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,590
launch of these new products represents

00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,600
the next phase indigenous history of

00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:26,090
innovation these are the first and only

00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,440
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,120
power of esther's when we first

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,770
discussed our expectations for building

00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,380
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:35,180
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,920
asked the team to build the phones such

00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,140
that they were easy to install integrate

00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,970
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,520
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:45,170
that goal user feedback is validating

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,270
that when it comes to operation with

00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:49,700
astro space systems including our own

00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:52,280
Switchvox based product these are the

00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,570
easiest to use best integrated most

00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,180
interoperable products on the market

00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:58,150
today the Digium family of phones will

00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,260
initially include three IP des hommes

00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:02,150
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,040
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,710
these phones are different for a number

00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,350
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,790
designed for use with esters secondly

00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,400
we've made it really easy to

00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:14,780
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,880
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,490
to access information inside of asterisk

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,430
allowing tight coupling

00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:22,390
between an application and the phone

00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,550
additionally we've created an

00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,680
applications engine that allows users

00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:29,920
and developers to create and run their

00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,690
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,640
done all of this at a very compelling

00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,320
price point at Digium we're always

00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,420
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,940
the best value in business phone systems

00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,650
and also give them the power to create

00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,690
their own solutions or eating

00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:45,400
communications challenge will continue

00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,840
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,910
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,500
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,990
asterisk and what communications even

00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,700
easier and together we'll change the way

00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,700
