in return and it will happen so the puss

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,210
Russell's frustrated what happens

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:49,510
replication is master has its copy data

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:52,120
and runs out James Barack way to Israeli

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:56,559
invasion from that modified come home

00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:02,309
copy we get there for the Bible you have

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,309
two copies within beta we are two types

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:09,779
asynchronous which means an after this

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,779
keeps going all your way here

00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:27,940
he copied it from the surf of the master

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:33,539
server is a lot of your wrist rotation

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,539
crashes all staff duty is interest I

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,249
have certification was cheerleading

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:51,369
deposit amount of bull transactions

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:55,840
without be able to do this every sorry

00:21:51,369 --> 00:22:04,809
committee stated has a vegan empire and

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:13,269

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:17,249
know not process given to log on our

00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:22,960
patient is your hammer try to eat your

00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:25,440
servers on home run kreega hell that

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,480
sort of a mail server on state line

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:34,889
asian will kill all three in the

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:48,509
pathways some people need is a master

00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:52,250
server so be bigger at another location

00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:55,340
you don't have to replicate everything

00:22:52,250 --> 00:23:03,120
Victor bodywork your lossless replicate

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:04,919
cables cables personal about rape fins

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,700
like standard deviations we have any

00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,169
state in the u.s. pocket broadwater so

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,200
if you have cable to the state

00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:20,820
abbreviations is without a battery a

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:26,750
gorilla now some very welcome again

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,750
we'll move on provocation out water web

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:34,350
developers you have application held

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,820
announcer we've got to split the reason

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,820
right we have

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:47,340
read and master out here a scare rights

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:51,720
and memories the regular master read

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:55,080
Romania lost out here great for reading

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,980
this map ages now if you're using class

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:03,650
2a 54 or 55 next generation fighter and

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:06,870
install last you on the story is petal

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:10,530
extension eventually repeats throat

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,860
monitor what's going on the plate and

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:16,049
master or slave over the last night and

00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:21,059
also here I will be spending a little

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:24,720
bit to my career control gasps and the

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:32,160
whole right for every box or recently

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:35,640
Teddy you can do boxes look at these new

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:40,760
heart cake for Hitler came to power on

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,760
occasion gave birth aged people

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:49,500
copy of data we have the were made for

00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,820
kitchen which is the output of the a

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:59,980
result of these people say the game

00:24:51,820 --> 00:25:06,550
right now past we do need change the two

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:09,520
columns entire row we spit all over now

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:18,240
we get smart presenting photography and

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:18,240
college change which was probably a lot

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:36,310
in past five and four TV news data table

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:39,210
and put me crash dunno how to go from a

00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:44,029
transaction for penny

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:49,500
kid and we can keep all main application

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:57,320
as ever but it's very very easy to get

00:25:49,500 --> 00:26:01,649
out what he took this file and with it

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,659
intermediate so the best price is it

00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:05,760
would be come back to life it goes

00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:11,100
what's been committed in what has it

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,809
been rebuilt everything we been as a

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,299
cheers and we're trying to get us a

00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:23,990
great reputation of hardware but

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:23,990
software so now the crushed take place

00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:32,669
is dedication to burn a little

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,500
transmission didn't ask enslaving out

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,500
checks on so that's what

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:51,340
goodbye so we're privatizing for prime

00:26:42,789 --> 00:27:15,370
is about perturbation repeat used in

00:26:51,340 --> 00:27:17,730
immedi the basket is a velocity now the

00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,730
on position

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:16,640
Walker is a fancy decamp how dangerous

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:24,340
not that dangerous Natalie we need you

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:27,470
lock a cable for expert and copy data

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:31,730
parameter so you're kind of putting your

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:39,610
own cloud and house 492 will be put here

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:39,610
to the data is there a classic service

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,120
pretty table

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,250
I saw us

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:52,130
I'm just hit the server is an already i

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:54,320
authorized come on by and cash not get

00:29:52,130 --> 00:30:01,340
rid of me ever in parlor job on your

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:03,380
video session i'm times faster so if you

00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,660

many of you have good idea his

00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:06,630
initiative and how many get a level

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:10,160
decline to the sequel query Sanders your

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,160
question is how to find in Z

00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:15,490
everything is going to be death house

00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:29,840
watercolors fluted columns used on right

00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:38,990
hand part of the stated i usually

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:41,750

00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,200
system to access its individual

00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,710
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,120
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,770
comprehensive network data including

00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,110
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,670
available on the network tab and disk

00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:42,590
rights and free space on the disk

00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,440
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:47,960
displays usage statistics for individual

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,120
processes the system info tab shows

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,370
listening services active connections

00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,500
and available updates adding long view

00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,210
to a system is easy just click the

00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,340
button copy the one line installation

00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:00,800
command then run the command on your

00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,480
linux system to complete the process the

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,670
agent will begin collecting data and

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,470
sending it to longview then the graph

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,080
start rolling

00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:11,450
used longview to gain visibility into

00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:15,190
your servers so when your website or app

00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,190
heats up it stays up

00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:25,509
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,700
way to better utilize all your resources

00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:31,150
and it makes managing all your resources

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:34,979
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:38,499
happening in open source the

00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:40,299
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:42,400
of the community and the speed at which

00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:44,410
these are these you know these these

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,690
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,299
discovered and then fixed is the thing

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,999
that really shows the power of the you

00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:53,650
know of the open source community it is

00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:57,849
global and it's definitely because of

00:46:53,650 --> 00:47:00,219
the users community people are extremely

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:05,440
friendly and they're always ready to

00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:06,940
help if you go an entire see any day

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,219
you'll see these guys helping each other

00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,589
out and they're all doing it like in a

00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:13,479
selfless manner the product is

00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:17,259
transparent for everyone everyone can

00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:19,719
look at the code base everyone can see

00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:22,329
how close that is being built nothing

00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:27,430
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:32,920
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:36,789
to the the ongoing health I'll stack the

00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:40,730
most exciting event in recent memory for

00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:43,490
me was our first developer boot camp

00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:46,130
and our call gave people like maybe two

00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:50,090
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:54,260
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:57,110
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:59,630
chairs into the room twice everything

00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,960
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,960
is open source and so I don't think that

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,700
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,730
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,460
computing and so i think it's i think

00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,810
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,920
about cloud computing you're really

00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:21,470
talking about open source cloud

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:24,500
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,630
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:30,920
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:33,590
in each data centers these hardware is

00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:37,070
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:39,770
to handle number one that mass scale

00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:42,950
number two it's designed to handle the

00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:45,500
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:48,460
deployments started working on college

00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:51,550
attack over four years ago

00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:54,160
it was the original set of people

00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,349
working on it had a background of

00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,160
delivering software telcos and service

00:48:56,349 --> 00:49:04,540
providers lots of QA lots of users

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:07,660
actually using it high availability is

00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:11,140
the key feature multiple hypervisors

00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:13,660
support different network models you can

00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,700
pick up whatever suits you better while

00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,630
step management server can be deployed

00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:21,430
in different physical machines it

00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,080
definitely has a huge footprint it's

00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:28,480
being deployed everywhere there's a

00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:30,240
major movie studio that they were using

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,400
CloudStack they were using it to

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,589
transmit video and I thought that was

00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,910
terribly fascinating what I found more

00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:40,180
fascinating is what they did during

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:42,940
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,320
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,240
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,380
the instances and get back to doing real

00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,700
work cloudstack is vast it touches so

00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,800
many different aspects and there's no

00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,170
one person that's kind of like a master

00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:00,250
of all those realms I think clouds stack

00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:02,500
as a project is going to be one of the

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:06,550
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:12,130
most feature fallen and and robust

00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:14,910
platforms out there Adam senior living

00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,910
for the clouds dag

00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,790
you

00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,890
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:40,109
ago we could not have imagined that

00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:42,330
asterisk would not only become the most

00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:44,460
widely adopted open source communication

00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:46,500
software on the planet but that it would

00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,020
impact the entire industry in the way

00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,000
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:53,640
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,590
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,690
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:59,099
transition of power from the hands of

00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,349
the traditional proprietary phone

00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:03,750
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:05,820
administrators of phone systems using

00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,470
this power our customers have traded all

00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,570
sorts of business changing applications

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,369
from small office phone systems to

00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,470
mission-critical call centers to

00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:15,300
international carrier networks in fact

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,740
there's even an entire country those

00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,020
communications infrastructure runs on

00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,150
esters the gym has always been about

00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,859
creating technology that expands

00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,020
communications capabilities in ways that

00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:26,220
we could never have imagined and that's

00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,980
part of what's game-changing about

00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:31,320
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,390
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,520
IP phones that extends control of the

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:37,260
user all the way to the desktop the

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,000
launch of these new products represents

00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,070
the next phase indigenous history of

00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,500
innovation these are the first and only

00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:45,210
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,740
power of esters when we first discussed

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,780
our expectations for building a family

00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,940
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,680
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,300
the team to build the phones such that

00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,520
they were easy to install integrate

00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,349
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,930
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:02,550
that goal user feedback is validating

00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,680
that when it comes to operation with

00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,080
astro space systems including our own

00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:09,660
Switchvox based product these are the

00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,980
easiest to use best integrated most

00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,560
interoperable products on the market

00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,530
today the Digium family of phones will

00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,609
initially include three IP des hommes

00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:19,430
uniquely designed to complement any

00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:21,420
asterisk or switch box base solution

00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:24,089
these phones are different for a number

00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,730
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:28,170
designed for use with esters secondly

00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,780
we've made it really easy to

00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,160
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,260
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,210
to access information inside of asterisk

00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,200
allowing tight coupling between an

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,780
application and

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,940
phone additionally we've created an

00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,070
applications engine that allows users

00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,650
and developers to create and run their

00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,720
own apps on the following and finally

00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,760
we've done all of this at a very

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,470
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,240
always thinking of ways to give our

00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:56,640
customers the best value in business

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,530
phone systems and also give them the

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,660
power to create their own solutions or

00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,550
any communications challenge will

00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,230
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:06,270
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,890
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:10,380
asterisk and what communications even

00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:14,060
easier and together we'll change the way

00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,060
the world communicates again

00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,880
most enterprises today realize that

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,530
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,900
enough to keep their network saved from

00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,970
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,010
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,140
popular lately that adds that extra

00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:36,809
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,579
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:40,770
know is that some two-factor

00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,990
authentication solutions they're better

00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:46,020
than others like two-factor strong

00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:48,299
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,250
beyond other authentication systems by

00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:53,309
being less expensive easier to implement

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:55,799
and easier to use giving software-based

00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:58,650
token clients built to run on all major

00:53:55,799 --> 00:54:01,250
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,569
Android these tokens utilize a

00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,819
public/private key combination that's

00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:07,950
generated and on device so there aren't

00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:10,470
any shared secrets flying around for

00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:13,319
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:15,180
special handling instead all keys are

00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,670
kept secure and private between the

00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,859
requesting token and your server which

00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,470
you control in-house making it the most

00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:24,150
secure way possible to perform

00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:26,940
authentication encryption and with an
