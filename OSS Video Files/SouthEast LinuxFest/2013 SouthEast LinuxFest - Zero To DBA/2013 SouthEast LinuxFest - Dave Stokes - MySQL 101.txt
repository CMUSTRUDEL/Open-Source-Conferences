00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:36,169
with it well

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,740
most enterprises today realize that

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,480
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,820
enough to keep their network saved from

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,890
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,930
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,060
popular lately that adds that extra

00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,730
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,500
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,690
know is that some two-factor

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,910
authentication solutions they're better

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,970
than others like two-factor strong

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:02,220
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,200
beyond other authentication systems by

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,260
being less expensive easier to implement

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,720
and easier to use giving software-based

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,600
token clients built to run on all major

00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,170
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,520
Android these tokens utilize a

00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,920
public/private key combination that's

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,870
generated on device so there aren't any

00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,390
shared secrets flying around or

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,270
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,130
special handling instead all keys are

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,590
kept secure and private between the

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,780
requesting token and your server which

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,370
you control a mouse making it the most

00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,070
secure way possible to perform

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,860
authentication encryption and with an

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,650
extensive flexible API and support for

00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,630
protocols like LDAP and radius wicked

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,840

two-factor authentication for the first

00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:00,950
time or just ready to ditch your

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,350
existing expensive key file system we

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:08,260
can help with easy to implement easy to

how's that sigh every way this is the

00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,540
way to better utilize all your resources

00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:24,990
and it makes managing all your resources

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:28,819
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:32,339
happening in open source the

00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:34,109
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:36,059
of the community and and the speed at

00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,950
which these are these you know these

00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:40,109
these deficiencies these bugs are

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,480
getting discovered and then fixed is it

00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:43,919
I think that really shows the power of

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,679
the you know of the open source

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,859
community it is global and it's

00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,379
definitely because of the users

00:34:48,859 --> 00:34:58,260
community people are extremely friendly

00:34:52,379 --> 00:35:00,089
and always ready to help if you go an

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,280
entire see any day you'll see these guys

00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,920
helping each other out and they're all

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,630
doing it like in a selfless manner the

00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,619
product is transparent for everyone

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,780
everyone can look at the code base

00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:15,050
everyone can see how close that is being

00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:20,549
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:23,220
everything is open in many ways it's

00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:27,630
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:31,829
health CloudStack the most exciting

00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:34,620
event in recent memory for me was our

00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:37,320
first developer boot camp

00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,960
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,920
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:48,090
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,940
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:53,460
chairs into the room twice everything

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,820
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,790
is open source and so I don't think that

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,530
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,560
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:07,140
computing and so i think it's i think

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,640
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,750
about cloud computing you're really

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,300
talking about open source cloud

00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:18,330
computing cloud zac is a robust solution

00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,490
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:24,750
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:27,420
in each data centers these hardware is

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,930
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,630
to handle number one that mass scale

00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:36,810
number two it's designed to handle the

00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:39,660
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:43,860
deployments started working on contact

00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:47,100
over four years ago and it was the

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,900
original set of people working on it and

00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:53,010
a background of delivering software

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:57,240
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:36:53,010 --> 00:37:00,870
lots of users actually using it high

00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,930
availability is a key feature multiple

00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:05,970
hypervisors support different network

00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:08,640
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,890
you better well step management server

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,580
can be deployed in different physical

00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,260
machines it definitely has a huge

00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:21,240
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:23,820
there's a major movie studio that they

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,000
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,100
to transcode video and I thought that

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,750
was terribly fascinating what I found

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,020
more fascinating is what they did during

00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:36,780
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,010
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,840
lunch was over they would dis

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,920
helping instances and get back to doing

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,540
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,640
so many different aspects and there's no

00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,010
one person that's kind of like a master

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,090
of all those realms I think CloudStack

00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:56,340
as a project is going to be one of the

00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:00,390
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:05,850
most feature fallen and and robust

00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:08,750
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,750
living for the clouds dag

00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:23,680
you

00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,739
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,959
ago we could not have imagined that

00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:36,150
asterisk would not only become the most

00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:38,309
widely adopted open source communication

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,349
software on the planet but that it would

00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:42,869
impact the entire industry in the way

00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:44,849
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:47,459
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:49,440
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,539
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,920
transition of power from the hands of

00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,199
the traditional proprietary phone

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,599
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,519
administrators of phone systems using

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,749
this power our customers have created

00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,699
all sorts of business changing

00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:04,559
applications from small office phone

00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:07,079
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,670
to international carrier networks in

00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,469
fact there's even an entire country

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,839
those communications infrastructure runs

00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:14,969
on esters the gym has always been about

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,680
creating technology that expands

00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:18,869
communications capabilities in ways that

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,069
we could never have imagined and that's

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,440
part of what's game-changing about

00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:25,140
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,239
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,369
IP phones that extends control of the

00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,109
user all the way to the desktop the

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,819
launch of these new products represents

00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:34,920
the next phase indigenous history of

00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:37,319
innovation these are the first and only

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,670
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:40,349
power of esther's when we first

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,999
discussed our expectations for building

00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:44,609
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:46,380
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,150
asked the team to build the phones such

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,339
that they were easy to install integrate

00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,199
provision in use I think you'll soon

00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,749
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,400
that goal user feedback is validating

00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:58,499
that when it comes to operation with

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,930
astro space systems including our own

00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:03,509
Switchvox based product these are the

00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,799
easiest to use best integrated most

00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:07,410
interoperable products on the market

00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:09,380
today the Digium family of phones will

00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,489
initially include three IP des hommes

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,380
uniquely designed to complement any

00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:15,269
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,910
these phones are different for a number

00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:20,579
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,019
designed for use with asterisks secondly

00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:23,630
we've made it really easy to

00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,009
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,690
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,540
to access information inside of

00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,660
asterisks allowing tight couple

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,620
between an application and the phone

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,780
additionally we've created an

00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,910
applications engine that allows users

00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,490
and developers to create and run their

00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:42,560
own apps on the following and finally

00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,600
we've done all of this at a very

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,310
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,110
always thinking of ways to give our

00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,480
customers the best value in business

00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,340
phone systems and also give them the

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,500
power to create their own solutions or

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,390
any communications challenge well

00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,070
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,110
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,850
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,400
asterisk and communications even easier

00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:07,900
and together we'll change the way the

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,900
world communicates again

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,510
your customers rely on your website or

00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,880
application if it's slower

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,819
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,619
and costs you money keeping your

00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:30,099
business critical systems humming along

00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:32,950
requires insight into what they're doing

00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,960
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,210
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,369
resource limitations and other problems

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,319
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,900
your systems performance metrics in

00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,749
real-time and record this data for later

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,729
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,769
see what's really going on under the

00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:52,869
hood the longview dashboard lets you

00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:54,880
visualize the status of all your systems

00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:57,609
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,729
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:03,190
memory swap processes load and network

00:42:00,729 --> 00:42:05,769
usage click a specific system to access

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,749
its individual dashboard then click and

00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:10,749
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:12,759
more detail comprehensive network data

00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:15,460
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:42:12,759 --> 00:42:17,049
is available on the network tab and disk

00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,940
rights and free space on the disk

00:42:17,049 --> 00:42:21,789
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:24,339
displays usage statistics for individual

00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:26,499
processes the system info tab shows

00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:28,749
listening services active connections

00:42:26,499 --> 00:42:30,880
and available updates adding long view

00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:32,559
to a system is easy just click the

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,719
button copy the one line installation

00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,150
command then run the command on your

00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,859
linux system to complete the process the

00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,049
agent will begin collecting data and

00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:42,900
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:45,450
start rolling

00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,819
used longview to gain visibility into

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,559
your servers so when your website or app
