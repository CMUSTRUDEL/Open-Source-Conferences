00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,370
our visual basic or older

know just be sorry is it part of your

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:55,370
cut so we loved by God is part of

00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:00,180
masters so might as well part of other

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:07,960
really think horrible

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:12,730
all right settle up and into their

00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:19,750
various startup scripts are programs for

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:25,210
my scope d is the primary minor the txt

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:27,550
my server will be very isolated state

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:40,170
I'm sure a lot more familiar with it is

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:40,170
a script that helps you restart

00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:53,449
Conway heart their scripts that we all

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:59,089
have the Sultan Duarte this all for me

00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:04,649
and a few of distributions all as much i

00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:10,710
spected say MySQL or maestro d on my

00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:13,249
solo server in Indiana to boot up on

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,249
startup

00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:37,039
it's 50 games may have been by the

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:45,439
Basil's and just as reference good urs

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:53,719
bottom as we go walls and get one fish

00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:58,359
it out though there's 25 miles number

00:05:53,719 --> 00:06:01,819
one pipe already gathered with maestro

00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:07,149
it's how immortalizes for her signing on

00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:09,499
to check for much too dangerous doing

00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:15,729
probably the checkered sea will be

00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:15,729
strike we're starting to add baby races

00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,060
features into the server so that we have

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:30,180
something that you can go in query and

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:33,780
really figure out much better

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:38,730
Diagnostics on whether you have to see

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:44,780
queries are five people on the network

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:56,870
autism my cell admin great way to

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:56,870
quickly check the variables or server

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
password

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:23,330
the third is Venus new 506 known as

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,720
members do you have too much scripts

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:29,750
premised well better on my karma say on

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,370
a nightly basis or weekly basis you have

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,819
to buy a certificate right so right now

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:42,770
there's really no good way to improve

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:46,220
that password safe from prying eyes so

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:51,889
if I never seen anybody look at aiesec

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:59,270
jettisons there so that's one liars how

00:07:51,889 --> 00:08:03,740
come you didn't let you basically set up

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:07,639
refined oils to and store that

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,430
information inputted file in your

00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,509
where were you said about in their own

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,270
project and you're right moves by again

00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:20,840
so for example using the day after i get

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,900
set up whole hog and just a madcap to go

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:29,120
in bukit databases maybe work with a few

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:34,099
minutes I guess I Sarah plugin oh but

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:37,459
Bruce call the latest Alicia maestro

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,560
except mobile lighting easily without

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:43,540
supplying all the information on the

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:48,649
command line or keeping it in an open

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:52,100
format bus instead of lions to monitor

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:55,400
and just basically say i'll show you how

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,430
to sort by supplying just a mascot

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,940
in half and given me one of those things

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:05,930
that you set out in Russia novels that

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,200
pilot sees you it's a minor God for all

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:12,170
passion fruit in the five and only to

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,590
look at the college's bad until we cut

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,590
out information so

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,360
and it's not the uws care products and I

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,610
can celebrate this probably not using

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:46,630
the highest level

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:49,000
pastor but the same from my back out

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:53,380
those things you don't have to supply

00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,899
passively war in clear text so it is one

00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,899
step logging town sir I filled up my

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:12,300
size database stops people do something

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:16,110
very odd you should i use your network

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:20,709
some people will know needed others do

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:24,640
if what would use my throat well let's

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:28,639
say CSU hot cider so let's eat some

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:34,439
kebab except so somebody gives you

00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:41,329
v5 and you doing today well I shall let

00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:45,059
you book that in in to receive our

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:48,809
report if you buy one for second here's

00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:52,169
a fire you for attack it's got a lot of

00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:55,619
options you can set villagers to find

00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:57,509
mother's you can specify which columns

00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:01,409
you want above it and we're going to

00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:04,139
watch you go very helpful you can change

00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:12,809
value or cop for national importance of

00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:17,329
it which is also last is exercised my

00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:17,329
visits testing

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:42,340
alright so going to be so much will be

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,340
is Russell's so

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:04,920
so you know how the apple TV news is if

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:10,329
you want to go every single possible

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:14,170
input in a friend to my solution set if

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:18,010
you get this remote desktop on my study

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:20,800
process itself you'll get it really long

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:27,329
as the every single crunch which we ever

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,329
start sir I wanted to know specifically

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:48,529
and what I'm looking for is answer is

00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:56,300
something as a somewhat movie person I

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,890
alright

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:27,040
right right app is we listen

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,140
what I will show you this out you can

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,000
you can see here going to tell you what

00:13:52,140 --> 00:14:05,430
order to commercial I don't know you've

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,820
ever notice any clothes visit my sister

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:13,890
will not tell you the fever's avatar

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:18,180
there's no a certain measure which were

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:22,110
the path actually it will surely every

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,930
value if you got a business set and

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,720
useful to know that if you don't specify

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:30,660
if I'm sorry sir police are searching

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,330
Boo's link it will basically look all

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,640
and it will still a little jacob

00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:39,230
parameters from all those lives did you

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:45,000
go right goes up in the last-minute rush

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:52,530
with all japan the other thing is it

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:55,620
reads each group within my body I don't

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:58,350
get it something I said make a friend he

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,780
said it's not a reason each addition

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,780
based chat is it in our path where you

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,980
getting into a big problem starts up and

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,980
are you have

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:21,960
so the way we figure is you force it to

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:25,620
use the gearbox you step all five people

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:37,350
to a half a lot and you're forced to eat

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:40,680
at all time it's one way that I don't

00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:44,370
know a GOI I don't know the last one

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,730
these same process actually uses forces

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:51,770
it and it does i think it's also one of

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,770
those when we pass it is

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:08,780
if you always want the end you can see

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:14,810
all variables that is foldable slots are

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:23,650
all very sensor another until its use is

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:23,650
I price defaults

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,730
give you the whole lot

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
ton what session you want you

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:58,649
my first Paul will do is it will face

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,010
the tendon Hauser will be started up the

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:06,209
exact degree spot a few seconds into

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:11,160
bigger spot one way is to evaluate

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:18,809
what's be pop services are and of course

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:22,949
you always look at processes and even

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:25,550
with Bill plan so process itself and we

00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,550
started out

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:49,890
I still at it again we go alright so my

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:59,549
short life so so this is how this name

00:17:49,890 --> 00:18:03,900
where you look at the extra call this

00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:08,130
note high end with a semicolon or a

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:18,020
backlash kappa g or FSG today was a

00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:21,480
significant server we generally have

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:28,409
context help middle with an advice for

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:33,260
client so if you want to know no sir

00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:33,260
some kind of distributed others

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:53,610
so that you helped turn these old houses

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,340
that are available for gas hi after

00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:00,780
after single names if you want some help

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,550
pacifica mansion we got options and this

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,680
is general exceptions that you can help

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,570
more if you want to do help or

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:15,330
specifically you something i call

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:27,350
password flat and you know that worst

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:32,880
attacks that we aspire and so some other

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:34,590
usual commands that is news this will

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:44,510
know our people know that we actually

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:44,510
set the pager that she's 55 so let's say

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:57,740
from all the stables phone packs if I

00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,740
said Hagar to

can put any unix command or a script as

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:24,100

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:36,159
scripture because this game optimax in

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:46,630
seconds with your output set and you

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:49,960
left so it's great little guilty you

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:56,679
find a little better start to turn about

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:59,100
will say all just say okay just a major

00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,100
and

00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:27,790
so nothing you do is let's say you want

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,500
to save batt full session which is a

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,320
particular part of the session if you

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,520
are for example works is eternity

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,740
purposes for whatever so we also let you

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,740
t kids Wow

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,799
hey

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:29,990
Oh g-god my appetite you give as much a

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:32,539
halogen wat you can actually want to

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:40,570
come start the whole session you run

00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:40,570
from the command bags are fine today but

00:22:51,610 --> 00:23:00,880
so you notice for what ails you get this

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,880
output three members of you

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:23,770
another index or blog if you want back

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,070
to automatic patent does not use it

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,070
called

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:51,570
in our autumn room so just kind of

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,049
written up so you can keep your own

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:59,889
config file as a director of the levis

00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:04,539
you set parameters within their that's

00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:06,639
always use myself among human

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:11,529
multi-company in attics and get spread

00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:15,730
as user I use our teams at passwords or

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:20,740
Pascal know my school I said all air

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:24,549
base quiet so that's a lot of said get a

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:28,000
usual thing you can do is you can use a

00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:30,220
prop to show who you should walk and use

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,100
that approach it will be richer carbon

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,100
to nitrogen which without

00:24:47,020 --> 00:25:03,970
so options most tile at Porton very

00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:09,550
awkward you also give you a lot of

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:12,670
problems are talking about this because

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:15,820
I actually had someone ask me about a

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:18,430
week ago that was running five runners

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,880
and walkers videos is it isn't really

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:25,660
too password so that we are going to

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,060
spider man alive for recessions mrs.

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:34,890
well yes there is you find it make some

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:34,890
provide sex so

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:12,880
to the editor set audia add your name

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:16,240
user post and you know password your

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:34,360
proper password and then that will

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:40,000
actually create exist in the racially to

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:45,040
my screw-up and actually a club you can

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,010
ask us by a pork or pork or side so he

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:58,000
said we can't ever remote connection is

00:26:48,010 --> 00:27:06,030
elusive still it's helpful if you want

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,030
to see what options are there

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:20,040
so this action Prince at pioneer file is

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:25,370
rated PG there's one two recessions the

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:34,530
passwords appropriately start out see it

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:37,370
danisha we accept that information

00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,370
good

00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:58,230
so I stole them just doesn't it

00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:03,429
customize the latex or table for the

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:07,649
SEMA or various colleges but basically

00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:15,159
is the way folks knew max from in life

00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:19,749
bringing it back to base my father gave

00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:31,259
her 20 min base a lot because it

00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:31,259
produces a single command interpret and

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,640
so in simple form when I showed up your

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,640
ass

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,539
it was

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:36,870
entertainer motoroids or did you so I

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:40,560
say in basis world set up fashions color

00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:43,960
illicit basis you're gonna do just one

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:48,390
it'll input create and use everything in

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,390
done if you just hit world

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,990
if you just want to look at the schema

00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:09,650
simulator and then the Coliseum for a

00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,650
race overall music

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:33,500
I like this awesome we also i do gotta

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:40,010
Gators and but we'll see you in one of

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:44,060
the big i like it because i can take

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:48,140
that and basically do herro I can vote

00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:53,740
you know 15 20 foot once instead of

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,740
making one giant pot that's all my table

00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:08,330
so we have is a definite right I wanna

00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:11,360
have operatives field marshal not to

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:16,400
back director and this is where this

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:20,930
might work that director has to buy / by

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,870
the process that disturbance in my case

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:27,429
under Thomas would also so soon but if

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:36,830
the microprocessor can hide

00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:38,749
it's not you it's actual solar system it

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:42,440
outputs and is wish you would use my

00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:45,580
phone because the u-turn on decision for

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,580
both sides

00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:14,600
I other oh if you're coming all the way

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:24,000
from my activity what I'm horrified

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:28,580
because of these pies cluster cluster

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,470
priority this was voting faster

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,830
distillation out that's not really

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:47,790
though everything as it still not as in

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:52,860
this formation I'm fault will users in

00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:56,940
an adverse decision so judges are syntax

00:32:52,860 --> 00:33:00,770
for inserting whoa hold on I mean once a

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:03,480
day yes I've actually started I know it

00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,460
didn't inserts are faster but I've

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,190
actually disabled them in my dumps

00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,530
because if I need actually we had a

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:13,650
disaster recovery scenario and I had to

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:16,200
compare the dumps and diff does not work

00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:19,050
with extended inserts it doesn't work

00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,179
very well yeah and another reason it

00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:30,299
would be

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:30,299
that's not much so let's say you posted

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,559
I understand our extend format

00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:49,090
or you can come down with that tap and

00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:49,090
just have either capital box

00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:03,980
I is handy but they'd remember why I

00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:07,280
work you're getting ready to be there so

00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:11,390
I pointed out we may be basically strip

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:16,070
off the Indian flag and we use that

00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:24,340
ticket so there's no way to specify in

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:24,340
my zone that's our position that files

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:47,240
um so there's number showing very

00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:55,790
signature cables show storage engines

00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:55,790
change anyway many of those UV use the

00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:12,270
same again mine useful is your scripting

00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:20,520
comes out these are often i will go to

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:26,250
our clients or but again so this

00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:36,299
last tag there is a truck it's shorting

00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:44,329
for friday so both knew I say describe

00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:48,270
see it just a bentley polyps incision

00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:50,970
but it doesn't tell me what store you

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,680
did it doesn't tell me where the X is it

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:57,589
isn't

00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:03,470
the hair I'm scribe just a slide because

00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:03,470
we actually do show create a

00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,650
so here

00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:40,670
I sky and shortstop instances you

00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:45,860
flushed logs watch cable or push the

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:52,640
produce begin to kill sessions there are

00:36:45,860 --> 00:37:07,640
hanging passwords the most potent combo

00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:11,300
tamas kassey just mention that so so my

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:19,100
smoke release was the transactional call

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:23,540
the Bible and the binary log is created

00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:28,220
at the server automatic recorded so

00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:31,100
indeed x.x Sumter National Veterans the

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:35,330
myself my name log is a connection walk

00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:41,150
across or so according to get sorted we

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:43,990
track all you know if you need to Logan

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,990
see what I

00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:03,720
so the ventilation duct verification

00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:12,950
automatically so why don't we well what

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:17,819
means is you can see where you don't eat

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:21,390
so we let you go either one buy it off

00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:24,089
you specified illicit or it assessed by

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:27,630
time and we will dump that information

00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:31,710
out the luggage you can apply to maybe

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:34,950
dessert back to me sick so let you know

00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,809
the classic problem where's unwanted or

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:41,099
drop stages and everyone

00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:45,189
also live videos how do you beat that

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,650
began to back up and you have you have

00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:50,589
to find your blog you can fly back up

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:55,900
hit by your boss up until that time the

00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:59,170
top and you just say it's a guy yes Finn

00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:02,109
logs include queries or only writes with

00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:09,039
that bin moms just quit are joining

00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:12,729
others only in survey of those left he

00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:16,029
absolutely needs track selects their

00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:18,150
gentle walk which is he going on next

00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:20,829
shot will never work good point unless

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:29,170
you have lots of this face in my hands

00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:32,289
into space out there is a software which

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:35,650
is gonna suck each may use probably more

00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:42,249
into development but it's also a useful

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:44,999
crush what you can do I think homeschool

00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:49,080
kids actually immune to this is

00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:53,340
especially about or I should

00:39:49,080 --> 00:40:06,870
sure you tip the software you are on you

00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:09,590
said the long time the timer so 45th

00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:12,840
retro mountain 0 into hotel operators

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:16,380
yessir and then there's a fool to

00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:25,890
analyze data that's how often a bird is

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:27,930
run on what the times are or we if you

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:32,250
have support advice well we have a

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:36,660
monitoring tool that also so you

00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,970
basically try all observers Korea and

00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,900
we'll get mass graphs and results

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:48,930
attitudes where the most call back this

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:54,300
is an app especially theater about not a

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:57,500
snapshot I want to point out some other

00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:04,140
utility for to the packages a little bit

00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:08,280
so committee will isn't one or work it

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:11,300
to Betsy mortgage so we're connection

00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,160
comes with happiness

00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:20,010
if you're going menus in New Year's

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:29,930
shirts / boy this is what's all the work

00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:32,490
is anybody working students questions so

00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:38,400
usually the repellent they're really I

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:42,360
found the source of the GPL license we

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,010
have set up bejine 502 double shift with

00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:56,420
each other so that people can write

00:41:44,010 --> 00:42:01,680
their own jokes these provide with hatch

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:07,320
and to sit a listener with a couple

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:10,040
examples of planning a solid in the

00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,540
usual the bed so there's been quite

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:16,840
unusual replication

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:22,690
administration rotation especially good

00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:26,560
lets you sanely fail or anything or from

00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:28,890
a secure website fall fashions of you to

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,340
do something the last shirt is equated

00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:36,490
cleanly and also an auto Pharaoh utility

00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:39,880
watch replication apology and if you run

00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:43,990
by sex and using connection at these in

00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,740
water available the masculine is our

00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:53,230
battle to commence a redirect all states

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:56,560
to study math or I think this is what it

00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:59,790
was like run this right the veil utility

00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,790
will not do the actual

00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:18,430
which is it is beautiful each other so

00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:23,690
can use a set up a set Tyson pretty

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:27,040
elaborate privileges tables privileges

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,040
and we just be able

00:43:31,060 --> 00:44:13,100
there's 100 better hitter login and

00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:15,880
password and then in this case I am

00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:20,140
basically looking for any object that

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,140
has come to the beach

00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:49,390
but you can see you've got to go from

00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:49,390
the city as how it has code or language

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:58,910
and country language table at the nih

00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:04,090
kalo aku do you need to know and you

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:08,030
have a basis versus it is better crack

00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:11,150
you can specify to the table to you this

00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:26,240
is best part about whether it's table

00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:43,610
columns to this my shortlist work so

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:52,360
just another way to export here so might

00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:55,700
as well s work does that

00:45:52,360 --> 00:46:06,110
but you can ask what about which is

00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:11,210
steamer and data for today in this case

00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:15,040
work hey today's I'm worried about it

00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,040
was something about this

00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:46,360
but you know we also have to work any

00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:49,700
cramps ever exactly because that is

00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,920
which is happening so if you want to fit

00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:54,680
this again and we'll be doing a surf

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,890
along with all these rights the

00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:09,490
schematics worked out a topology all

00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:09,490
users accessing public mission itself

00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:28,509
before Mussina was everything by the

00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:32,920
corner scheming by God is really global

00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:35,799
mostly developers port bad math English

00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,199
its schema that that development

00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:42,410
engineer growth so that base or get

00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:45,739
tracking metrics and they just decided

00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:49,939
to make it a database available all but

00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:51,709
if you go look at five wanna see if you

00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:54,010
can they have helped out in the

00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:57,200
otherwise afford

00:47:54,010 --> 00:48:00,770
new Texas spin locks and it's down to

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:08,190
the nitty-gritty occur in 56 mins

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:13,770
56 the performance tema services DBA so

00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:20,190
you can figure out what we're using what

00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:24,870
coming to us and you basically set up

00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:30,140
forms in the traveler information if I

00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:34,790
doesn't look for what is the biggest

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:38,490
private constant so those days it's a

00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:43,410
review on every table in sir so it

00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:45,120
doesn't actually put me on chance it

00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:50,130
doesn't have a big performance in fact

00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:54,420
as you did my hat but if any easier to

00:48:50,130 --> 00:49:00,750
use one of our engineering guys

00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:03,030
the road was all porn scene helper in is

00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:10,530
available as I went to go inside the

00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:12,920
gallery on the beauty creates a better

00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,920
shine

00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:36,449
off

00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:43,199
so here you see periods 05 first issue

00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:47,900
the worst for Paris business standard

00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,900
analysis gives with errors or warnings

00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:56,400
second easily for which is most

00:49:54,089 --> 00:50:00,599
problematic Reuters what are they doing

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,809
what kind of table 3 I wanted a long

00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:13,829
who's one of them all information on the

00:50:03,809 --> 00:50:18,410
scheme so / come action has to look into

00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:23,369
that lockable maybe you sleep all market

00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:26,299
there was another rescue all utilities

00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:26,299
get some

00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:41,119
once our country it is very good in a

00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:43,589
very helpful information regarding this

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:54,720
recognition you can get it did one

00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:57,750
master slave is how they are very good

00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,420
years passed another you wear out

00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:08,250
something called common scheme so uh

00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:12,240
Johnny Rockets about this guy over the

00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:15,089
hand so Thomas steamed up its time i'll

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:19,710
describe but if you need to do with us

00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:23,970
you'll find it varies so it's kind of a

00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:25,950
working of running a bash script to

00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:28,680
refute leave out a single command and

00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:31,890
jade friends or just using the comma

00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:36,390
seen as you say you can you into the

00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:39,210
comedy know that simplified DDA

00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:42,200
operations I visit power described

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:45,890
that's why I put it there

00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:50,210
go to look at on see what they do yes

00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:53,450
great examples on how to use it but it's

00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:55,910
just again it's got the merging of shell

00:51:53,450 --> 00:52:03,710
scripts will keep your hands within

00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:06,020
other dates and my last one of my very

00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:14,150
favorite Jews who runs thank you very

00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:16,430
much besides if you were responsible to

00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:19,420
my school and you have the test versions

00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:26,810
where you have to test preparation that

00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:30,700
this degrades it's a few times so we'll

00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:38,800
sandbox you can say master you say

00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:38,800
topology and files all you do is

00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:55,350
what version one use so people talking

00:52:49,830 --> 00:53:00,990
about participation sorry he wanted you

00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:04,950
to test out 5656 download party shoes

00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:08,130
you put is optimized well that's it

00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:11,190
there's nothing temporary let's it work

00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,800
without by seven you got a little by

00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:17,040
seven we put it off I feel like I said

00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,860
you can just say may save knox i set and

00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,620
people go with us any person with

00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,690
utilities there and it also became my

00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,970
bathroom privileges everything is in

00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:30,180
here brunch it runs in your home right

00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:34,370
in London New Year's I do you start a

00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:34,370
psychical strips you can use that sir

00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:38,189
but it's all

00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,590
you

00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,440
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,690
ago we could not have imagined that

00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,880
asterisk would not only become the most

00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:17,010
widely adopted open source communication

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,050
software on the planet but that it would

00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,570
impact the entire industry in the way

00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,550
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:26,190
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:28,140
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,240
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,650
transition of power from the hands of

00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,930
the traditional proprietary phone

00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:36,300
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,250
administrators of phone systems using

00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,480
this power our customers have created

00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,430
all sorts of business changing

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,260
applications from small office phone

00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:45,780
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,400
the international carrier networks in

00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:49,170
fact there's even an entire country

00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,780
those communications infrastructure runs

00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,700
on esters the gym has always been about

00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,410
creating technology that expands

00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,570
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,950
we could never have imagined and that's

00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,800
part of what's game-changing about the

00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:04,050
gym today we're doing it again this time

00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,150
by introducing a new family of HD IP

00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,430
phones that extends control of the user

00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,200
all the way to the desktop the launch of

00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:11,720
these new products represents the next

00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,340
phase indigenous history of innovation

00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,320
these are the first and only IP phones

00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,910
designed to fully leverage the power of

00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,530
Astra's when we first discussed our

00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,330
expectations for building a family of

00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,490
phones for use with asterisk our

00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,230
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,850
the team to build the phones such that

00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,070
they were easy to install integrate

00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,900
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:33,480
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,100
that goal user feedback is validating

00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,230
that when it comes to operation with

00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,630
astro space systems including our own

00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:42,210
Switchvox based product these are the

00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,530
easiest to use best integrated most

00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,110
interoperable products on the market

00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:48,110
today the digitally phones will

00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:50,160
initially include three IP des hommes

00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:52,110
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,970
asterisk or switch box based solution

00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,640
these phones are different for a number

00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:59,280
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,720
designed for use with esters secondly

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,330
we've made it really easy to

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,740
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:06,420
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,130
to access information inside of

00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,819
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,339
between an application and the

00:57:09,819 --> 00:57:14,499
all additionally we've created an

00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:16,630
applications engineer that allows users

00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:19,839
and developers to create and run their

00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:21,640
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,589
done all of this at a very compelling

00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,269
price point at Digium we're always

00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:27,369
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:29,890
the best value in business phone systems

00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:31,479
and also give them the power to create

00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,609
their own solutions or any

00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:35,349
communications challenge well continue

00:57:33,609 --> 00:57:36,759
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:38,829
Astra's cooler faster and more

00:57:36,759 --> 00:57:40,449
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:42,910
asterisk employed communications even

00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:46,619
easier and together we'll change the way

00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:46,619
the world communicates again

00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,430
most enterprises today realize that

00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,080
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:00,450
enough to keep their networks saved from

00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,520
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:04,560
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,690
popular lately that adds that extra

00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,359
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,130
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,320
know is that some two-factor

00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:15,540
authentication solutions they're better

00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:18,570
than others like two-factor strong

00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,849
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,830
beyond other authentication systems by

00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:25,890
being less expensive easier to implement

00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:28,349
and easier to use giving software-based

00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:31,230
token clients built to run on all major

00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:33,800
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:36,150
Android these tokens utilize a

00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,369
public/private key combination that's

00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:40,500
generated and on device so there aren't

00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:43,020
any shared secrets flying around or

00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,869
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,730
special handling instead all keys are

00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:50,220
kept secure and private between the

business critical systems humming along

00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:45,300
requires insight into what they're doing

00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:47,250
your system metrics tells stories

00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:49,260
stories that can reveal performance

00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,600
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,160
other problems but how do you keep an

00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,800
eye on all of your systems performance

00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,860
metrics in real-time and record this

00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,600
data for later analysis enter longview

00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,610
the new way to see what's really going

01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,770
on under the hood the long view

01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,840
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:09,300
of all your systems providing you with a

01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,660
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:15,240
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,010
load and network usage click a specific

01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,410
system to access its individual

01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:21,920
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:24,330
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,010
comprehensive network data including

01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:28,320
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:29,880
available on the network tab and disk

01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,800
rights and free space on the disk

01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,650
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:37,170
displays usage statistics for individual

01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:39,360
processes the system info tab shows

01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,580
listening services active connections

01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,740
and available updates adding long view

01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,420
to a system is easy just click the

01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,580
button copy the one line installation

01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,010
command then run the command on your

01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:51,720
linux system to complete the process the

01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:53,910
agent will begin collecting data and

01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,740
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:58,290
start rolling

01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:00,660
use longview to gain visibility into

01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:04,400
your servers so when your website or app

01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,400
heats up it stays up

01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:14,740
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,900
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:20,380
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:24,210
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:27,670
happening in open source the

01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:29,500
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:31,630
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,609
these are these you know these these

01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:35,890
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:38,770
discovered and then fixed is it I think

01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:41,770
that really shows the power of the of

01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:44,220
the open source community it is global

01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:47,770
and it's definitely because of the users

01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:53,650
community people are extremely friendly

01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:55,450
and always ready to help if you go an

01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,609
entire see any day you'll see these guys

01:01:55,450 --> 01:02:00,310
helping each other out and they're all

01:01:57,609 --> 01:02:01,990
doing it like in a selfless manner the

01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:05,010
product is transparent for everyone

01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:08,200
everyone can look at the code base

01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:10,410
everyone can see how close that is being

01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:15,910
built nothing nothing is proprietary

01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:18,520
everything is open in many ways it's

01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:23,020
absolutely vital to the the unborn

01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:27,220
health card stack the most exciting

01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:30,050
event in recent memory for me was our

01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:32,690
first developer boot camp

01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:35,330
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:39,290
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:43,490
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:46,310
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:48,860
chairs in the room twice everything

01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:52,100
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:55,160
is open source and so I don't think that

01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:56,930
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,960
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:02,660
computing and so i think it's i think

01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,010
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,150
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:10,700
talking about open source cloud

01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:13,730
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:15,860
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:20,120
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:22,820
in each data centers these hardware is

01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:26,300
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:29,000
to handle number one that mass scale

01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:32,180
number two it's designed to handle the

01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,730
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:39,230
deployments started working on cloud

01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:42,530
tech over four years ago and it was the

01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:44,270
original set of people working on it had

01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:48,380
a background of delivering software

01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:52,610
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:56,240
lots of users actually using it high

01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:59,330
availability is the key feature multiple

01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:01,340
hypervisors support different network

01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:04,010
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:06,260
you better while step management server

01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:09,980
can be deployed in different physical

01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:11,630
machines it definitely has a huge

01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:16,610
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:19,190
there's a major movie studio that they

01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:22,490
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:24,470
to transcode video and i thought that

01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,120
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:29,390
more fascinating is what they did during

01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:32,180
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:33,530
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,130
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:36,250
the instance

01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:39,650
isn't it back to doing real work

01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:41,180
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,039
different aspects and there's no one

01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:45,680
person that's kind of like a master of

01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:49,490
all those realms I think clouds stack as

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:51,710
a project is going to be one of the

01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:55,789
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:04:51,710 --> 01:05:01,220
most feature fallen and and robust

01:04:55,789 --> 01:05:04,119
platforms out they learn Adam senior
