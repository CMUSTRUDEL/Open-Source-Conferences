the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
at the 2013 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,860
charlotte north carolina it is licensed

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,509
under a creative commons license for

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,190
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,949
linux fest visit w WC selinux phase or

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,810
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,000
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,910
2013 for helping make these videos

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,410
possible this is a talk on user

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:36,239
administration trips up tips and tricks

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,530
jr. dbas for under these problems senior

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,690
DBA are in these problems let me start

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,820
off with the normal oracle safe harbor

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,820
agreement once again if i'm talking

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,340
about something that we haven't actually

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,170
shifted a product if it's in a DMR are

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,780
like mysql 57 if i say it's blue that

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,460
might mean robin's egg blue to you might

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,730
mean cobalt blue to me and ends up being

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,080
some other shade of color so take stuff

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,070
on new features through the grain of

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,909
salt okay a reading from the book of

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,670
mysql mysql stores accounts in the user

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,890
table of the mysql database an account

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,080
is defined in terms of a user name and

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,240
the client host or host from which user

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,340
can connect to the server the account

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,630
may also have a password not exactly

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,820
extremely reassuring for the security

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,979
folks okay most people in the linux

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,369
world when they get on last q all they

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,540
tape mysql in the database name and

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:43,049
mysql is smart enough to take the

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,439
username as the username connecting to

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:50,130
the database in many cases this is good

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,470
i really don't recommend it it's there

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,790
for convenience i like to lock things

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,860
down a little bit further but that I've

00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,110
come from a weird security government

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:04,140
background you can usually override what

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,969
your account is with the minus you so

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,229
you do MySQL minus u the username you

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,510
want to use and away you go they can be

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,120
up to 16 characters long we have our

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,299
little

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,810
encryption algorithm and we do support

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:21,159
alternative character sets had some

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:26,560
admonitions about character sets

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:31,030
yesterday can go over those later but if

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,400
you need the serbian dialect with the

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:39,159
serbian to collation we support it and

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,440
it's out there okay creating accounts

00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,060
when you create a council asked you well

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,060
there's usually two ways you can do it

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:52,359
you can use a create user or you can use

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,180
a grant statement the second one which

00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,620
is really firs only the real diehards

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,709
who love typing you can actually get

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,290
into the MySQL table database and into

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,030
the user table and insert that stuff

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,849
real messy error-prone don't do that

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:12,159
please use a GUI like MySQL workbench or

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:18,280
something like PHP myadmin doing it by

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:21,730
hand a top line there we log into mysql

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,750
as user root by the way root password do

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,880
not make it the same as the root

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,340
password in your linux boxes unless

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,410
you're a one-man shop if you're multiple

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,099
person shop you don't want to be giving

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,290
away your root passwords anyway create a

00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,840
user here we have a user named Joe who's

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,940
coming in at localhost by the way

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,060
wildcards look like either an underlying

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,980
or the % so we're creating user Joe

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,959
Oklahoma denti fide by a password

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,400
something else you can do is grant all

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:57,549
privileges on database table to Joe a

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,810
local host with grant option be very

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,940
careful with this if you give someone

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,139
grant option that means they get to go

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,840
around and grant themselves their own

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,090
privileges works great in small shops

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,769
does not work in medium sized shops does

00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:15,129
not work on chops and shops with big

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:17,139
egos okay you can also do a create user

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,979
and then come back and give that person

00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,750
privileges if you want to be very very

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:26,560
very specific of what you're doing for a

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:30,520
user you can grant reload and

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,540
process privileges on a database table

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:41,830
to admin at a host or we can just do a

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:43,389
create user dummy at localhost okay what

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,450
happens out over a couple years that

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,250
your average shop is you hire a guy

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,180
named Joe you fire a guy named Joe you

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,620
bring another guy named Joe Joe get

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,169
certain privileges someone else come

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,840
named Joe comes in Joe can't log in one

00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,700
day so you go through the user table and

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,530
some of these there's 15 entries for Joe

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,200
always slightly different offset

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:08,020
privileges as I mentioned on this slide

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,070
usually find out your boss Joe working

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,960
from home does not have the same

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,660
privileges as he's doing his year and

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,010
review of all the employees tends to

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,200
upset your bosses when they don't have

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,610
the same privileges unfortunately

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,050
there's no good tools for auditing this

00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,590
right now so you have to go through it

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:28,450
by hand I need to write a script for

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:32,350
that something else you'll see if you go

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:36,340
to a strange box and you go to use the

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,760
my SQL table you select user host and

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,729
password from the user table and you'll

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,930
see route from local hosts with this

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:51,010
password route from 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:55,000
one at this password you'll see root at

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,760
a IP version 6 address thankfully the

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,780
same password and then you see a blank

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,700
under user and a blank password that's

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,169
what we come to call an anonymous

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:10,510
account if you can get rid of it please

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,000
do it's a big security bug if you do

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,880
have an anonymous account out there take

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,530
away every privilege you can from it in

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,060
some shops you have it out there because

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,260
someone needs to comment on to a quick

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,800
and dirty and look up something real

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,419
fast but if you come in and you are in

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,750
charge of a box you want to lock it down

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:33,630
first thing to look for or anonymous

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,630
again anonymous account

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,050
now on every row for a user you'll see

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:44,270
the username password and a host like

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,540
you saw and then you'll see a whole

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,550
bunch of little columns what are those

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,520
columns well the various privileges you

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:56,240
can get on the box select insert update

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,660
etc these allow you to manipulate data

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,410
and tables depending how many in which

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,020
you have in certain combinations be

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:14,590
careful some of these like create

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:18,380
tablespace create temp table and others

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,480
for a vindictive user or somewhat that

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,550
they can actually flood the disk drives

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:29,300
on your mysql server great denial of

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:32,390
service route trick there the other

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,200
thing you'll see is encryption you can

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,910
encrypt your MySQL traffic you can also

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,590
limit the number of questions the number

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,720
of updates the number of connections and

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,110
the number of user connections how many

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,700
times then actually log in to a box so

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,070
if you have a real workout sentient user

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:56,150
and you want them on for one time for

00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:00,110
one query once a day you can do it very

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:05,710
very rarely done now new as of five six

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:10,010
are plugins an authentication string and

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,980
expiring a password in the past a lot of

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,500
government agencies have shied away from

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,400
MySQL because it doesn't have password

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,560
control we now have that in 56 and 57 if

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,030
you do a fresh install it will force you

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,380
to put in a root password we're in the

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,310
past you can kind of get away with a

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,310
quick carriage return

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:36,909
pluggable authentication now when you're

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,560
trying to login and the client comes

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,880
through and system seasons there's

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,700
actually a plug-in that you're supposed

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,779
to be referencing it will see what that

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,560
plug-in is if it specifies the plug-in

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,640
it hands it off to the server that

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,070
actually running that a little shared

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,510
libraries doing that the plugin will

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,640
watch return of status indicating

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,700
whether the user is permitted to connect

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,910
or not now with an external

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:07,300
authentication you know things like ldap

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,000
pam windows authentication make it more

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,670
of your bigger security package it's no

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,710
longer konica lone wolf out there we

00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:19,089
also introduced with 56 proxy users used

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,290
to be you got a new user who had to use

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,150
the database you had to have a new

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,410
account form well if you have an

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,240
accounting department and they're always

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,670
hiring and firing folks it's easier to

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,500
set up one general accounting record

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,839
that has all the privileges the

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,510
accounting folks need and then you just

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:40,360
give a proxy login for the new temp

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:42,670
accountant so what sort of plugins do we

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,110
have well on the right hand side we have

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,580
the native plug-in which everyone's been

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:53,140
using for a long time 256 Shah clear

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,970
text socket pier and a test so if you

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,980
want to write your own you can go with

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,050
the test and see what you need to do to

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,280
step your own now if you're an

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,520
enterprise customer meaning you're

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,530
actually paying for MySQL we give you

00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,290
the plugins for Pam windows and

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,839
enterprise audit if any of you are doing

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,870
PCI compliance and you've had a hard

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,940
time passing your audits take a look at

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,250
the audit it does basically what the

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,100
Oracle audit does it works with the

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,910
Oracle audit vault and it's great for

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,910
credit cards

00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:29,449
so as I mentioned earlier on the with

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,269
the accounting example here we should

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:34,759
come through and say okay create user

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:38,329
user at whatever host identified with

00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:42,379
that plug in and say that they're going

00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:46,100
to be an accountant and create that user

00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:47,299
away you go very simple one-step you

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,239
don't have to set up an account for

00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:55,459
everybody and much easier so what other

00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:57,169
things can you lock down with MySQL well

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,049
you can lock it down to the database

00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:03,019
level which we had the example where you

00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:05,149
create you grant user star dot star that

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,100
means star means everything we're going

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,959
to say a counting dot star which means

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,359
everything in the accounting table or

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,549
accounting dodge receivables that will

00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:16,730
you lock them down to that one table

00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:18,410
within that one database we can also do

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,410
it to the table level I have just

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,149
mentioned the column level so if you

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,069
want the purchasing folks to be able to

00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,839
see what the vendors name is and their

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,929
phone number is you can do that and lock

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:34,749
everyone else out of there we can also

00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:36,769
lock down events mysql has suffered

00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:39,379
horribly on some very bad

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,480
implementations of chron on boxes so we

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:44,629
came up with our own cron like thing

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,309
that we call events stored procedures

00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:47,629
are kind of like sub programs that you

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:52,149
write yourself you put in there we can

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,149
lock those down and functions

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:03,540
so here's an example where we granted to

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:06,270
some user at some host everything all

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:10,830
privileges on this database to this

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:14,310
table and we can also say okay this

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,990
person at this host they can select and

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:22,470
they can insert they cannot do anything

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:27,209
like a delete or a drop on this

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:29,370
databases and this table by the way if

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:34,020
you're new to mysql and new to being a

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,670
DBA this pair of words down here at the

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,070
bottom will be the bane of your

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,190
existence for a while all the

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,540
information is stored in memory tables

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,950
so if you're typing along you're trying

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,260
to set up somebody's account and you

00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,110
type in grant all to jhatch MoDOT

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,899
whatever and go try it and then come

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,820
back say it's not working what happened

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,950
is you have not typed flush privileges

00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,029
which is told the system to reload the

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,980
grant table you're laughing every senior

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,390
DBA has done this at least twice a year

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,950
since they've been playing with mysql

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,570
and junior dba's and it's them a lot

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:12,870
more often something else you can do is

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,690
grant select on column one insert on

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,180
column one column two on this database

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,380
table this is a good way to really

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,380
really lock things down

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:35,800
once again every junior dba's bane of

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:36,999
their distance see you there I've had

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,879
people tell me I shouldn't do this but

00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:44,230
most audiences seem to appreciate it so

00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,779
if you don't like it let me know so

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,399
other database systems you say okay I'm

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,769
going to set someone up as a DBA what

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,970
privileges I just hit the DBA switch in

00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,790
a way they have all the privileges for

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,360
that MySQL does not have any predefined

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,670
ideas like that you can set it up by

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,939
hand using an insert command once again

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:08,139
I recommend last kill workbench PHP

00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:09,220
myadmin does a reasonably good job work

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:10,620
bencher if you want to see a demo of

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,360
that I can do that a little bit later

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,670
what's great this has predefined rules

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,459
for DBA user admin design and

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,949
replication you can also send things

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:38,290
down to the table and column level if

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:42,100
you need to could using proxies give you

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,899
that idea of rules yes unfortunately we

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,149
don't have any predefined ones so you'd

00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:51,699
have to define them and then define the

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:53,319
reference person as a proxy yeah use

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:55,420
workbench to set up something for an

00:14:53,319 --> 00:15:02,230
accounting person and then reference the

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:05,019
other people to that big rule to junior

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,920
admins be stingy on handing out

00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:10,839
privileges because someone needs a quick

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,179
and dirty truncate or drop table

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,519
permission because a quick project

00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:16,779
they're doing now does not mean that six

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,059
months from now right before you go off

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,980
to a Thanksgiving dinner that they don't

00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:24,759
drop the entire system database at the

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,249
wrong time it's sometimes easier to do

00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,939
things for people then hand them the

00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:32,679
privileges and forget about it by the

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,990
way that's the way reason you do backups

00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:37,430
regularly and frequently

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,350
other things that happens is you give

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,769
someone privileges to write temp tables

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,940
or write stuff out and they're not sure

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,170
where it's running up and suddenly your

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,490
machine start swapping because it's

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,040
running out of disk space and there's

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,149
little temp files and other things that

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,519
aren't being done the system starts

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:58,730
thrashing badly so be very very careful

00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:01,810
yes sir I've been in chops for either

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,810
one of them could be the DBA

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,929
one thing I used to do when I was a DBA

00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:17,839
or a consultant as I'd go through on a

00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:20,599
regular basis and dump everything into

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,720
XL and play various games and find out

00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:26,689
who had grant privilege who had dropped

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,749
privilege and just swish with short

00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:31,899
through there it's also nice to know

00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:34,099
especially who has shut down privilege

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,229
you'll be surprised to have someone

00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:42,259
reading something in a magazine will sad

00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:47,149
gee I wonder if I have that privilege it

00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:50,449
happens something else you can look at

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,949
as triggers triggers work on events like

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:53,569
someone goes to drop something and you

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:56,149
have a trigger says okay they're getting

00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:57,409
rid of this row I have a dummy table

00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,239
over here they don't know about I'm just

00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:01,999
going to copy that data over there

00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:04,870
without them knowing it it might be a

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:08,419
millisecond or to delay in the overall

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:10,069
aggregate of things but when you find

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:11,779
out that they just dropped 50,000

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,639
records from your accounts payable and

00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:19,159
the accountants aren't happy it's easier

00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:22,250
to suck it back something that also

00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:25,819
might interest some of you time delay in

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,970
replication we learned this trick from

00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,980
Flickr someone calls us this oh my god i

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:35,840
just deleted all my pictures of grandma

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:38,389
and they're the only pictures we have we

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,610
don't have from the originals because

00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:42,830
they got burned down last week got to

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,570
help us what flickr was doing is they

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,840
wrote their own time delay so that if

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,639
you caught it within 24 hours they could

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,259
easily just scooped stuff half off a

00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:55,850
replica so if you have data that you

00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:59,350
don't want to have to literally pull off

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,580
tape set up time to delayed replication

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,340
the other thing is replication is you

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,590
don't have to replicate everything the

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,509
more serious tables that you need keep

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,269
them out there if you have stuff that

00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:13,159
changes like a order catalog that you

00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,409
don't really publish more than once a

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,669
quarter maybe you only backed it up on

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:18,879
tape and don't worry about replicating

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,879
it

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,260
okay summary remember flush privileges

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,790
when my when you go in to log into mysql

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,350
the first thing it does is it checks to

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,000
make sure your host is on the whitelist

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,260
and then it checks the user and password

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,350
from then on it looks for plugins and

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,760
proxies you can lock down more than the

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,460
table level you can actually go down to

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,070
the column level once again i highly

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,820
recommend workbench it's free it's works

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:59,230
great it's free does everything you you

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:04,810
really need and big admonition be stingy

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:06,070
with proves every so every DB I've known

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,560
that has a little bit of a tinge of

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,170
being an sob tends to keep their job

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,820
more than the kind-hearted extremely

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:18,040
liberal database administration whom

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,770
let's everybody have every privilege I

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,680
should have asked my friends from Sky to

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,870
come in here this is the thing that mati

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,790
when anus says he never sees this is

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,600
what last few else plan to do the next

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:34,140
18 24 36 months with the product we're

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,840
going to make it more web and cloud

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:43,060
centric we're making a more pluggable

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:46,140
architecture think of pipes and similar

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:48,960
things in the command line of Linux

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,740
we're going to have more no SQL options

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,530
we're going to get a true data

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,860
dictionary which if you're doing cross

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:58,120
database joins make things a lot faster

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,240
we're doing more work with the SSD

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,310
providers and we're going to have to GIS

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,020
and sometimes later the summer you

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,660
should see some information on charting

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,140
the Mickey all very happy for you folks

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,600
you're trying to do the next Facebook if

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,980
you need to learn more on mysql please

hit my school com downloads are out of

entire community at Planet Lasky all

00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,340
very interesting tool and well worth the

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:58,570
cost of the subscription enterprise

bay for the America's Cup if you haven't

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,980
seen these things doing 45 knots across

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:46,930
the water just literally feet away from

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:49,530
the Embarcadero it's quite a thrill if

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,480
you know or if you want to learn mysql

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:56,350
cheaply and elegantly and have your work

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,450
checked by mozilla stop DBA the Boston

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,570
mysql meetup run something called MySQL

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,060
marinade they do a chapter a week of the

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,980
learning mysql book they're halfway

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,380
through their second batch the first

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,900
time they did it they had 85 86 people

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,500
sign up to take the class right now

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,420
they're in week 5 if you want to

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,890
scrambling catch up because the first

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,820
couple chapters have minimal homework

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,250
and the chapters 3 and 4 have maybe five

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,700
or six questions it's great way to learn

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,410
mysql they have an online chat group and

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,900
if you're in the boston area they get

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:37,210
together and chat I think by weekly at a

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:39,260
coffeehouse once again thanks for coming

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,960
out I'm Dave Stokes

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,160
I'm David Stokes at oracle com if you

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,360
need to get ahold of me and you can't

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,160
figure can't remember what I said here

00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:52,700
slides are in slideshare net / Dave

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,860
Stokes on twitter i'm at stoker once

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,350
again warning there's a movie starring

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,210
nicole kidman named Stoker that's

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,410
getting vert its independent when we see

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,840
it's released around the country

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:05,330
differently so if you see anything

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,950
really exciting going on at Stoker's in

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,950
there it's probably not me unfortunately

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,870
but i want to thank thank you all for

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,510
coming out i'm glad you folks are making

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,310
use of this 02 DBA track we'll see if we

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,830
can expand it next year and I'd like to

00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,830
open it up to questions yes sir

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:54,460
ok when you recommend as far as best

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,800
practices best for repeating for the

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,530
camera since you know them I from best

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,650
practices for infrastructure for dbas

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,710
and a shop run the latest version of

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:09,250
MySQL is that you can 56 has a lot of

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:13,240
great things out there they have tools

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,950
like MySQL workbench if you're really

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,600
serious about it go out and buy the

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,840
subscription so you get the tools like

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,250
Enterprise monitor the query analyzer so

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,430
if something does go wrong and they're

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,260
writing in PHP net or Java you can

00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,970
actually figure out what lines of code

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,310
are going bad and take it over to the

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:34,000
developer and say this is bad don't do

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:37,330
this other thing is make sure you're

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,920
running fairly decent hardware every so

00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,570
often I go into a shop and you can see

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,400
where they've gotten Gladys's from

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,920
accountings hand down box with the

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,520
window Emmy sticker on it and that's the

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:51,220
production database box and generally if

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,350
you have that and some sort of caffeine

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,010
you can keep a DBA happy for literally

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,010
years on end

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:08,670
my take of MySQL on a vm Amazon seems

00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:09,929
quite happy with it I played with a

00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,030
little bit my trouble is I'm an

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:14,790
old-fashioned DBA I like to know where

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,760
my data is and the idea that it could be

00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:21,540
in cincinnati one day in Phoenix the

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,760
next day kind of worries me the thing is

00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,470
it's like a Kleenex if you need a spin

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,600
up a database and something goes wrong

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,880
you wat it up and throw it away that's

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,620
wonderful if it's something under

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,250
sarbanes-oxley in the government saying

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,830
you need to keep this for 50 years not

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,480
so much I think you're going to see more

00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,160
and more hybrids where your marketing

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
stuff is out there on some sort of

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,510
virtual server that you don't really

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,370
care about because it's ephemeral you

00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,250
know it's you know the entire sale

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:53,070
lasted 17 minutes and affected 44,000

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:56,760
people in one city don't care about it

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,200
tax records accounting health stuff is

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:06,090
going to be somewhere on a platter you

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:10,590
can go over and trip on so any other

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:14,370
questions well thank you all for for

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,620
coming out and making the 02 DBA track

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,890
very successful and see you back next

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,890
year

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,950
you

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,910
you

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:16,139
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:18,299
way to better utilize all your resources

00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:21,750
and it makes managing all your resources

00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:25,580
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:29,100
happening in open source the

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,899
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,820
of the community and the speed at which

00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,009
these are these you know these

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,320
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,929
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,600
that really shows the power of the you

00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:44,250
know of the open source community it is

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,450
global and it's definitely because of

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:54,779
the users community people are extremely

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:56,549
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,980
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,090
these guys helping each other out and

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,000
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,830
manner the product is transparent for

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,029
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:11,070
base everyone can see how close duck is

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:16,919
is being built nothing nothing is

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:19,559
proprietary everything is open in many

00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,759
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:27,539
unborn health cloudstack the most

00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:31,380
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:34,080
was our first developer boot camp

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,720
and our call gave people I gave you two

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,710
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,940
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,700
with 87 people and had to go get board

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,250
chairs into the room twice everything

00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,490
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,550
is open source and so I don't think that

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:58,320
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,350
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,900
computing and so i think it's i think

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,400
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,540
about cloud computing you're really

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:12,090
talking about open source cloud

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:15,120
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,250
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,510
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,210
in each data center is these hardware is

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:27,690
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:30,390
to handle number one that mass scale

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:33,570
number two it's designed to handle the

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,820
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,660
deployments we started working on

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,990
contact over four years ago and it was

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,660
the original set of people working on it

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:49,770
add a background of delivering software

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:54,030
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:57,630
lots of users actually using it high

00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:00,720
availability is a key feature multiple

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,730
hypervisors support different network

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,400
models you can pick up whatever suits

00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,680
you better while step management server

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,370
can be deployed in different physical

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,020
machines it definitely has a huge

00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:18,000
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:20,580
there's a major movie studio that they

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,880
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,860
to transcode video and i thought that

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,510
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,780
more fascinating is what they did during

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,570
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,740
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,570
lunch was over they would

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,830
all the instances and go back to doing

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:42,330
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,400
so many different aspects and there's no

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:46,770
one person that's kind of like a master

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,850
of all those realms I think cloudstack

00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:53,220
as a project is going to be one of the

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,179
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:02,610
most feature fallen and and robust

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:05,510
platforms out they were I don't senior

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,510
living through the clouds dag

00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,340
you

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,789
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,739
ago we could not have imagined that

00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:32,929
asterisk would not only become the most

00:31:30,739 --> 00:31:35,090
widely adopted open source communication

00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:37,100
software on the planet but that it would

00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,619
impact the entire industry in the way

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,600
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:31:39,619 --> 00:31:44,239
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,190
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:48,289
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,700
transition of power from the hands of

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:51,979
the traditional proprietary phone

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,379
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:56,450
administrators of phone systems using

00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,099
this power our customers have traded all

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,169
sorts of business changing applications

00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:01,970
from small office phone systems to

00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:04,070
mission-critical call centers the

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,899
international carrier networks in fact

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,369
there's even an entire country those

00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:09,830
communications infrastructure runs on

00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,749
esters the gym has always been about

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,460
creating technology that expands

00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:15,649
communications capabilities in ways that

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,820
we could never have imagined and that's

00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:19,220
part of what's game-changing about

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,919
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,019
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,119
IP phones that extends control of the

00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:27,889
user all the way to the desktop the

00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,599
launch of these new products represents

00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:31,700
the next phase indigenous history of

00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,099
innovation these are the first and only

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,809
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,369
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:39,379
our expectations for building a family

00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,539
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:43,279
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,929
the team to build the phones such that

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,119
they were easy to install integrate

00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,979
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,529
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:53,149
that goal user feedback is validating

00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:55,279
that when it comes to operation with

00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:57,710
Astra space systems including our own

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,289
Switchvox based product these are the

00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,580
easiest to use best integrated most

00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:04,159
interoperable products on the market

00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,159
today the digitally of phones will

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,210
initially include three IP des hommes

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,159
uniquely designed to complement any

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,019
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,690
these phones are different for a number

00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:17,359
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,769
designed for use with esters secondly

00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,379
we've made it really easy to

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,789
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:24,470
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,179
to access information inside of

00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,750
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:30,390
between an application and

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:32,550
phone additionally we've created an

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,680
applications engine that allows users

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:37,920
and developers to create and run their

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,690
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,640
done all of this at a very compelling

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,320
price point at Digium we're always

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,420
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,940
the best value in business phone systems

00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,650
and also give them the power to create

00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,690
their own solutions or eating

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,400
communications challenge will continue

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:54,840
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,880
Astra's cooler bastard more

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,500
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,990
asterisk and what communications even

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,700
easier and together we'll change the way

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,700
the world communicates again

00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,260
your customers rely on your website or

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,629
application if it's slower

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,570
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,399
and costs you money keeping your

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,919
business critical systems humming along

00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:29,230
requires insight into what they're doing

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:31,179
your system metrics tells stories

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,190
stories that can reveal performance

00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,530
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,089
other problems but how do you keep an

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,730
eye on all of your systems performance

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:42,760
metrics in real-time and record this

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,530
data for later analysis enter longview

00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,540
the new way to see what's really going

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,700
on under the hood the long view

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,770
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,230
of all your systems providing you with a

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:56,589
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:59,170
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:34:56,589 --> 00:35:00,940
load and network usage click a specific

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,339
system to access its individual

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,849
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:08,260
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,940
comprehensive network data including

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,250
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,809
available on the network tab and disk

00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,730
rights and free space on the disk

00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:18,549
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:21,099
displays usage statistics for individual

00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:23,260
processes the system info tab shows

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:25,510
listening services active connections

00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,640
and available updates adding long view

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,349
to a system is easy just click the

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,480
button copy the one line installation

00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:33,940
command then run the command on your

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,619
linux system to complete the process the

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,809
agent will begin collecting data and

00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:41,319
sending it to longview then the graph

00:35:37,809 --> 00:35:43,569
start rolling use long view to gain

00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,329
visibility into your servers so when

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:48,970
your website or app heats up it stays up

00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:51,250
most enterprises today realize that

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,900
usernames and passwords alone aren't

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,270
enough to keep their network safe from

00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,339
unauthorized intrusions that's my

00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,380
two-factor authentication has gotten so

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:01,510
popular lately that adds that extra

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,150
layer of protection enterprise networks

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,920
need to stay safe but what you may not

00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,140
know is that some two-factor

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,359
authentication solutions they're better

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:13,390
than others like two-factor strong

00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,670
authentication with wicked wicked goes

00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,619
beyond other authentication systems by

00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,680
being less expensive easier to implement

00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:23,170
and easier to use giving software-based

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,020
token clients built to run on all major

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,619
devices and OSS including iOS and

00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,970
Android these tokens utilize a

00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:33,339
public/private key combination that's

00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,319
generated on device so there are any

00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:37,839
shared secrets flying around for

00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,690
attackers to hijack or which require any

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,549
special handling instead all keys are

00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,010
kept secure and private between the

00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:47,200
requesting token and your server which

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,839
you control in house making it the most

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,490
secure way possible to perform

00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,309
authentication encryption and with an

00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:57,099
extensive flexible API and support for

00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:59,049
