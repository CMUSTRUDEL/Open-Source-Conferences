the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280

linux fest visit WWDC linux fest org the

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,619
southeast linux fest would like to thank

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,689
the following diamond sponsors in 2013

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,689
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:53,690
and that's when we most people run I so

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,329
unhappy distribution DeAngelis hardware

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,260
configuration of maxwell to my

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,260
motivation

00:01:48,770 --> 00:02:12,110
okay so like and I'll take care of

00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:15,110
important for crime axwell this year

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Maxwell

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:24,730
seventh grade distribution and what that

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,730
mean the South Beach County support

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:50,360
go console and civility in your honor is

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:54,860
something you want to have changes we

00:02:50,360 --> 00:03:01,840
also want that to be a recent map you

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:06,040
don't want to be crying actual form for

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:10,670
without they especially absolutely heart

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:18,140
you Harbor visit is a born more may

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:21,820
enforce this Numa architecture + 15 he

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:27,140
also had either much food in their

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:31,850
kennels recently and any less tension

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,360
was important to most holy decision to

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,360
my school

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:56,500
verisign Makino's horrible Lena haha

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:59,739
it's all over georgian 20 hi what is

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:07,000
going to Hardware in harmony and take

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:11,110
you a long long way with my school

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,670
around me so lately easy by Community

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:21,040
High not that sort of it let's do you

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:26,650
can go a long way you can have my car

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:31,479
here let's see 64 press picture work

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:34,360
going to weld hotter terra memory you

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:38,350
can apply the story in inside flash you

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,190
should provide a high deposit I it

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,350
allows you to do I hope when ordered

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,020
hard with my stories think about the

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,890
simple where is your verifications are

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,890
using

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:22,120
actually they measure even if you have

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:28,030
to aspire you do today and smoke a

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:37,449
beautiful about 8,000 pages intention

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:45,279
simple Maxwell instant love you I much

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:48,340
work so hard where goes a long way if I

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:55,620
scope is not to save me not so don't

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:55,620
have to use begin to the farm

00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:04,570
so that will be a hardware what they

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,020
were to fall from hunter cpu well i

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:12,070
would say the first and foremost you

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,740
want to go for passports i assume so

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:21,370
many people instead say oh I want to buy

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:25,660
make horse images and that is nothing to

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:30,460
charge extra because many of your pores

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:33,280
of us it'll make it all in the tender

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,040
for comparison the large amount of

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,350
course avoid moving forward all in bed

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,440
with you can actually maintain that

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:46,630
level apart and also the new my squirrel

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:49,660
and a great season in 10 min escape all

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:53,800
those other scores in the majority for

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:58,570
vote I mean even on two sockets of

00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:04,900
policy 846 treasure each you will have

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:08,340
some specific capacity are that there if

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:13,580
we do not need to go to

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:16,860
to work at Mary Mary I would say is

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,470
typically or often the most important

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,180
American culture because various cities

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:27,449
are if you can t amount of data memory

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,960
has to go to his all the lines that even

00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:35,510
in at least six black he can slow things

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:39,180
down so much in her to heaven authority

00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:45,190
so we say words what we work instead

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:49,099
till wed member from sandpoint

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,770
big loser proponents and also understand

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:55,310
good is it good reducing interesting

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:58,280
relationship between memory and highest

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,979
reach the less memory had more cache

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,280
misses you haven't sent right that means

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:08,870
more demand where will be from your

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:12,530
privacy everyone through if you can fit

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:15,159
all your database in memory then after

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:20,560
Norma we won't happen English at all

00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:28,099
because they're using the catch so we're

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:31,400
successful and this is important both

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:34,339
sides for support in some case I see

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:39,229
people in fact a jungle cat amount of

00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:43,490
memory but with fast speed typically

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:52,940
portrayed so sighs illegal stuff and

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:55,940
then the storage the data storage is the

00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:01,220
fastest response you can get big deal

00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:04,490
too heavy a guy's life such as he takes

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:08,290
rest are you can get to denial villains

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,290
now with our guys

00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:15,230
those boxes because you don't have to go

00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,740
through let's say SATA SAS interfaces

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,930
you know try to mechanically our drive

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:25,189
directly to express very late it's very

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:32,059
high performance now at the same time

00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:35,990
then comes to see us out specifics these

00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:38,990
are all very positive in fact I was in

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:43,870
here right now open very comparable in

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:47,959
price to yours hi Stefan updated on

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:54,769
Windows he did gain a BMP 15 each guard

00:09:47,959 --> 00:10:01,550
their clock then what was important in

00:09:54,769 --> 00:10:04,730
the season my vendors and also do some

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,519
way toward for you before performance my

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,569
name is Peter at least spinning media

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,990
instead of the old section estate I even

00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:19,770
put on drives to vendors

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:25,140
and work with I big oversized if it's in

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:28,410
15 RPM 2.5 inches well that'll appear

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,860
that is completely different life where

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:35,850
every single vendor has a terrific

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:39,810
energy grid is a local proprietary and

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:45,029
complication of very tired and the whole

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:50,880
design inside that's quite complicated

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:54,029
East inside and in every culture for

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,899
example 18 soccer gratitude perform well

00:10:54,029 --> 00:11:01,050
that ratio we have garbage collection so

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,080
for maybe six and peer the time we'll go

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:09,649
get very slowly on smaller than they try

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,649
to catch right work is like you want to

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:21,240
you are going for the gold poor grade

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,240
images 0

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:28,970
Porto's you want to use your duties if

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:35,470
you are in the archives note that they

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:38,510
are very slow for rats especially for

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,140
all right and he can get my sponsor

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:44,720
right acknowledgments need to head back

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:51,220
up cash on it which is very important

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,840
for the transaction data so no choice

00:11:51,220 --> 00:12:00,080
always go to that and I would you

00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:06,350
consider season is not an impossible to

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:10,220
say but maybe have an hybrid reality

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:14,420
because the capacitor and applause so we

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,060
had those bought a loaded process the

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,660
living nowadays probably feeling the

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:25,130
sometimes is BB you system for would

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:30,490
have to disabled and knowing and

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,490
training river but discharge regarded

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,139
and then this is needed right that isn't

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:44,689
that what your rate is actually is

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:48,209
detail because a little affair of older

00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:51,389
voters which have been designed for this

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:54,990
be immediate they can't me deal with

00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:58,339
amount of items with my and they

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,980
themselves to be hampered on the body

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:07,199
then look at that very sources i'll take

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:09,930
the 20 10 is the best choice for its

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:15,509
most grateful performance and simple

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:18,120
enough sometimes here let me push to for

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:24,329
example if you he and the Portobello

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:27,500
your grocery part right 10 mins boost to

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:30,660
write a five and that's any feasible for

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:34,620
most applications and especially if you

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,709
can have multiple space so give each you

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,660
know with the stock photography or you

00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:44,880
can pay general or something else

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,810
because your opponents over kind of pale

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:54,690
very hot and with

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:58,470
pro especially reindeer going at the

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:09,390
performance and then god we showed

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:17,030
us the memory we had in this case of

00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:20,010
eating peas the answer is soft their

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:23,490
performance roaster smoker you can set

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,610
the stage of Vietnamese memory three

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:36,710
knocks but performance increase maybe

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:36,710
one into Center so it gives posture

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:47,250
provides us more and more substantial

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:51,170
improvement until the engaged part over

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:55,080
that all our beta pizza with us

00:14:51,170 --> 00:15:01,580
somewhere focus on other dates after

00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:04,580
each side about everybody but now we're

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,580
agency

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:25,630
in two forms for 10 days before we fire

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:30,320
up now Vacation Bible what is it very

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,630
well as Aloha you can always go down fit

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:38,060
all this in a decent amount of memory

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:41,630
and the data side confused bro then you

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:46,280
may end up here with a great size

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:50,990
increases only m % y the purple Davis

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:57,070
can sustain can drop to hop treasure and

00:15:50,990 --> 00:16:01,040
it is a worse scenario so bad because if

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,500
very poor to move toward your system

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,520
understand who you are so you're caught

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,130
bus project pizza just saying this

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:18,730
because the velocity no big changes and

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:23,860
my configuration

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:27,310
their storage memory beach I saw all the

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,959
compression to commentate on is not i

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:34,600
will add number of stories we do the

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:43,240
same page mark will use iowa which is

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:53,920
possible in a certain range and in agra

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:58,149
our slope sort of ancient desert for it

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:03,780
is a pretty much different in this heat

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:08,910
defeated it's a provable 58 in huge iowa

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:15,790
is right now I said we can see their

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:19,329
growth as it go toward more more air is

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:22,270
the differently inhales refugees right

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:29,819
so summer here the difference is watts

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:29,819
and then I need to post this ayah now

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,519
so that's important to understand we'll

00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:41,629
get the impact of the boss George will

00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:44,090
be more significant than whatever its if

00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:47,629
you have and so sometimes your choice

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:56,629
maybe not eaten too much for 75 in

00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:59,779
Quebec is much easier / AP courses in

00:17:56,629 --> 00:18:04,399
computer here then to investor to higher

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:06,980
costs a lot more compared to mine even

00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:13,369
grade level baby plastic out that's a

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:21,610
very important selection have to do and

00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:26,659
I going two moro in specific niche is

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:31,610
alive then is he gone yet alive you want

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:35,419
to hear first what alana that will come

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:42,850
straight there we have raised a monster

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:42,850
kamagra to death ah strike two culture

00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:51,460
68 now when is below the line we are

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,600
seeing is what

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:59,380
to make sure when you said partition all

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,559
this tripod ultimately needle but Allah

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,409
videossubscribe sighs and then we also

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,649
wanted to set up their file system

00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:10,750
alignment ultras to ascribe argument

00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:16,390
reading about this whole different day

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:19,870
so Fox is to know how our race card

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,750
piece and then we can optimize its beta

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:32,830
structure and Iowa you consider how

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:42,279
physically straight I get whatever I

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:45,340
just wanted to share some bedrock and in

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:49,750
some cases especially English speaking /

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,720
I can party Fred his voter Fred he

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:57,220
should know after an artifice they can

00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:03,039
be pretty see needed a game with a nice

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:06,700
line and a line that indicates that envy

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,429
you and our main percent of the whole

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:15,270
operation set especially free no charge

00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:15,270
just by sitting at the Cartesian process

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:25,899
now many thousand at work what a hero

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:33,590
late legacy is a loss support very great

00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:38,190
advice well this kid in there una from

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:41,310
plenty is always important so what that

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:48,540
means is my vacation standpoint we won't

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:51,000
have as many people as possible from

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:54,720
networks and one also means we want to

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,450
minimize our ops within daily lives but

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,480
he has an anchor single seat belt

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:06,380
greater possibly want to minimize that

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,670
as much as possible sometimes active

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:13,800
network we cannot set up a fish

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:17,970
inspiration and physically and go

00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:25,110
through so much tougher superstar Rajini

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:30,510
chem people to the latest get busy with

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:33,660
one you teach various focus which will

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:37,590
tasting with ifsc number

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:41,790
and for having a character on some

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:46,980
devices come on give me four it's on

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:51,720
hulu this pretty that ball and any of it

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:57,090
is also driving in any more covered

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,040
roadways into identity input latency and

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,290
times it can be very helpful especially

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,990
those of your teasing each other on

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:10,320
Thursday for example if you need to

00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:14,520
cancel underbite database for 1500

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:17,820
classic setup than 10 immediately goes

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:22,140
much faster especially into the contract

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:29,220
smartcam conventional solar tried to

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:33,240
open to be bound by storage contributor1

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:43,020
we deal with flash he can easily

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:46,220
providing you realize oh no he's not

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:50,610
support this is about to destroy turbo

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,610
body was negative because a lot of

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,670
related

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,670
on occasion level it doesn't not prepare

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:03,910
labels in this case latina factor is a

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:07,660
connection with body polls have told see

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:12,880
body will typically focus three seconds

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:18,040
later and that's a lot compared to get

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,590
as much latency for a very bad and was

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,900
also a supporter of them are to be days

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:27,610
when I see net because you're asian to

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,070
say hey I'm trying to connect to

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,770
database and takes me three seconds of

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,169
an activated with red work but today we

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:40,090
don't really understand what that means

00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:42,880
network 25 and being a very poor its way

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:48,640
toward never soon can understand the

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:52,080
difference to those negative now i would

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:57,730
say in most typical my squirrel

00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:00,669
installations you buy music oh right you

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,460
don't need to every single monica

00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:06,370
depending on the load some people travel

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,520
traffic lights out set something

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:11,680
connections or connections came from

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,590
automatically the whole stress on how to

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:21,430
set up for me some savings as you want

00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:23,980
to apply and I the typical savings so

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:36,790
you don't want to miss my backbone we

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:43,900
want to myself all the time we won two

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:53,140
awards brunette create and destroy the

00:24:43,900 --> 00:25:00,250
feature a small amount of virus Parker's

00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:06,820
right human I mean these are not

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:12,610
every single said but sometimes those

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:15,910
can be very help and after all the

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:18,040
intimacy of network is especially have

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:21,310
many connections into complicated

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:25,240
installed per season next made quite

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:27,730
poor and thou mayest well especially the

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,850
thread pool project in my soul

00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:34,600
enterprise with one server or are you

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:37,290
can time to realize a location you can i

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,820
watch with a hell that creature

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:46,460
persistent me there are most wireless

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,580
setup to approach it inside

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,290
Matheny had my painter season connection

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,290
through a process and try to get

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:05,390
question of characterization now and

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:13,340
involved so how many Iran's high school

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:17,750
Rivera how many do run utilize and how

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:26,810
do you go around I should've up oh yeah

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:32,470
oh ok so what is going on here in those

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:32,470
two companies or their organization has

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,150
all right visualization very provides

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,360
all the benefits either just to remember

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,820
or not make this whole history and if

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,090
any one and all the Phoenicians hurt

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:51,080
before had a very small or pretty much

and I'll to invest on boxes well ekh

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,580
opposite right yeah the debasement

00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:59,090
especially if you are considered to be

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,270
great from a very better to utilise mon

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,720
Dieu benchmark for some time actually

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:07,850
will discuss

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:13,510
those take five percent overhead and

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:22,810
they created it's actually 55 surprised

00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:25,790
you don't want to because this is

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:29,000
patrick on time right so as I was saying

suppose that would be a stylist I mean

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:10,880
which Dina typical rasa or mass systems

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:14,270
for different reasons revving looking

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,900
for a genetic capacity change and I

00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:20,330
first order to be able to do the skill

to move to interpret right big animals

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:45,300
help us make bookings astoria education

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:48,480
or absence teachers use those things for

00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:54,910
teachers and weaknesses make sure you

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:58,210
you understand why you are searching my

00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,880
captain awesome BDSM and someone gives

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,360
it up being moved from citizen X the

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,700
sign for their performance and these

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:11,750
don't work about all

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:15,830
move designed for ultra especially for

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:19,940
later seibert LOL is compared to some

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:25,279
partisan Society of me not issue as many

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:28,490
concurrent requests I and it all the

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,309
things like Santa's head elf power

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:36,260
behind them they are able to stop the

00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:47,649
older concurrent first by the ladies man

00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:51,950
that'll happen oh let's go to it yes I

00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:57,309
want to eat with workloads smooth after

00:30:51,950 --> 00:31:02,000
his head give my eyes a surprising hook

00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:06,799
it's not like you he must go into all

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:14,260
that not only attempt ascended to the

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,260
posted limit result in the sixties works

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,870
see

00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:40,760
so generation what we hear what one is a

00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:44,059
danger I'm a security warranty for and

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:48,140
in the weather things I would say go

00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:52,399
back for two reasons reasonable one the

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:55,309
mice well is typically they're over the

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,250
phone in hand on your boss anything

00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:59,990
right so it is easier to just be ample

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:05,720
protection between different and

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:08,690
possible it may not be there is much to

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:13,659
attend access approach to is it only

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,659
viable team or database box or any

00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:55,370
so he actually comes with an order for

00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:59,870
some work clothes like msn or salad see

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:05,600
a fighting heart but less identity it's

00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:09,230
a little more likely also help pieces

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:14,690
i've seen the enemy dinners have a

00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:17,840
medium fun and experience societies and

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:23,440
my school cats are we change something

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:28,580
trying to restart their composure

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:33,290
contains the now heartbreak and activity

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:35,830
light blue might as well is to eat any

00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:39,770
new senators are they think they're

00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:42,950
there when you're on my show 0 you want

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:51,260
the size Ibaka for property so we never

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:52,850
have to talk right here is no reason if

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,060
you would see my shoulder with

00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:09,970
my driver and the bar being smaller to

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:14,320
act in that way life is changing is the

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:17,780
party propaganda greater otherwise

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,520
maestra villains will sort of resort

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:26,110
certain amount of space to a sport for

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,110
 driver which can reduce

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:34,359
my score top out of cash hope your files

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,990
your job in the system when it's the

00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:43,720
letter this is how to say you want to

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:49,119
set that Center in average finally as we

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:54,940
started his wires Numa assets much work

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:57,849
but chances are you'll have most more

00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:01,150
service unless it's the same with it for

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:04,809
heaven's issued a new assignment siyah

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:11,730
difference many guys have about two

00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:15,210
different continues and that means

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:20,460
they're get attached to allocate memory

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:20,460
appropriate to make it faster

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:30,520
same to you that isn't very well advised

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,280
to publicize predators and sometimes

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:39,580
that can be allocated so is it also won

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:46,270
a single area both sides equal very

00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:57,609
sadly I want to go to a complicated

00:35:46,270 --> 00:36:08,710
background into union with and either

00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:12,119
one server axis outer of my Qaddafi so

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:17,619
let's talk about the storage now

00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:20,230
mantegna much like the loser is to

00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:23,710
separate our agencies in my storage

00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:26,790

00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:44,670
features and unless you are to create

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:44,670
after like that it is pretty much three

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:55,569

fashion happening our little slow so far

00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:41,529
but i would still see you develop my

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:46,270
school by automated next three to six

00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:50,410
months I needed probably warranties I

00:43:46,270 --> 00:44:00,490
was lost but will be good workout and a

00:43:50,410 --> 00:44:08,260
genie Michael positive 3 hood gender how

is an utter of georgia game manages

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:57,280
easier to produce ever seen the national

00:44:51,820 --> 00:45:05,810
systems which may have originally

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:08,450
compiled invest 50 for the test from God

00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:10,550
wash ourselves if you want to tell you

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:13,640
endorphins it's much needed to download

00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:19,190
budget targets set of our shows an

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:22,160
option you can test our behavior and

00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:24,560
only there for Snowden will be offered I

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,460
will take unless you are doing something

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:35,119
in changes to Marsh well like Facebook

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:40,910
or Twitter I suggest you not do now is

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:45,830
the into actual i mean 'rebel venice

00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:51,160
looking for a invest like literally much

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:55,480
for assistance right millions test test

00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:57,790
bill major be graded and we have seen

00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,010
all those that means that some sort of

00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,530
libraries don't really work well in

00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:05,440
micro scratches or something on fire

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:10,680
girls and the unsaved right so for

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:18,460
safety reason i would suggest avoid that

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:21,700
well unless you have arrows the signal I

00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,420
believe that we will compile eyes will

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,240
be divided

00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:36,060
enjoy the whole ten percent of it

00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:39,060
eventually my superiors now my 2056

00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:51,600
improve before my school of the holes

00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:56,820
are not good enough for major options

00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:08,460
roger was a fireman had definitely never

00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:15,180
gave it almost all the way two great

00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:21,270
dishes here provide maestro of my heart

00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:28,740
configuration that's please stop

00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:35,010
violence but just you in more losses did

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:38,760
you order always check in any one that

00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:42,860
is your natural method more significant

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,860
impact on performance on I

00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:59,180
it is a plus mad and put your most

00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:00,860
heinous you don't want things to be that

00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,710
would have both in monstrovia

00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:08,870
decorations I get there sunsets and

00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:12,320
rather the integral part sucks this is

00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:20,180
very very word for our edification the

00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:23,420
large size except six more they're very

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:27,590
wise women tackle try to write the word

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:31,280
but they're longer the every time you

00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:34,160
get right so that's how you have to

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,560
consider in terms of price very happy

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:41,580
time is Tanith proportion

00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:54,450
oh so you may want to test that to make

00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:58,520
sure your mobloc and i have a question

00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:02,610
mark here because there is no exactly

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:06,480
decision half a decision about what can

00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:09,570
a consistency guarantees you or me tab

00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,510
if you want today to fully the rules

00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:16,110
over the commute today is there your

00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:22,530
season on the disney one set one if you

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:25,200
don't if you are saying it's ok my

00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:28,950
twitter process Louisa late for us APPL

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:38,850
seconds then new technological appears

00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:43,620
to these are two most here are some more

00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:47,160
about sometimes you have so much power

00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:52,020
system we have to use on a single my

00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:54,960
story in this case then you are not for

00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:59,100
instance my so sometimes you can get

00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:04,410
their phones by buying episode cpu city

00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:12,110
watch so we don't you jump back for

00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:20,790
right that's in an hour opportunity

00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:23,370
sometimes you may develop work sometimes

00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:38,190
it can potentially through here free

00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:41,640
come on my turn again oh I missed Elliot

00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:46,140
I think an elegance I'd advise you can

00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:48,620
be used very well made great debate was

00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,930
not supported we talked

00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,720
create a snapshot before you do

00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:58,820
maintenance because he thinks goes

00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:04,550
alright mice well start out and eat her

00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:08,690
happy to be here nacho with melvin air

00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:12,080
the university can actually promote any

00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:15,980
more parties measure restore database

00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:23,470
into original state very much possible

00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:28,420
oracle database back can they now that

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:32,570
is his mileage can be here that sweet

00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:35,810
i'll go to skip to hear which can be

00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:40,580
solutions which are not always practical

00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:52,540
but they all hear them because no one's

00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:58,040
great hey organized picture so my time

00:51:52,540 --> 00:52:02,060
how's our star competes becomes family

00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:04,970
cigna especially for sure that you very

00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:10,850
wise but everyone's focused it may eat

00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:14,590
my ice world in our set each other 100s

00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,590
be muscle stopped because I

00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:24,099
my database would be able to track down

00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:26,859
all the new stuff we don't want that yes

00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:29,140
narrator goes right out in this case I

00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:32,920
will lose my school shut down instead of

00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:39,579
you get shattered hopes kill trees will

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:43,359
wait for and I think I'm saying is sad

00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:49,440
sleep soundly after they are great for

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:52,359
you daily which can be very much

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,730
inappropriate for being treated why were

00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:56,730
you need to check energy tables over

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,240
time and that my finger we have some

00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:08,730
very indiscreet trying data or you can

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:16,630
charm us well that is not really started

00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:20,660
12 to be good reason upgrade and I ever

00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:26,059
see people of envision bar is this

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:29,859
daj post post perfect sometimes I use

00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:34,160
inside high school or grade maxwell

00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:38,839
something get on and get there by four

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:41,750
but it won't be able to upgrade it might

00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:46,309
never see the day that these packages

00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:48,799
left the country here take chances are

00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:51,920
you able to start a show successfully

00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:55,700
just wrong up to five but later on

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:59,480
somebody will want to install packages

00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:02,359
and what you have is detachable discard

00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,039
all there is my sources to deserve equal

00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:10,430
opportunity let me continue at right now

00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:15,680
let me shut it out right and then with

00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:19,369
an athlete pretty on the inside sound

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:22,880
small speaker progress progress and he

00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:26,900
getting all my scooter went out the

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,450
without me having worked a lot of you

00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:40,180
get beaten by a certain and more robust

00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:43,180
this I know we have a fish so any

00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,180
heavier

00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:57,109
so that is that it goes my approach teal

00:54:53,300 --> 00:55:00,470
and happines alter air crawl a little

00:54:57,109 --> 00:55:03,619
visit so you up to me installation

00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:05,319
upgrades of the manger deploy high

00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:08,270
school appropriate configuration

00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:14,359
especially on a large scale there are

00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:18,589
number on similar that goes into the

00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:21,530
compound you can use they all have been

00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:27,109
various and I don't care what you use it

00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:30,319
as well to use and Immigration

00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:32,630
Department well as Marshall

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:35,390
configuration washing and under version

00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:42,520
control you open though what has changed

00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:46,150
more than possible are monitoring chain

00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:52,280
network is very important for

00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:56,349
successfully used ago ready to try to

00:55:52,280 --> 00:56:02,660
too strong to just make sure of your

00:55:56,349 --> 00:56:07,460
name is Patrick our portal to be used

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:15,170
the device will the 1.05 eat each

00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:16,970
provider you can see papa I supplying

00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:28,780
more advice here and we'll supply the

00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:34,370
Moscow and the price point right so

00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:38,570
pretty fancy and also on my mind a lot

00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:42,320
to do and advanced MRSA which is to

00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:47,330
graph it is a very good tool you need to

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:59,030
do some advanced simulation stuff anyway

00:56:47,330 --> 00:57:06,430
Oh what I got a grandma barking what was

00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:09,770
that means English chronically shocked

00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:13,610
so you can you stop rather than me nerdy

00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:16,100
stuff we want to be killed so you want

00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:18,410
to find priorities and you can configure

00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:24,080
work

00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:26,640
one of these in my program is changed

00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:34,140
circuit because I want to be able to

00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:41,340
login to go to read that my my sister to

00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:46,050
prom mistake ah if possible Oh carrier

00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:48,930
it takes time I feel bad as any gone I

00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:52,890
mean you'd rather than some facts draws

00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:56,160
back out to be unkind process we start

00:57:52,890 --> 00:58:00,060
to drag me off into the very handy to

00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:04,290
curate and um adjusting the proper you

00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:09,120
can use this minus 17 for the progress

00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:12,660
to the two- the prototype or you can

00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:18,000
continue some process to be killed more

00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:30,750
left it to reach a visual it took two

00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:35,310
minutes to what makes you go to recruit

00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:39,470
google monuments means ha i saw talk

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:44,640
very very hot

00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:51,150
my aspects in something weird is going

00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:55,830
on a space is your very good friend like

00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:58,380
permission errors Oh profile in case of

00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:01,860
your tonight especially seeking about

00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:07,580
that's great too to understand what is

00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:10,910
happening there right westview

00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:16,710
especially at icici used to systemadmin

00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:20,040
began to bother remarkable gdp he openly

00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:23,390
microtubules a pistol or call a woman

00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:26,730
profile to see the nice toast stalls

00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:30,890
where exactly the source for those who

00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:39,090
can make google ad revenues oh my god

00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:45,380
poor poor and the model give also helps

00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:45,380
to automate both GV workers

00:59:49,070 --> 01:00:06,930
employee different moves out there well

00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:12,810
where again makes about my school videos

01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:18,380
as well you can't ever be interested in

01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:18,380
our each other we prove both slides and

01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:31,220
conferences on life adjusted the place

01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:35,820
authorities and all great slide

01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:41,400
auctioneering powers he killed important

01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:48,920
future then oh we have here the Michael

01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:48,920
Knight is happening to get ready yes

01:00:51,380 --> 01:01:03,450
being legalized a girl in place monkey

01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:06,410
and that's that's it with only one

01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,410
that's atmosphere

01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:26,130
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:28,290
way to better utilize all your resources

01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:31,770
and it makes managing all your resources

01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:35,599
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:39,089
happening in open source the

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,920
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:43,020
of the community and the speed at which

01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,000
these are these you know these these

01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:47,310
deficiencies these bugs are getting

01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,920
discovered and then fixed is the thing

01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:52,560
that really shows the power of the you

01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,240
know of the open source community it is

01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:58,470
global and it's definitely because of

01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:04,800
the users community people are extremely

01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:06,540
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,190
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,109
these guys helping each other out and

01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:12,990
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:02:10,109 --> 01:02:14,820
manner the product is transparent for

01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:18,839
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:21,060
base everyone can see how close that is

01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:26,940
being built nothing nothing is

01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:29,580
proprietary everything is open in many

01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:33,780
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:37,530
unborn health I'll stack the most

01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:41,280
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:44,100
was our first developer boot camp

01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,740
and our call gave people I gave you two

01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:50,610
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:54,870
expecting 25 or 30 people so if we ended

01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:57,720
up with 87 people and had to go get more

01:02:54,870 --> 01:03:00,240
chairs in the room twice everything

01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,480
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,570
is open source and so I don't think that

01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,310
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:11,340
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:13,890
computing and so i think it's i think

01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:15,420
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:19,130
about cloud computing you're really

01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:19,130
talking about a source cloud computing

01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:25,470
cloud zac is a robust solution for large

01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:27,870
deployments you have dozens of data

01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:31,890
centers and thousands of servers in each

01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:35,160
data centers these hardware is going to

01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:38,370
fail and CloudStack is designed to

01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,830
handle number one that mass scale number

01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:43,560
two it's designed to handle the failure

01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:45,840
that inevitably happens in large

01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:49,090
deployments we started working on

01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,820
college attack over four years ago

01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:54,760
you know it was the original set of

01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:56,950
people working on it had a background of

01:03:54,760 --> 01:04:00,760
delivering software telcos and service

01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:05,170
providers lots of QA lots of users

01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:08,290
actually using it high availability is

01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:11,860
the key feature multiple hypervisors

01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:14,290
support different network models you can

01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,330
pick up whatever suits you better while

01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:20,230
step management server can be deployed

01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:22,030
in different physical machines it

01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,680
definitely has a huge footprint it's

01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:29,080
being deployed everywhere there's a

01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:30,810
major movie studio that they were using

01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:34,030
CloudStack they were using it to

01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:36,190
transcode video and I thought that was

01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,510
terribly fascinating what I found more

01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,780
fascinating is what they did during

01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:43,570
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:44,950
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,690
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:50,470
the instances and go back to doing a

01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,910
little work cloudstack is vast it

01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,440
touches so many different aspects and

01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:55,660
there's no one person that's kind of

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,140
like a master of all those realms I

01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:01,810
think CloudStack as a project is going

01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:05,580
to be one of the leaders simply because

01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:12,250
it's some of the most feature fallen and

01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:15,510
and robust platforms out they were Adam

01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:15,510
senior limit for the clouds dag

01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:33,420
most enterprises today realize that

01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:35,099
usernames and passwords alone aren't

01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,470
enough to keep their networks saved from

01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,539
unauthorized intrusions that's my

01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:41,579
two-factor authentication has gotten so

01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,680
popular lately that adds that extra

01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:46,349
layer of protection enterprise networks

01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,119
need to stay safe but what you may not

01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:50,339
know is that some two-factor

01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:52,529
authentication solutions they're better

01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:55,589
than others like two-factor strong

01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:57,869
authentication with wicked wicked goes

01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:59,819
beyond other authentication systems by

01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:02,880
being less expensive easier to implement

01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:05,339
and easier to use giving software-based

01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,220
token clients built to run on all major

01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:10,819
devices and OSS including iOS and

01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:13,109
Android these tokens utilize a

01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:15,539
public/private key combination that's

01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:17,489
generated on device so there aren't any

01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:20,009
shared secrets flying around or

01:06:17,489 --> 01:06:22,890
attackers to hijack or which require any

01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:24,749
special handling instead all keys are

01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:27,210
kept secure and private between the

01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:29,400
requesting token and your server which

01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:31,039
you control aim house making it the most

01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,690
secure way possible to perform

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,539
authentication encryption and with an

01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:39,269
extensive flexible API that support for

01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:41,249
protocols like ldap and radius wicket

01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:42,630
works with any enterprise network

two-factor authentication for the first

01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:56,579
time we're just ready to ditch your

01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:58,950
existing expensive key file system we

01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:03,890
can help with easy to implement easy to

01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:03,890
use strong authentication from wicked

01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:12,630
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,849
ago we could not have imagined that

01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:17,070
asterisk would not only become the most

01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:19,200
widely adopted open source communication

01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,240
software on the planet but that it would

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,760
impact the entire industry in the way

01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,740
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,380
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,330
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,430
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:33,839
transition of power from the hands of

01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:36,089
the traditional proprietary phone

01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:38,490
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:40,440
administrators of phone systems using

01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,670
this power our customers have created

01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,619
all sorts of business changing

01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,450
applications from small office phone

01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:47,970
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:49,589
the international carrier networks in

01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:51,359
fact there's even an entire country

01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:53,760
those communications infrastructure runs

01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,890
on esters the gym has always been about

01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,599
creating technology that expands

01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:59,760
communications capabilities in ways that

01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,140
we could never have imagined and that's

01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,780
part of what's game-changing about the

01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,240
gym today we're doing it again this time

01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,339
by introducing a new family of HD IP

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,619
phones that extends control of the user

01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:12,390
all the way to the desktop the launch of

01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,910
these new products represents the next

01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:16,560
phase indigenous history of innovation

01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,600
these are the first and only IP phones

01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,100
designed to fully leverage the power of

01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,719
estrus when we first discussed our

01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,520
expectations for building a family of

01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:25,680
phones for use with asterisk our

01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,420
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,040
the team to build the phones such that

01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,259
they were easy to install integrate

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,089
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:35,670
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:37,290
that goal user feedback is validating

01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:39,420
that when it comes to operation with

01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:41,819
astro space systems including our own

01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:44,400
Switchvox based product these are the

01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:45,719
easiest to use best integrated most

01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,299
interoperable products on the market

01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:50,299
today the digitally phones will

01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:52,350
initially include three IP des hommes

01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:54,299
uniquely designed to complement any

01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:56,160
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:58,830
these phones are different for a number

01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:01,469
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:02,910
designed for use with esters secondly

01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:04,520
we've made it really easy to

01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,930
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,609
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:10,319
to access information inside of

01:09:08,609 --> 01:09:12,020
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,510
between an application and the

01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,700
all additionally we've created an

01:09:14,510 --> 01:09:18,799
applications engine that allows users

01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:21,410
and developers to create and run their

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:23,480
own apps on the following and finally

01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:25,549
we've done all of this at a very

01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,200
compelling price point at Digium we're

01:09:25,549 --> 01:09:29,000
always thinking of ways to give our

01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,370
customers the best value in business

01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,230
phone systems and also give them the

01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:35,390
power to create their own solutions or

01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:37,190
any communications challenge will

01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:38,990
continue to push the boundaries not only

01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,029
to make Astra's cooler bastard more

01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:42,770
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:45,290
asterisk and communications even easier

01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:48,490
and together we'll change the way the

01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:48,490
world communication again

01:09:56,130 --> 01:10:00,400
your customers rely on your website or

01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:02,770
application if it's slower

01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:05,710
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:07,540
and costs you money keeping your

01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:11,030
business critical systems humming along

01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:13,880
requires insight into what they're doing

01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:15,860
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,349
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,420
resource limitations and other problems

01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:22,190
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,800
your systems performance metrics in

01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:27,650
real-time and record this data for later

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,630
analysis enter longview the new way to

01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:31,670
see what's really going on under the

01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:33,800
hood the longview dashboard lets you

01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:35,780
visualize the status of all your systems

01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,510
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:41,630
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:44,090
memory swap processes load and network

01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:46,670
usage click a specific system to access

01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:48,679
its individual dashboard then click and

01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:51,679
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:53,659
more detail comprehensive network data

01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,360
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:57,949
is available on the network tab and disk

01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,840
rights and free space on the disk

01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:02,690
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,239
displays usage statistics for individual

01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:07,400
processes the system info tab shows

01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:09,650
listening services active connections

01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,780
and available updates adding long view

01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:13,460
to a system is easy just click the

01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:15,619
button copy the one line installation

01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:18,050
command then run the command on your

01:11:15,619 --> 01:11:19,760
linux system to complete the process the

01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,949
agent will begin collecting data and

01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,770
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:26,350
start rolling

01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:28,720
used longview to gain visibility into

01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:32,460
your servers so when your website or app

01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,460
heats up it stays up

01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:12,719
