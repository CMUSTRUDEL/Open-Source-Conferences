the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,929
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,429

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,119
fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,269
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,439
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,649
make these videos possible but that you

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,670
chose Drupal because of the

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,190
functionality gives you and the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,300
separation of roles that it gives you

00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,850
these are the typical roles you'll see

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,320
in a web development shop you'll have an

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,090
architect who does the pulling of the

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,200
levers the general outline of the site

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,320
the vision for the site as it will the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,879
architect in a drupal shop has a few

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,800
more responsibility since a lot more of

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,930
the site is in their controller can be

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,910
in their control there's a developer who

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,859
extends the functionality of core Drupal

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,390
there's a theme or who changes the way

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,250
it looks the idea behind modules such as

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,689
views and panels is that we can further

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,150
separate and abstract out these

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,430
responsibilities views allows you as an

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,049
architect to build displays of the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,750
content in your site without consulting

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,640
a developer panels allows you not only

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,860
to do the same and change where up

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:30,630
content appears but it has a layout

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:32,640
editor built in so first views if you

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,590
have a typical site you have a lot of

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,570
content on it you might have a you know

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,420
30 40 pages or you might have a hundred

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,610
articles a couple hundred blog posts and

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,240
if you've defined some content types for

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,530
something a little more esoteric say

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,590
Spacely sprockets you've got sprockets

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,049
of various dimensions and cog number you

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,820
need a way to pull that content out and

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,219
display it in a way that's logical and

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,670
coherent to the user what you might see

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,610
on recite are you know tables or lists

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,380
or grids what views does is it gives you

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,259
the ability to generate those those

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,150
views grids and lists by clicking

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,560
through a stepwise process panels is a

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,290
little harder to explain

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,819
panels is a bit like a hotel concierge

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:23,730
in one respect what panels does is when

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:26,099
someone makes a request for a page panel

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,959
says well okay who are you and why are

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,940
you here and what kind of permissions do

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,220
you have and based on the information

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,290
that panels gets it can customize the

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,489
page that it delivers it can show or

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,519
hide blocks it can put view pains in

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,250
different areas or it can feed say the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,500
user ID to a view so that it the content

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,880
is tailored to them specifically now

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,340
these are things you can do with blocks

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,250
but panels is a far more flexible way of

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,930
doing it and it's less reliant on PHP

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,000
there are a lot of things that you would

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,709
be doing with the block system where

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,530
you'd be writing custom PHP to feed

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,540
information to your view panels there's

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:09,569
point and click and you'll never fail

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:11,640
your PHP it won't break so let's create

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,260
a theoretical content type I'm assuming

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,560
you guys know what content types are

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,090
show of hands yeah okay we're going to

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,989
create a theoretical content type I

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,579
think there was a slide we were going to

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,760
go to but I'll come back to it has a

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:28,500
title a body and three fields so we have

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,569
a couple hundred of these on the site we

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,670
want to display them so we're going to

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,170
create a view the view doesn't

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,730
necessarily want to show all of that

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,650
content field one and two is only

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,510
relevant in a certain context so we're

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,480
going to show only the title body and

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,579
filled three all right we also only want

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,680
to show content of the content type of

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:48,420
interest which is to say our sprockets

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,010
we only want to show the name of the

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,299
sprocket a short description which we're

00:03:50,010 --> 00:04:00,150
calling body and say the number of the

00:03:53,299 --> 00:04:01,560
sprockets on the COG then panels allows

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,170
us to take that view that we've

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,620
generated that display and place it

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,120
within a region not only does allow you

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,980
to place it within a specific region it

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,440
allows you to specify whether or not

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,910
that content shows based on a context

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,799
supplied to it so it really with me so

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,579
far it's alright if it doesn't make

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,460
sense we're going to be going through

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:27,240
this three or four times so here's an

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,940
example scenario this is a site we did

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,349
this guy does dxf files they're

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,120
basically vector files for cnc machines

00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:38,220
he wanted product kits he wanted to

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,289
display his latest product kits on a

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,490
view on the side of the site so here you

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:45,979
can see a list of three products this

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,090
must have been a staging version and

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:52,139
normally they'd be different and it

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,060
would show the latest three the title a

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,970
short description of what contained in

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,729
on the price and an add to cart button

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,370
so this is actually a view pane how

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:07,940
would we go about creating that well

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:11,340
first we create our content type oops

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,960
we're going to go ahead and create our

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,550
this is a content type or calling

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,860
product kit it's actually a product kit

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,389
created by uber cars product kit module

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,610
we're just adding a couple of fields to

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,669
it one of the things you'll notice is

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,590
that I named my field the description is

00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,030
small description but the name of the

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,909
machine name for the field is field

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,110
product kit small description the reason

00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,639
you want to include the name of the

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,320
content type in the field name will

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,169
become very apparent later I'm just

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,729
calling it out so you'll recall so we

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,199
want a title we want a small description

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:48,120
and we want the cover image that's going

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,580
to appear on this product now we're

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,020
going to create a view this is going to

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,630
be under that site build menu and then

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,370
under views add view you're going to

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,949
create a machine name for the view this

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,199
is something that uniquely names the

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,210
view with in Drupal the utility of this

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,380
is that if you ever export the view you

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,630
want to make sure that there are no name

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,020
collisions this is the unique identifier

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,940
for that view the that is to say if you

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,310
create another module that creates a

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,599
latest products view you probably don't

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,560
want to name it latest underscore

00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,669
products the view description this is

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,960
what's going to appear in the list of

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,360
view so it makes it easier for you to

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,560
pick it out of that list view tag is

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,050
just a grouping thing do you type in

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,130
general you can ignore this ninety-nine

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,080
percent of the time you're going to be

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,789
using node if you guys have any database

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,229
experience what this is asking you is

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,600
what base table are you going to be

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:45,160
using

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:49,510
for the the view so it's saying are you

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,490
selecting from the users table or are

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,440
you selecting from the files table from

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,690
a comment stable well in our case we're

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,140
looking at product kits which are nodes

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:04,720
content types the product kick content

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:07,630
type with me so far all right so the way

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,250
that we look at a view is that we tend

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:14,470
to start at the right hand side if by

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,510
default views would spit out everything

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,520
in the system we don't want that we want

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,980
to filter it we want to limit it only to

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,170
the product the nodes of interest so we

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,760
create a filter when you're rather than

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,430
views you click that little bus button

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,560
and you choose whatever if you want to

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,600
filter by in our case first and foremost

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,680
we want to filter by product kit we want

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,720
to make sure that we're only seeing

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,250
product kits here if we were to stop

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,200
there drupal would complain it says

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,460
you're not showing the fields you've got

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,440
a lot of content coming through but

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,020
we're not showing anything so your next

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,560
step you move from right to left you end

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,440
up in the field section when you click

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,630
the plus section here to add fields to

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,140
display in your view you're going to

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,180
have a long list of items I'll explain a

00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,950
little bit about how to help you pull

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,170
what's relevant out of that long list

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,970
but for now let's focus on the fact that

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,470
this fields block contains the

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,960
information that's actually going to

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,700
appear in your view so in our case we

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,480
were interested in having a cover image

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,100
we want the title to appear we want a I

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,170
actually have no idea what that is I

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,910
think that's a short description sell

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,460
price and this is the Add to Cart form

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,470
so you guys recall from earlier we saw

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,360
what it was producing this is the fields

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:31,240
that we're in there and you'll recall

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,090
that we named the field product kit now

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,610
you know which content type well let me

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:38,380
back up a little bit that drop down when

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,210
you add a field it looks like this and

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,440
they're going to be you see the scroll

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,360
bar they're going to be hundreds of

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,010
items in that list finding out which

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,660
ones belong to your content type of

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,390
interest can be a little bit confusing

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,130
so the way that you assist yourself and

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,050
making sure that you get the fields that

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,360
you want is to name your content

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,630
in the machine name for that field does

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,010
that make sense all right another

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,980
convention to follow that's terribly

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,410
useful is that you name them from least

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,940
specific to most specific so if it were

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:13,060
for example cog lengths you would say

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,010
cog dimension length that way when you

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,610
sort them the dimensions we're close to

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,740
each other make sense that allows you to

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,420
more easily select things so what we

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,459
would do is when we were choosing fields

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,339
is to click the checkbox next to all the

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:29,829
ones we were interested in adding last

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:33,310
we go to this leftmost column these are

00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:37,089
things that allow you to tweak the the

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,459
way the view looks now all we've talked

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,230
about so far is what the view is doing

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,540
we haven't talked yet about how the view

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,160
looks this is where this comes into play

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,680
there are two things that you have to

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,240
focus on one is the display and the

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,290
other are the road style and well this

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,720
style is well I'll talk a little bit

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,279
about displays in a second but the row

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,660
style gives you the option to display

00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,459
something as a list so it'll be a tag a

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,000
table or it'll actually put your

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,829
elements in a table or unformatted it'll

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,020
just dump the fields directly as HTML

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,950
which one you choose is dependent upon

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,510
what your themer asks you to do they can

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,110
also do theme overrides for each of

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,600
these individual view elements so in

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,029
speaking about how we can separate the

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,829
realms of responsibility if you create

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,360
this view for your themer they can come

00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,670
back later and then click this theme

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,529
information button and it'll tell them

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,540
the names of the TPL files they need to

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,040
create to override the display of any of

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,020
the information on here so they can

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
override the display of the Li tags they

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,310
can override the display of individual

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,149
fields etc they you can add a CSS class

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,800
to the whole view and you can add a

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,250
pager to the bottom of it if there's

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,990
more than X number of items so a couple

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,779
of things I didn't go over yet sort

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,570
criteria arguments relationships we'll

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:03,430
talk about that later if we have time

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,370
for now I'm just going to focus on

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,620
that's how you approach the view system

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,230
so the last item on this page is the

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,080
display the view can be displayed as a

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,300
page where it creates an actual page

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,890
containing your view content a block

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,620
where it creates a block that you can

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:23,080
place from the blocks page a views

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,990
content pane which is used within panels

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,600
or there's a couple of others like feed

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,089
and I can't recall the others that you

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,910
they're very special use special case

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:36,220
use so if you choose to display it as a

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,339
page it'll ask you for a URL and so if

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,480
you type in a URL for it to appear at

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,270
from that point forward you go to that

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,160
URL your contents there your dog is done

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,870
what normally used to take you several

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,370
hours of back-and-forth with the

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,990
developer about what you needed and how

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,500
to frame it can now be done by you

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,450
without leaving your chair displaying it

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,279
as a block that gives you the

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,700
flexibility to display it anywhere on

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,200
the site use the block display

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,950
conditionals or you can use blocks

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,750
within panels content pains these are

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,550
exclusively for use with panels and they

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,990
give you the ability to provide context

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:19,360
to the view so that was our view and

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:27,160
your call this is what it generates all

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:35,230
right because I'll excuse me a second

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:37,120
while I had prepared some documentation

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,010
and a lot of people are asking about

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
drush earlier so i'm going to use drush

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,480
to create the d6 demo site

00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,540
oh that's right you can't do that

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,899
oops

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,899
slow

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:33,610
alright so let me so we also asked

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,020
earlier about the fact that files are

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,550
owned by a different user in this case

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,020
they're actually won by Apache which is

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,910
where web user I'm logged in as myself

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,339
so if you wanted to delete these file

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,440
you have to log in it you have to run to

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,440
do as dub-dub-dub data

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,120
alright so that's effectively deleted

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,120
that

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,630
George I've got alias to automatically

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,920
do the pseudo deshi oh so there's an

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,780
example of address command i just

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,150
downloaded the drupal site you saw i

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,530
deleted the dub dub dub folder it would

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,460
just download a drupal into a folder

00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:31,110
called drupal 6 22 and there's our

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:35,490
default install i'm going to go to make

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,620
it dub dub dub yeah it's pretty

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,710
straightforward so here's our next

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:50,790
command this whoops I keep forgetting

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:54,420
you can't copy this next command does a

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,950
site install with the admin name seeing

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,110
set the admin password being set the

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,120
password sets the email address that's

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,900
the site name is Drupal 6 demo site and

00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,880
then it sets the Drupal password for the

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,020
earthen sorry the my sequel password and

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,470
my sequel connection string so make sure

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:16,820
everything is fine there and it fall

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,820
fails miserably oh

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:31,530
do to do to do there that's done now if

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:36,720
we were to go to d6 demo we should have

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:42,990
a site up there tada so you've got a

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:45,390
Drupal Saltonstall created already it

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:50,850
did or this one did the site install did

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:52,950
the database install Oh evening well no

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,310
within my sequel my server set up in a

00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,960
way that I create databases on the fly I

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:04,560
there's a lot of little things that the

00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:06,900
staging server setup to be is my I men

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,850
and greatest yeah you can dude rush

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,130
sequel and and if you provide a

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,500
connection string you can actually log

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,360
into sequel from there or my sequel

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,720
admin and just create the table right by

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,790
the command line now let me tweak

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,730
something really quick on my server i

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:26,400
use a virtual documentary so if i don't

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:31,350
specify this I get forbidden errors or

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:36,270
500 errors all right next up we want to

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,670
have a couple of modules installed I did

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:43,110
it again so we're going to go ahead and

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,780
run Josh and say install these we're

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,030
installing image API CTools views cck

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,580
backup my gray image field file field

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,870
path auto image cache I mean these are

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,920
all modules that you normally would have

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:58,770
had to go out and download manually so

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,010
poof they're all downloaded next step I

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,010
want to enable several of those modules

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,610
whoops dad come it

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:21,330
the dash Y sells it to automatically say

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:24,510
yes this fire PHP you can ignore safely

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:29,600
alright so now let's go ahead and login

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:33,440
to our site so that was password right

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,440
maybe it wasn't password

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:46,280
what was it

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:49,070
I thought it was password there it goes

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,540
ok this is admin menu I install it on

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,679
all night I don't know if you guys are

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,120
familiar with if you don't use it it's

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,250
excellent alright so we've just built

00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,230
from scratch a drupal site installed

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,270
several modules and enabled them all

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,990
from the command line about six or seven

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,220
lines we're ready to go if you had built

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,480
features that define some of the

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,710
functionality of the site you could

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,270
enable those features and you'd have an

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,610
article system in place you'd have a

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,190
blog system in place without having to

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,429
do any configuration at all so I

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:26,510
actually stopped there so I'm going to

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:37,870
create a content type I'm going to call

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:40,370
it come on I made it Angry multi-colored

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:48,380
windowpanes for reasons that will become

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:55,549
clear later add a multi-colored window

00:18:48,380 --> 00:19:01,250
pane to the site leave a title and body

00:18:55,549 --> 00:19:02,570
actually we'll call it a description and

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,580
this is one of those irritating things

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,230
about Drupal it always promotes things

00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,690
to front page so it shows up in that /

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,980
node view seem I want to disable that by

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,570
default because if somebody visits your

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,980
site and go / know they're going to see

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,340
a whole bunch of content you wouldn't

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,600
necessarily want to present in that way

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,429
or you can just alias it out of

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:27,530
existence also comments are enabled by

00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:29,380
default all right so there's our content

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:33,559
type let's add a couple of fields to it

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:37,030
and while we're at it before I get there

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,030
I'm going to add an image cache preset

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:51,130
and one of the things i do as a best

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:52,890
practice by for image cache presets as I

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,200
name the dimensions in the name of the

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,730
item that way if I I'm trying to find a

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:04,809
particular one I can tell by the glance

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:11,590
which ones what now you know why i chose

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:17,520
100 by 100 i'm lazy alright so let's go

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:20,520
ahead and add a field called windowpane

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
image

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:38,289
not going to worry too much about

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:38,289
details with

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,050
it's a little thing you can do both at

00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,050
once

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,360
everybody can think of any other options

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,780
that we might add to this go and add

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,780
those now too

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,810
so I'll just add a quick drop down

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,010
classification

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,070
to do too

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,260
just give us a couple of options save

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,150
that so great now we've got a content

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,100
type and we have to go through all the

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,110
hassle of creating about 50 or 60 nodes

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,270
of it so hold on just a second I'll give

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:30,540
you about 50 of them now I'm just

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:30,540
getting we'll use rush yeah I think whoa

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,450
I forgot what other option I needed well

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,450
I don't need the kill

00:22:49,510 --> 00:23:02,470
and do I need doop doop do there now

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:11,740
I've just created 250 of these just to

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:14,740
show them to you lied to me the right

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:21,570
site either maybe I named content-type

00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:21,570
Rommel oh I did

00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:28,600
interview too

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,350
they're so you can see we've got a whole

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,640
bunch of this content now created and

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,240
now you can see why I named multicolored

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,120
window panes because devel Denner Adel

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,730
generate these images for us for use so

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,620
that's great we have a 250 these pieces

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,940
of content now on the site problem is

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,380
we'd really like to display it in a

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,980
reasonable manner say on the front page

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:57,920
would want a little listing of the top

00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,750
50 based on when they were up added to

00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,130
the site so let's go ahead and go and

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:11,380
add a view we're going to call this a

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:11,380
window oops window pane lists our views

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:23,730
we're going to leave note as the base

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:25,080
type because it is so now who can recall

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,900
what the first step should be what

00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,790
direction we should start yep start from

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,200
the right so we actually have a lot of

00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,300
options available to us in the filter

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,580
section we can filter based on comments

00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,540
we can filter on whether or not the item

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,730
is sticky weather entities are updated

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,020
whether or not they have access to it

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,690
generally speaking you want to use node

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,040
type and published unless you don't use

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,990
published on your site you can just

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:57,630
leave it out and in our case we don't so

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:59,130
I'm going to so oh well I wish it was as

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,570
simple as saying just go down the list

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:05,760
some of the descriptions are a little

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:07,020
obtuse the the easy thing for me to say

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,840
is if you don't know what it is you

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,870
probably don't need it and if you know

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:22,140
what you know this is your documentation

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:24,420
right here yeah yeah yeah well if you

00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,870
ask yourself you know what is it I want

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,130
to filter on the good bed that it's

00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,690
going to match what your description is

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,030
because I mean for example the one we're

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,540
using I want to filter on the type of

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:40,530
mode well there it is type of node say

00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:43,050
so yeah you'll want to go down this list

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:46,020
now it is grouped like we know that the

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,309
the type is related to the node so we

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,340
can filter it there and we have much

00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:52,460
less to look at but yeah it's trial and

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,540
error generally speaking though filters

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,160
if you know what you're looking for

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,440
it'll be easy to find if you don't you

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,980
don't need to worry about it all right

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,300
so oh yeah you can select multiples in

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,940
fact I'm going to go back later and do

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,710
that all right so first we want to

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,630
filter by a node type we only want to

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,730
show nodes of type multicolored window

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,860
panes now when I hit this Drupal is

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,140
going to complain it uses fields but

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,330
they're not defined that is to say this

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,030
content type has fields but we're not

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,429
showing any so it's telling us our next

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,800
step click the add fields to this

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,900
display we're not interested in anything

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,040
in the comments section we are

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,600
interested in no part

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,360
now this is something that is confusing

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,620
about Drupal the content type you would

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,180
think that those fields would be here

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,680
under node because they're attached to

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,700
the node but they're not there they're

00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,250
under content and in addition to your

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,780
content there's going two for your

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,700
content type of interest there's going

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,370
to be fields for every piece of content

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,940
so if you had a blog content type that

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,310
defined say original author or original

00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,990
citation then that would show up in this

00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,500
list and you'd have to be careful not to

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:05,210
select that because Drupal or other

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:09,780
views isn't smart enough to not tell you

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,360
that field is available so you have to

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,000
go that step further and know that the

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,880
blog original citation isn't going to be

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,140
associated with your content type now

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,210
the reason it shows you that information

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,410
is technical and it's okay that it's

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,470
there because there are times you need

00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,390
it to be there so and I'll show you what

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,620
an example of why so let's go ahead and

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:37,250
add we only want the image and we want

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:44,550
the nupes we want the node title I

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:45,630
didn't want that node title and for a

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,040
heck of it let's just go ahead and add

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,170
the node body but we're going to limit

00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,700
it so I just clicked three different

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,070
items and now it's going to give me the

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,810
option to configure specifics on each

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,490
one of them so first was the image

00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,940
they're in alphabetical so first was the

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,290
image it's asking do I want it to be

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,030
labeled no I don't want to label to

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,750
appear about format let's go ahead and

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:09,180
use my image cache preset we'll use that

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,530
one hundred 500 I can have it linked to

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,870
the node sure why not so save that now

00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,550
it's the body text again don't want the

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,870
label or you know I'll add the label in

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,790
just so you can see it however the body

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,620
text can be something like 400

00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,130
characters we don't want to necessarily

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:33,720
display all that let's trim that down to

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:35,730
50 there's or you can have it so it

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,380
trims only a word boundaries up to 50

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,990
you can add an ellipsis at the end of

00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,970
the text you can strip all the HTML out

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,320
of it or if you click this it's supposed

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,550
to close all HTML

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,800
eggs that would normally have been left

00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:50,670
open if it clicked on the 50 character

00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:53,700
limit in my experience this this thing

00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,710
isn't as smart as it claims so I just

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,870
come up with alternative solutions

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,120
either strip the HTML or deliver the

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,320
content some other way reason being is

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,090
you don't want it to accidentally break

00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,310
on a production site because if there's

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:13,920
one errant div as you've seen the entire

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:19,350
theme can go all wonky all right all

00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:22,280
right so that's all those and there's

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,050
our first example layout now this is

00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,530
this is the standard default dump which

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:29,670
means it's unformatted we're not going

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,320
to tweak this anymore so let's go ahead

00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:37,320
and change the style let's have it

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:39,600
display as a table you can ignore these

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,000
their warnings you wouldn't normally see

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,450
these so now we've got them displaying

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,500
as a table image description title one

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,030
of the things I don't like about this is

00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,250
i like the description to come after the

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:56,880
title so let's change the order of the

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:58,530
fields and then I also want that title

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,020
to link to the node when they click on

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:05,850
it poof so we've managed to create a

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,850
usable display of this content in about

00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,990
five minutes so now we're we're down to

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,780
the point where we have to decide how we

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,370
want to where we want to put this

00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,690
display do we want to put in a block so

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,430
we can place it somewhere on the page we

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,320
wanted to be its own separate page or we

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,170
want to use it within panels well let's

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,960
start with creating a page so I left it

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,600
on page click bad display if I were to

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,330
try to save now triple complain hey

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,570
there's no path see it's being helpful

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:39,270
so we'll click on page add a path let's

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:42,590
make it so that we can see this are what

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,590
does I call these windowpane archive

00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:52,350
all right and it has the option to add

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,640
it to a menu here you have more

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,230
flexibility if you add it to the menu

00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,180
yourself rather than leaving it in the

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,280
view but if you want to you can add it

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,630
to a menu from here so you would choose

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,520
this and then choose the menu want it to

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,900
appear in the reason I don't like to do

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,040
it is that you specify a weight be a

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,630
number and you have no idea what the

00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,950
rest of the menu looks like and this is

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,210
now stored in a feature so every time

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,030
you enable the feature it's going to go

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,440
right back to where it was which that's

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:18,180
not necessarily a bad thing it just

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,440
rarely is the use case I want let's go

00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:27,510
ahead and add a pager since we have more

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:29,100
than 10 items see and let's make it so

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:32,430
that it uses Ajax so it doesn't refresh

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,140
the page now you'll notice this thing

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,340
here over to write says override I'll go

00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,380
ahead and just explain what that is

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:45,990
later let's add a block display we're

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:48,090
going to call this block list pains

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,040
block that's just what's going to appear

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:57,930
in here if we want what we want to

00:31:50,040 --> 00:32:00,530
appear in the block listings oops not

00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,530
I'm in paint

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,020
exactly that's the point I was trying to

00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:09,060
get across now you can see we started by

00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,590
setting the defaults for this view we

00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,180
filtered by the node type of content

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,710
type of interest we added the fields we

00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,620
wanted to use and now we're displaying

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,830
it two different ways we displayed as a

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:22,170
page we displayed as a block now because

00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,760
it relies on the defaults for a lot of

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,980
these parameters if I wanted to update

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,480
both the page and the block display I

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,100
can do it from this default and it

00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,680
affects both of them I don't have to go

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,100
in and modify now that said I told you

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,830
just a second ago that I was going to

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,810
maybe throw a monkey wrench in here for

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,340
the block display because it has smaller

00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:43,320
amount of space we're going to override

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,590
the defaults and we're going to limit it

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,730
to maybe 15 characters so if you're

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:52,320
looking at the block you get blessed

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:53,640
text and there you go because it blocks

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,080
on word boundary it's probably clipping

00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,540
all the way down to nothing so now if

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,350
you view the block you get that if you

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,790
view the page you get the larger text

00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:12,470
that's the that's the significance of

00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:15,030
that override and use default button now

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,130
this is just an aside a non sequitur

00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,200
really but if you ever get into the

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,370
something where you you click something

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,650
it takes you to a different page you're

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,030
like oh no I lost my view and you hit

00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,750
the back button and it's all boogered up

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:32,310
you just hit ctrl R and watch it make a

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:36,510
liar out of me and all your changes are

00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:41,190
still there please still be there yes

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:43,560
they're still there and that comes in

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,830
handy because you'll accidentally click

00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:51,320
those links several times a day just

00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:55,250
saying so we'll go ahead and save that

00:33:51,320 --> 00:34:00,530
now what do we call it the page our

00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,530
window pane archive

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,720
go to that page poof there is our view

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,060
with all of our content displayed the

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,010
way we preferred to do it if you're

00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,300
using a theme that provides it you'll

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,520
have these little links that you can

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,600
edit the view in context so when you see

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,399
of you want to add it you just click

00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:23,710
there takes you right to it I'll go one

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,110
more step let's take our block that we

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,520
created list window panes let's put in

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:33,399
the left sidebar and then it's a little

00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,169
wide so where you might create a

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,179
different image cache profile override

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,190
the image display to see how to use that

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:44,290
different one so I'm going to go and

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:47,169
pull this back out so if you've been

00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,899
following along you know I've wanted to

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,460
introduce panels next and you might ask

00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,070
yourself what's what advantage does

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,360
panels provide over the block system why

00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,730
would I want to what I want to introduce

00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,970
yet another module it has a fair fairly

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,090
large learning curve already there there

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:06,580
are a couple of limitations two blocks

00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,470
one is these are the visibility settings

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,360
you have access to if you want to do

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,530
something that isn't explicitly listed

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,370
here you're going to have to resort to

00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:19,570
PHP PHP isn't the end of the world but

00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:21,970
it's not if there's a new module that

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,800
comes out that invalidates the way that

00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,270
you access the table or you're pulling

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,940
data from a module that changes the way

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,340
it stores its data your PHP is broken if

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,620
you rely on panels to provide that same

00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:35,970
functionality it's panels responsibility

00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:40,420
not yours and I love giving other people

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:44,110
responsibilities or more specifically

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:47,260
getting rid of responsibilities the

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:49,480
other thing about blocks is that we've

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:52,180
got this window pane block we can only

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,800
place that in one region that's not that

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,050
big of a limitation you would think but

00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,270
what if we wanted it on on one page to

00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,830
appear in the right sidebar but on a

00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,290
different page to appear in the left

00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,380
sidebar using the block system you'd

00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:07,210
have to clone the display for the view

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,680
and then you'd have to create two blocks

00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,910
and you have to place them separately

00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,410
and you'd have to set the settings for

00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,850
each of them so you can see how that

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,590
quickly can become a little bit of a

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,570
maintenance thing

00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,980
what panels allows you to do is it

00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,050
allows you to place blocks wherever you

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,790
like multiple times on a single page

00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:24,030
though it's hard to imagine a good

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:27,330
reason to do that and it allows you to

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,860
feed information to the block so one of

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:34,550
the things that we might be interested

00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:42,710
in doing to do let's look at our views

00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:45,330
is adding the ability to search by title

00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:51,300
so we're going to add another node title

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:53,850
filter and so you already know how the

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,670
filters work the filters limit the

00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,350
content you get back well that's great

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,410
for me to have that ability but what if

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,370
I want to give it to the user that gives

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:08,880
reviews gives us a nice little button

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:15,720
here expose boof now hold on well I

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:17,760
should've done it differently now you've

00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,460
got this nice little box here it's a

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,290
setup for UX yeah and so now we can

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,730
search dynamically for all the content

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,860
on the basis of that filter that you

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:32,940
just provided so the nice thing about

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,190
that is that you can now give users what

00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,300
seems like enterprise-class

00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:42,110
functionality with a couple of quick

00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:45,200
clicks there is a there is an additional

00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:47,820
and I hope I'm not confusing things here

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,140
thing you can do so for example if we're

00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:59,430
looking at this page where is it exposed

00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:01,260
form and block yes okay this filter here

00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:03,720
is that that it's attached to the view

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,670
you have the ability to remove it as an

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,790
attachment to the view and create a

00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:11,360
block well maybe it's best just to show

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,360
you what it does

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,359
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:30,010
so you'll notice that the filter is no

00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:33,230
longer there but we now have a new block

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:34,700
called exposed window fame exposed forum

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,050
window pane so we're actually using the

00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:42,650
one for the page let's put it in the

00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:43,940
sidebar so now we're on the block's page

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,740
but I have the ability to search the

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,100
titles here and when i hit enter it's

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,210
going to take me to this filtered so now

00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,580
you can put that in the header the

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,720
footer the sidebar you can hide it and

00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,740
let the theme or put it wherever they

00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,270
like the other thing that's nice about

00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,880
this and again I'm going a little bit

00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:05,360
off into the advanced realm is that this

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,880
is just a form so you can generate your

00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,320
own form or you can override this form

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,780
with hook forum alter like we discussed

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,700
earlier so that instead of having a

00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,730
search title here it has a drop down

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,520
list or it pulls from context or it

00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,450
shows you something dynamic that you're

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,090
not you know you're into it more

00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:28,850
interested in seeing alright so now

00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:33,110
let's talk about panels let's see what's

00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:36,280
the best way to just show a panel i'll

00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,280
create a panel page

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:16,120
due to do selection rules contacts so

00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,680
when you're creating the panel you just

00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,970
saw that I I did jump through that I

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,810
should have probably done that let me go

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:24,460
back this is administrative title how it

00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,140
appears in the list of panels this is

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,060
the machine name which you guys are

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,220
growing accustomed to ignoring but make

00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,150
sure its unique administrative

00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,740
description X creative description is to

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,930
give you an idea it's not shown to the

00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,790
user so it's only showing for you the

00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,970
path is where this panel shows up it's

00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:46,000
effectively a page it's possible also to

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,770
create blocks using panels you can make

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,260
this site your home page so that the

00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,810
panel that they land on is or the site

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,830
page they land on is this panel the

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,380
reasons you might do this will become

00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,150
apparent pretty soon optional features

00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,020
there's no harm in enabling these you

00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,460
can enable them all if you want I don't

00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:09,160
there it's just they'll give you more

00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:10,840
criteria to select so access control you

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,240
can make it so that this page is only

00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,410
accessible if they meet certain criteria

00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,550
so for example they must have

00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,570
authenticated role we're not going to do

00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,780
that yet we're going to do it in the

00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:25,540
selection contexts the difference

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,640
between selection let me get there this

00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:31,960
tells us whether or not the person has

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,120
access to view the page we're not going

00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,830
to make it difficult for them to access

00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:47,470
the page so I'm just going to create a

00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:49,180
first variant context we're going to

00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,240
pull the context which is the logged in

00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,240
user

00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:03,710
and don't worry I'll come back and

00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:05,240
explain what all this is and here's the

00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,299
layout editor we can use one of the

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,890
default layouts or we can use the

00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:11,240
Builder so we can create our own I'll

00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:21,349
create that use the Builder just to show

00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:22,730
you how it works and most of the

00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:23,990
instructions are actually on these pages

00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,309
that I'm clicking through so don't feel

00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:35,799
intimidated that there's a lot to be

00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:35,799
clicking through all right

00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,720
well

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,550
add a region to the right

00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:57,920
fluid so now you saw how the theming

00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,480
worked on the last session you were able

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,580
to define regions within the template

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,130
files panels does it differently you

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,380
defined regions with this clicking point

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,830
editor you don't have to do this you can

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,780
use the default theme content areas but

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,230
this gives the architect the flexibility

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:17,390
to define their layoffs per the

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,780
wireframes that we're being given that

00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,940
said you know the designers don't always

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,340
like this because they define a block

00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,570
with and you make the region too small

00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,440
to handle their blocks and now they have

00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:32,900
to go back and do extra work so i'll

00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,450
save that i'm going to reuse that layout

00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,450
we're going to call it my layout

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:53,140
alright so now we're to the point where

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:58,260
we define what content goes into these

00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:00,480
regions we are interested in the the

00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,290
blocks that we created through the views

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,290
so let's go ahead and do that

00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:16,610
again don't have to change any of that

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:24,080
just for a heck of it let's go ahead add

00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:26,380
some content here let's add who's on

00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,380
behind

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,829
all right and I'm going to add a variant

00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,059
again don't worry about it i'm going to

00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:39,059
come back and explain what I've all done

00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,280
oops

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:12,390
alright so we've got now two variants

00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,480
the panel the original variant that we

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:18,270
created and the new one I just created

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,270
we want to create a view of this page

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,220
that when you're not logged in you see

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,720
text that says you need to login to the

00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,270
site in order to view this content and

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,670
we want the other one to show the

00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:33,270
content of the most recently viewed

00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:36,330
pains and that who's online block so we

00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:38,280
have for this panel page two variants

00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:46,260
we'll make this one that contains our

00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:48,800
content already require that the user be

00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,800
authenticated

00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,839
okay so because this is a different

00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,940
variant I have the ability to add

00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,310
whatever content I want here so I'm

00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,310
gonna add a custom content

00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,570
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:50,650
alright so what did I call the page

00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,650
magic

00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:02,070
and there is our logged in version of

00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:03,810
the page and here's another trick that

00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:05,190
you guys might use instead of launching

00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,870
another browser you can launch the

00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,480
incognito version of the browser and

00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:18,300
because it doesn't share cookies you can

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:26,340
login to the same side again oh that's

00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:30,680
no good why would it do that if you love

00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,680
the difference between practice and demo

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:49,310
well maybe it's confused about logged in

00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:49,310
user yep that should be fine

00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:05,690
now it's the same URL the what it does

00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,150
what panels does is it based on the

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:11,690
selection criteria it shows the panel

00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:14,470
that matches the best so I'm not sure

00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:17,240
what's maybe i said something in access

00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:19,280
but that's the reason you use panels is

00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,080
because from the same URL you'd be able

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:32,290
to provide different content based on

00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:32,290
context so oh you were smarter than me

00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:46,160
yeah alright so yeah what me all right

00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:49,100
well there you go you can see that the

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,040
panel displays content differently based

00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:55,490
on whether you're logged in or not so it

00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,260
goes much much farther than that so now

00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,640
I did go through this pretty quickly I

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,080
want to go ahead and back up now that

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:07,820
you know what it does let me show you

00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:12,170
how it's doing it this is this was a

00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:16,310
panel page i created it's called a tent

00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:18,530
occation dependent panel I set a path of

00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:21,680
/ magic so that you could access it via

00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:25,630
the URL magic you can do anything there

00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,890
and you can even use percent symbols and

00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,560
the reason you do that is that whatever

00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:33,680
is typed after magic say it was magic /

00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,870
% magic / 5 that five would be available

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,810
to you as a context that you can now use

00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:40,850
to as a selection rule so if somebody

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,500
want to select magic / 5 you could

00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,510
create a panel variant that was only

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,000
visible to them so it'd be like a hidden

00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:48,860
something more realistically what you

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,440
would use that for is an argument to a

00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,440
view so what's an argument to a view

00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:03,299
let's say that in addition to providing

00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:07,170
that filter we want them to specify via

00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:14,609
the URL a search term so let's go ahead

00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:17,309
and do that doo-doo-doo let's see is

00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:20,329
that the best way to do this never

00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,329
actually done it on title

00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,270
do

00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:47,130
yeah I'm worried that it's going to want

00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:59,280
me to provide the entire one let's just

00:50:47,130 --> 00:51:00,950
do it by one so now because I haven't

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,059
specified a letter I won't show anything

00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,760
now it will only show stuff starting

00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:09,240
with a now it will only show stuff

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,690
starting with b so instead of using a

00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,460
filter to specify how I filter the

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:16,410
content I'm using an argument to specify

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:21,720
how I filter the content does that make

00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:28,170
sense what I just did there so arguments

00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:30,109
are the same as a fill you use glossary

00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,579
mode and specify how many characters

00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:35,730
yeah this is useful for when you're

00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:37,650
creating an alpha list yeah so you what

00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:43,079
you do is you put the alpha list HTML in

00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:46,109
that and the header for the table so

00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,700
where was I you also notice that the

00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:56,160
title of the page changes depending upon

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:57,809
what you've typed here so a argument is

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,490
the same as a filter in terms of what it

00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:01,440
does to the content when it's displaying

00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,109
it the difference is where that filter

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,660
comes from filters are either explicitly

00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:07,799
provided or have a user interface

00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,289
element for you to provide the

00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:14,640
information arguments come from the URL

00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:16,829
or from context so we just added an

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,460
argument for the first letter that comes

00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:25,440
from here see it's not a good example oh

00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:29,279
my oh wow I'm on 10 minutes from and I

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:33,140
told you guys I'd finish early I'm gonna

00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:33,140
wrap up then any questions

00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:53,000
yeah before we get to the hard stuff

00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:55,160
there so let's see here this is the

00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,020
layout and it layout is variant on a per

00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,700
variant basis so one variant can look

00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,990
one way and have you know for several

00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:06,560
columns the other variant can have them

00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:09,860
on just the one all right so I've

00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,000
already set this type so I'm actually

00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:15,710
going to have to change the layout

00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:21,200
entirely so you if you want to build

00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:23,000
your own choose builders oops and it's

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,530
because I'm changing the table or the

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,940
layout and because there's already

00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,680
content there it's asking me where to

00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,760
move the existing content if you are

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:37,610
creating a panel from scratch you

00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:39,890
wouldn't have this step okay so now if

00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,780
you have leave layout flexible as an

00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:43,610
option I would still have this button

00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,680
but and as a builder you have this

00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:49,370
button you click this it gives you the

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:55,960
ability to add region to the left side

00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:55,960
it let's add another row

00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:08,039
and so you can add as many as you like

00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:13,769
you can change the Wits the heights and

00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:16,079
the entire structure of it I personally

00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:17,789
I mean I don't know that there's a whole

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,289
lot of use for this i think that the

00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:21,269
femur tends to provide you with what you

00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:22,980
need most of the time but if you need

00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:25,410
the ability to modify that you have that

00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:27,480
right there so or they'll provide you

00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,589
with a layout they prefer you to use and

00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,539
you just choose it from the list they

00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:36,210
give you yeah many panels is something I

00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:37,619
would love to talk about but to really

00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,349
get the concept across takes a little

00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:41,789
bit so you saw what panels do I mean you

00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:43,529
can provide them with context and they

00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:45,900
can change what they show based on that

00:54:43,529 --> 00:54:48,420
context many panels work exactly the

00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,220
same way you can provide them context

00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,319
they show you different information so

00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,089
why that extra level of abstraction well

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,099
there might be things like for example a

00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:58,349
sidebar that contains the user profile

00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:00,150
picture at the last time they logged in

00:54:58,349 --> 00:55:01,319
and who else is logged in and those are

00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,999
three blocks you don't want to have to

00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:05,039
add to every panel variant that you do

00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:06,390
so you create a mini panel and include

00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,880
that on every panel that you create

00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:10,230
those mini panels are also available as

00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,420
blocks so you can use it with the

00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:17,700
traditional block system see so now the

00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,589
last thing about blocks versus panels

00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:23,339
and the big raging war and debate is

00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:25,769
that features does not store blocks at

00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:29,579
least not without a helper module that

00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:32,130
only barely does the job so if you want

00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:35,309
to package up layouts you can't do it

00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:38,009
with blocks you'd have to write a module

00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:41,069
that handles the block placements panels

00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:43,170
are exportable through features are they

00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:45,359
yeah through features so you can export

00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,799
an entire panel with its layout with all

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,509
of the contents and all the views

00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,880
associated with it all as a single

00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:52,230
feature and the utility that comes from

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,289
the fact that say that you've got a

00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:58,440
panel that defines again say a blog it

00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:02,339
has a blog header blog archive a last

00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,839
five posts and submit a new post and

00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,609
that's all part of a single panel that

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,319
you've created that is now a single

00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:09,119
exportable that you create as a feature

00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:11,220
and you can roll that out to his many

00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,920
sites as you like and then down the line

00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,450
if you've discover that you made a

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,890
mistake in that the are

00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:19,200
kite is now listing them in reverse

00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,240
order instead of you know chronological

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,860
then you update the feature it

00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,250
automatically rolls out to all of the

00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:27,990
sites that use it further if you keep

00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:30,390
the feature in your git repo you can

00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:34,620
have multiple branches available and you

00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:37,560
know keep track of them that way what

00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:39,180
else is there that panels does there are

00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,580
a lot of things that panels does that I

00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:44,160
just I'm just scratching the surface for

00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:46,440
you I showed you how you can use an

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,880
argument with views panels can feed

00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,580
those arguments without them having to

00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,300
be present in the URL so if you were

00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:56,760
through panels to pull in some taxonomy

00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,590
term that's associated with a node then

00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,090
you can use that taxonomy term as an

00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:02,850
argument without it being explicitly

00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:05,580
present in the URL so that's useful for

00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:07,410
things like I'm looking at a particular

00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:09,420
region and I want to see houses that are

00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,100
in that region the houses in that region

00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,140
are tagged with a taxonomy term that's

00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,220
the same as the region so now you can

00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:18,090
pull them up based on the related

00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:19,740
information but so without having to do

00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:23,220
a complicated nested view or something

00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,990
like that so making sense so I'm sorry

00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,950
if that you know is you know straight

00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,430
forward straight forward straight

00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:34,590
forward then whoa but if you guys have

00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:40,290
any questions yeah was that one better

00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:41,430
than the module div well good well I

00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,560
hope you guys got something out of this

00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,300
I am available for at least a little

00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,060
while and then I have two long

00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,440
three-hour drive home so please take

00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:53,100
advantage of my time if you actually

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,240
feel like you can thanks again

00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,240
appreciate you guys coming out

00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,990
what about this I can help you like it

00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,920
we have the same problem what would

00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,920
happen if you do lyrics

00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:26,000
let's put the word out

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,180
you

00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:43,110
whether less nos that works the way that

00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:48,270
you do across all your devices HP Slate

00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:50,940
and Weber less HP as a service leader in

00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:52,950
cloud computing all we do is hosted

00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,960
computing to us the cloud is just the

00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:55,980
next generation of hosting and if

00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,990
someone who's been in the hosting

00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,000
industry for 12 years we feel we're in a

00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,230
unique position to really help bring

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,270
these two worlds together these

00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:05,160
different sets of technologies and to

00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:07,500
help companies embrace this new world

00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,510
and this great new tool that allows

00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,090
faster innovation not only is it about

00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:15,260
us being responsive and accountable but

00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,260
