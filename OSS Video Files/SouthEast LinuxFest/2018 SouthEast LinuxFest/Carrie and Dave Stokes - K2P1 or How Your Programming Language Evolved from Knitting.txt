	Carrie Stokes and Dave Stokes
K2P1 or How Your Programming Language Evolved from Knitting

The first truly popular programmed device was a loom for making cloth. From those beginnings many echoes can still be found in your programming language today. This session will explore the fascinating overlap between skills like knitting and computer programming. There are also overlaps between the fiber communities and open source communities. The mentoring and educational paths for both fiber and FOSS take slightly different tracks but there are many potential synergies for those who wish to paradigm with using the clutch. We will explore how the Internet has impacted knitting, why the Finnish are teaching knitting to children before coding, and the true definition of getting stuck in a loop.

thank you all for coming out by the way

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:25,800
to enjoy a little bit early this is very

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,619
developed how your programming language

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,240
evolved from knitting I'm Dave Stokes

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,180
I'm the community manager for maestro's

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,880
my wife Kari our anniversary is coming

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:48,030
up she was a science teacher for 27

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:51,690
years at the middle school so last for a

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,969
while I record with 17 years before the

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,289
US Air Force and down a couple years

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:03,989
drop dates until finally the decade in

00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:06,020
1991 30 disappeared today and we're

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:13,110
still in production now

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:14,930
that's know from now let me get fired

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:22,979
off another project and called you back

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:25,290
five years ago today and they called you

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,130
up in the year 1618 and saying they

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,060
wanted to make this released I've been

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,060
to be able to fly over here

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,570
many cutters from the ancient Egyptians

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,729
for 4,000 years ago or still around and

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,829
still usable by the way this is a

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,509
prediction shocks and you can tell all

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,820
Egyptians have two big toes that's why

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,190
they

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,190
[Laughter]

00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,710
appropriate

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,710
[Laughter]

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,290
[Laughter]

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:49,090
[Laughter]

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:12,310
[Laughter]

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:50,550
[Laughter]

00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:56,840
I won't get into much more detail later

00:04:51,889 --> 00:05:00,510
big change in the past decade or so if I

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,510
know you the Knitting is really shifted

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,970
down it's no longer your granny shawl or

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,820
Afghan that they're making there's a lot

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,810
of limited designs

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,880
independent yarn dyeing and

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,880
manufacturing is now a major business

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,010
the materials are better the tools are

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,620
better the access to information is a

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,140
lot better it was all facilitated by one

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,680
website in particular that will be a

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,680
little bit later

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:47,910
[Laughter]

00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:24,440
[Laughter]

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:54,660
[Laughter]

00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:06,509
so you'll see across these are basically

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,889
rotting knitters going from yarn shop to

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,719
yarn shop the art shops will gather one

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:17,340
location and then be invaded by the

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:20,070
various knitters are the various fiber

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:25,889
shows will have people from the sheep

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:27,840
industry the Mafia folks and the village

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:32,750
raw materials all brought together for

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,750
consumption I thought Peter conference

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,790
[Laughter]

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:25,130
[Laughter]

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,030
[Laughter]

00:08:45,290 --> 00:09:41,430
[Laughter]

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:44,339
so this is the page recom the site is

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,839
everything

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,940
right attractive has lots of cute

00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,480
animals on it I'm not quite sure the

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,480
pink stuff

00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,340
together

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,320
[Laughter]

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,320
[Music]

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:31,770
[Laughter]

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:55,570
[Laughter]

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,690
[Laughter]

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,520
[Laughter]

00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,329
one of the neat features about revelry

00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,519
is that various fiber arts and show off

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:37,959
their works in progress you know what

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,559
they're working on get comment get

00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,779
feedback they also can catalog the

00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:47,529
pockets they're working on and the stash

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,059
for you - is basically a room in your

00:12:47,529 --> 00:13:08,439
house with something been taken over by

00:12:49,059 --> 00:13:11,039
yard you can use in PDF format all sorts

00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:15,160
of patterns and you can contact other

00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:18,459
pattern contact the author a good idea

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,939
to get help get suggestions library for

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,369
projects and you can also discuss the

00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:30,399
projects lots of links to social media I

00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:32,230
can also find out a little bit you can

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,689
buy to help make your fire burning

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,519
better database search so you can say

00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,439
okay I have this type of yarn and I want

00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,419
to make this type of project i'll

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:43,329
complex's this and be able to search

00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:47,879
down pare down via a smallest of

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:52,029
patterns to go for and it's a very

00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:53,410
international website and since 2010 the

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,239
fiber arts communities really had a

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,449
revolution or rebirth based around this

00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,449
website

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,740
[Laughter]

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,950
[Laughter]

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:54,360
[Laughter]

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:16,670
[Laughter]

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:23,470
[Music]

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:23,470
[Laughter]

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:41,650
[Laughter]

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:49,930
[Laughter]

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:13,020
[Laughter]

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:36,350
[Laughter]

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,719
[Music]

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:59,190
[Laughter]

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:28,830
[Laughter]

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:45,480
[Laughter]

00:20:49,410 --> 00:21:15,060
[Laughter]

00:21:34,690 --> 00:23:13,570
in here on the grass you have a gap

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,570
there repeated another piece of fiber

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,870
2200 years ago it goes down to lift up

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,049
those very longitudinal pieces of the

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,049
fiber and if there was a hole the hook

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:34,610
one through if there wasn't a hole

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:37,279
didn't go through much like tolerance

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:39,500
punchcards the IBM made famous if you're

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,500
over Stern ated like I am and he has to

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,799
program punch cards you can actually

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,799
encode

00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:22,629
which is how they started out there

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:58,230
[Laughter]

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:12,620
[Music]

00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:12,620
[Laughter]

00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:27,390
[Laughter]

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:57,850
[Laughter]

00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,850
[Laughter]

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:17,410
[Laughter]

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,109
[Music]

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:47,060
[Laughter]

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,970
[Laughter]

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,650
[Laughter]

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,540
[Laughter]

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,070
from how the world differs from the open

00:27:51,290 --> 00:28:01,790
source world and some things like

00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:04,750
appropriate a lot different okay

00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,750
there's no TV

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,230
new patterns are heavily quality shirt

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,780
if your designer you have to realize

00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,430
that you make for you has to scale down

00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,850
has to scale up

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:22,640
so whether goes down on an ARM processor

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,790
or a multi core intel pod box you have

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,070
to make sure it works for everybody

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:31,010
collect all the different sizes doesn't

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:37,880
look funny when you shrink the size down

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:42,620
or just go when you scale it up is it

00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:54,350
consistent between the various sizes so

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:56,420
you have to figure out how she usually

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,520
gets a handful folks to take her pattern

00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,860
and they're all different sizes and she

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,240
supplies materials and they go out an

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,920
integer pattern and when they find

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,960
problems they'd have a feedback loop and

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,060
that's how they do to their they say if

00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:14,320
you later work thousand dollars in cost

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,320
with their time

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:44,290
[Laughter]

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,450
[Laughter]

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:32,830
[Laughter]

00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:06,889
the lady we're talking about her name is

00:31:04,749 --> 00:31:12,159
that's not her real name there's not a

00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:12,159
mr. mrs. Walton or Wooley

00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:22,759
the 2018 knitting designer the year for

00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:27,109
the first craft award what sort of

00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:30,440
processes choose this and she said open

00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:33,320
source software for all my production

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,289
she's dug in for graphics and he's

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:40,299
really break off her sweet to do a lot

00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,299
of things like charts maddox and layouts

00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:50,149
the one thing she mentioned is a lot of

00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,950
software called stitch mastery which is

00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:54,080
kind of clunky not where you can get

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:57,139
true type fonts from stitch mastery for

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,899
their mic for their their character set

00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:03,019
and other things that that's a copy of

00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:10,429
the data the very scary character said

00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:12,320
she can get out there do so other

00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,969
estimates tough like PDF readers

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,559
burgeoning collage building email stuff

00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:19,749
like that

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,749
the only thing she's powerful

00:32:21,470 --> 00:34:13,399
and it's a software and it's in the Ruby

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:17,360
on Rails these texture change but

00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:22,429
getting larger you're not using magic or

00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,429
s3 force or images so

00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:57,309
[Laughter]

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:29,580
[Laughter]

00:35:37,300 --> 00:36:23,900
[Laughter]

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,219
[Music]

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,900
[Laughter]

00:37:02,460 --> 00:38:10,270
with testicles probably talking about

00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:16,839
some of his work from this horror

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:20,760
stories no or so and one called my be

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,760
discovered by intellectual property

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:42,430
[Laughter]

00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,730
[Laughter]

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,139
[Laughter]

00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,139
[Music]

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:28,110
[Laughter]

00:39:54,790 --> 00:40:04,060
[Laughter]

00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:20,150
[Laughter]

00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:35,850
[Laughter]

00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,580
[Laughter]

00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,370
[Laughter]

00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:39,450
the fiber world first act of mentoring

00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,119
you may have seen the fiber room down

00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,820
the hallway they had five or six people

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,580
show up no skills and they walked out

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,650
after a couple hours of tutoring being

00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,900
able to produce submitting projects

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:53,460
they're not masters of it there's a

00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,560
learning curve there but they were

00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,530
instantly brought in and taught how to

00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,940
do you show up at available and excuses

00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,359
group thing they're not going to teach

00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,270
you how to build kernels right away

00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:08,130
better attention paid to novices they

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,560
really really take care of the newbies

00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:13,760
getting around speed you show up at your

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,760
local meet up.com

00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:18,040
unless you really really really have pay

00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:19,840
attention to the new beats they feed her

00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,180
well you're gonna go through and read

00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,320
the manual anyway so we do a little bit

00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,070
along the way but most of the emphasis

00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,670
is on the new beating it up more respect

00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,280
for everyone there's no telling people

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:36,010
RTFM per unit I'll explain that later if

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,870
you want there's a lot of things in the

00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,130
computer world someone has a question as

00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,090
oh you could have messed it up by just

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,430
reviewing the manual

00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,160
well the manuals 800 pages of

00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:49,390
incomprehension Jewish and tends to

00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:54,430
drive away a lot of people is having a

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:56,950
point calm the computer depending on

00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:00,540
yourself branch you might be able to get

00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:04,900
a good answer on slash dot org or maybe

00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,280
Stack Overflow it's real funny is from

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,020
the database world Stack Overflow to

00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,370
kind of looked at as a finder disaster

00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,670
because you have people who are giving

00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:14,770
advice and opinions based on eight nine

00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:19,060
ten years ago their experience when they

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:21,280
set up a wordpress site once you go to

00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,870
court or calm and be the paintings from

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,870
photo to thought they stop the website

00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,850
if you're the community you have one

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,820
place to go that's going to give you a

00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:36,040
great answer we don't have that any

00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,510
other thing it's better comradeship my

00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,920
wife and these ladies here from the

00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,050
Dallas area they go to coffee shops they

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,690
have a group meeting and they're very

00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:49,800
welcoming and bringing people and

00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,940
actively seek out people to help and

00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,450
even the most friendly luck that you go

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:57,970
to it's gonna seem like a cold distant

00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:01,650
iceberg compared to these folks usually

00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,650
have coffee drinks around and food

00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,230
