K2P1 or How Your Programming Language Evolved from Knitting

The first truly popular programmed device was a loom for making cloth. From those beginnings many echoes can still be found in your programming language today. This session will explore the fascinating overlap between skills like knitting and computer programming. There are also overlaps between the fiber communities and open source communities. The mentoring and educational paths for both fiber and FOSS take slightly different tracks but there are many potential synergies for those who wish to paradigm with using the clutch. We will explore how the Internet has impacted knitting, why the Finnish are teaching knitting to children before coding, and the true definition of getting stuck in a loop.
