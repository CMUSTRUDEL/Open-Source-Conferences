Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	An in depth overview of the possibilities of SNMP. How to monitor your environment using SNMP.
Learn what you can do with SNMP and what SNMP can do for you within one hour. Most aspects of SNMP are addressed. Getting the information, setting values, but also how the information is presented and the difference between the OID and the MIBs.
In this presentation I’m trying to make SNMP “simple” again and understandable for everybody.
