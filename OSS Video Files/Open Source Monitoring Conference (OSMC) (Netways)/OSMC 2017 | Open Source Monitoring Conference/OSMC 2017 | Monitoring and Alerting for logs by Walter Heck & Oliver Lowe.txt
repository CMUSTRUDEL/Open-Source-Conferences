Title: OSMC 2017 | Monitoring and Alerting for logs by Walter Heck & Oliver Lowe
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Many of us are using elastic stack with logstash as a way to gather logs in a central place and parse them into understandable information. Throw on Kibana for root cause analysis and Grafana for beautiful dashboards and the picture is almost complete. But there has been one thing missing: monitoring logs for issues and taking action on them in icinga. This has recently been made possible by the logstash output for icinga (https://github.com/Icinga/logstash-output-icinga). This not only allows us to raise alerts, it also allows us to do things like schedule downtimes and add comments to hosts. In this session weâ€™ll explore the possibilities brought on by this new logstash output and show you some examples of what you can do with it.
