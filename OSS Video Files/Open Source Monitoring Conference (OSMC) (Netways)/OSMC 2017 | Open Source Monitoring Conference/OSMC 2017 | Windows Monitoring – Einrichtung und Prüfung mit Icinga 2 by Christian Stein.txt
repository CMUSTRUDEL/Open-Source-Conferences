Title: OSMC 2017 | Windows Monitoring – Einrichtung und Prüfung mit Icinga 2 by Christian Stein
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Even with an open source monitoring solution one cannot avoid proprietary systems completely. The Windows monitoring is covered by Icinga 2 with its own agent, but how can it be deployed to hundreds of systems without actually touching each system? How does Icinga 2 assist me, and how do I monitor my Windows systems? This talk will show deployment possibilities of Icinga 2 agents on windows, and bring examples on how to perhaps improve its` monitoring.
