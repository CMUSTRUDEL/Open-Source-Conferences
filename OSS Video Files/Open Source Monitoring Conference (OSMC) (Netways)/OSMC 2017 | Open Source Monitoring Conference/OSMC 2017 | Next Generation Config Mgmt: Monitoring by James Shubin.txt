Title: OSMC 2017 | Next Generation Config Mgmt: Monitoring by James Shubin
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Mgmt is a next gen config management tool that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
Three of the main design features of the tool include:
* Parallel execution
* Event driven mechanism
* Distributed architecture
The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.
This presentation will demo both and include many examples showing how monitoring is built-in to each resource, and how events can cause the system to react and fix a problem before your pager even goes off.
Finally we’ll talk about some of the future designs we’re planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
A number of blog posts on the subject are available. https://ttboj.wordpress.com/?s=mgmtconfig Attendees are encouraged to read some before the talk if they want a preview!
