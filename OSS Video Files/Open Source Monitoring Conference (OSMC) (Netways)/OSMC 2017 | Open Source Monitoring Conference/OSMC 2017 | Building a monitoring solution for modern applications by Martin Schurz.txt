Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Modern applicatons require modern monitoring solutions that can react fast on changes in the monitored applications (think of autoscaling, updates). And after many years our old monitoring system, based on Nagios and Cacti, was not holding up anymore. This talk tells the story of your journey from our old system through defining our requirements and multiple tool evaluations (Zabbix, Prometheus, Icinga2) to our current impementation based on Icinga2. I will also show some of our implementation details and how we solved problems in our deployment.
