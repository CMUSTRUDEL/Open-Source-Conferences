Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Which monitoring- responsible does not know this or similar questions? How could a CRM fall-out remain undetected for hours, despite profound monitoring? Why do we have 3000 events in the console even if everything works? In monitoring- projects there are always multi-layered problems and challenges, and the causes may be of technical or non-technical nature. The goal of this talk is to present field-tested approaches and tips on how to identify the causes by analysing the environment and thereby deducing countermeasures and strategies.
