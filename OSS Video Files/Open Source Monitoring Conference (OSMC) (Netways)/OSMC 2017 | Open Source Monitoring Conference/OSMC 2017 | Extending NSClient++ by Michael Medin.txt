Title: OSMC 2017 | Extending NSClient++ by Michael Medin
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	A beginners guide to extending the NSClient++ monitoring agent using the REST API and Python scripts (I really hate Lua so I wont cover that). Some basic python and REST knowledge is probably good but apart from that we will start at the basics. The goal is to have some audience live hacking during the presentation so please feel free to big your computer (with curl installed) along and some great ideas on how to botch my demos! Also please note that given the nature of demos this sessions might sadly end up with some Lego(TM) free sections but I will do my best to include as much Lego(TM) images as possible as backgrounds in terminal windows insteadâ€¦
