Title: OSMC 2017 | Another year with OpenNMS by Ronny Trommer
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Built on an event-driven architecture, OpenNMS monitors applications and networks at an enterprise scale. Developers can configure monitoring workflows and data easily using the ReST API. OpenNMS is developed under the AGPLv3, so it’s completely open source.
In this talk, I will discuss improvements we’ve made in the last 3 major releases of OpenNMS Horizon and what is in the development pipeline for the next major release.
