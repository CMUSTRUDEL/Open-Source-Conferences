Description: 
	Now that you have your logs centralized within your IT Infrastructure, what’s next?
With an increased sophistication of cyber security attacks, it’s imperative to have measures set in place to detect suspicious activity. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to analyze DNS data to build dashboards, streams, and alerts using Graylog, an open source log management tool, in unison with open source log shippers.
DNS, as one of the most unknown protocols, gives you deep insights about activities inside your network without the need of active agents on every device or deep package inspection.
