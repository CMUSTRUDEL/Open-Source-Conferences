Title: OSMC 2017 | Icinga 2 in a 24 7 Broadcast Environment by Dave Kempe
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	I will present some war stories and implementation details from our Icinga2 deployments into television broadcast environments. From plugins we needed to develop, to challenges in effecting change in staff practices I will walk through the projects and share my experiences on the way.
This will be a useful talk for anyone looking to run a monitoring project and the approach used to get management and general staff on board.
Then we will cover the implementation of distributed monitoring in Icinga2 with strict firewalls, building dashboards using Nagvis and integration of Opsgenie for alerting.
In addition, the process of training staff and using the Windows Agent installer to deploy Icinga to various windows servers will also be covered.
