Title: OSMC 2017 | Automatisiertes und verteiltes Monitoring in einer CI Umgebung by Bodo Schulz
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Integrating a Blackbox Monitoring into a fully automatic Continuous Integration / Deployment environment can be challenging.
The talk shows which techniques are used. The underlying structure should also be sketched out and explained.
I would also like to present my own solutions, which are available as OpenSource. An automatic Icinga2 Master / Satellite or a service discovery developed for Java applications.
