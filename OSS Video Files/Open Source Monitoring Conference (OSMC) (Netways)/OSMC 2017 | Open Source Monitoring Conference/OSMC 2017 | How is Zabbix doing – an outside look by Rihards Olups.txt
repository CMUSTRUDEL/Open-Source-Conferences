Title: OSMC 2017 | How is Zabbix doing – an outside look by Rihards Olups
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Zabbix is an opensource monitoring tool that has been rapidly evolving during the last few years. We will talk about the growth of the product and look at it from several perspectives :
- technical – how Zabbix has developed functionally, important decisions made
- project management – which processes help to improve the software quality and which ones help less
- community – how open is Zabbix and how that has changed over the years both towards more and less openness
The talk will illustrate points made with examples from the Zabbix community as well as from an extensive Zabbix use at Nokia.
