Title: OSMC 2017 | With a little help from…the community by Alba Ferri
Publication date: 2017-12-04
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	When we think in Open Source, we can’t forget the fundamental essence that sustains it, this is the Community. From my point of view, Icinga2 has shown to have a great and generous community, that has helped me to customize the monitoring platform of Vodafone Spain, in a fantastic and optimal way. I would like to share with you the different approaches we have choose to monitor such a heterogeneous environment.

	00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,869
alright welcome back our next speaker

00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,970
has gained a lot of experience in the

00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,340
monitoring world with lots of different

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,170
positions currently she is working for

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:35,450
Vodafone Spain

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:39,260
so please welcome Alba ferry hello hola

00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:42,290
hi everyone I gotta tell you that I'm

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,940
super excited to be here not in my best

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,480
dreams I would a dream to be given a

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:50,210
talk today you'll see why in a bit when

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,190
I was talking with Bern in late June and

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,900
he proposed me to give a talk for the

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,900
open source monitoring conference I

00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,240
freaked out I was like well in the world

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,280
can I talk about that can interests you

00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,050
guys I mean I have you been in the

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,810
monitoring world for a couple of years

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,070
and I'm sure most of you has been a big

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,950
part of your career working on

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,070
monitoring but then he gave me an idea

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,770
and after 30 minutes of thinking I had a

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,810
nice list of topics I could talk about I

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,609
was so happy

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,189
nevertheless when I read again that

00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:24,380
least I realized that I was not going to

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:26,390
talk about my work I was going to talk

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,969
about yours I was going to talk about

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,840
how much I learned of my singer from the

00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:36,229
community by the way my name is salvo

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,090
ferry I'm a network engineer and I was

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,749
the admin of one of the monitoring

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,710
platform Vodafone Spain uses the monitor

00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:48,950
oops this is the monitor their systems

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,950
way it happened to be a singer and I say

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,490
I was cuz I changed works a couple of

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,429
months ago and I'm now I I'm the product

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,709
manager of a small Spanish company

00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:03,409
called a 3-second that develops

00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,939
monitoring solutions so who knows if

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,060
I'll be talking about my product here

00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:10,009
next year ok but this is my official

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,160
presentation but I would like to tell

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,900
you a little bit more about me I don't

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,270
know if you're aware that network

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,750
engineers may do not have any idea about

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,300
systems and that was exactly my case I

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,160
just happen to like Linux curse

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,580
a couple of old computers I wanted to

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,980
give a second life so three years ago I

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,710
had user level understanding of Linux

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,080
but I guess I was in the right place I

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:39,350
at the right moment when my boss offered

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,630
me to join the monitoring team which I

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,240
obviously accepted so I ended up

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,090
creating my first batch script in the

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,040
summer of 2015 go figure

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,000
do you think do you see what I think

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,370
it's kind of crazy for me to be here

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,250
many open-source communities or server

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,450
solutions have a lack of feedback

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,240
especially from big companies and

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,250
Vodafone Spain is one of those big

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,380
companies that uses I think that so I

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,750
want this stuff to be a feedback talk

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,990
for the open-source community to show

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,700
you how important your contributions are

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,050
do you remember that I just say that I'd

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,440
join the monitoring team

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:22,430
well that team became just me by the end

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,160
of 2015 so at least in my case again it

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,739
would have been impossible to do my work

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,860
without your help ok what am I going to

00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,690
talk about first I'll introduce you the

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,060
monitoring platform we use in phone

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,270
phone I'll show you a what we monitor

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,980
how we monitor then I'll explain you the

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,380
conventions I'm going to use through the

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,820
talk and then I'll show you the

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:49,370
different use cases I think as a nice

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,450
bill we have a similar architecture

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,350
similar to this a bunch of systems

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,860
interconnecting with each other

00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,440
filling up databases doing backups

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:04,280
exposing all kinds of web services it is

00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,080
an interesting ecosystem for oasis we

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,290
have Windows Red Hots

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,940
- Larry's send servers we even have some

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:17,330
hp-ux servers with we use Delta sees EMC

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,500
storage cabins for virtualization we

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:23,720
have Citrix

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,750
being where hyper-v we use IBM MQ as our

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,740
message technology and we have also grey

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:35,030
Oracle Microsoft SQL MySQL and we use

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,110
crystal web services so we have a little

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,740
bit of every systems knowledge

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,650
here the monitoring team is inside the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,200
IT operations department and you can

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:50,490
guess what the other teams are street

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,730
tricks UNIX windows backup database they

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,590
all manage the infrastructure at the

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,700
production environment and of course we

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,740
have building CRM business intelligence

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,720
provisioning they all manage the

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,010
applications at the production

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,100
environment Vodafone Spain has two main

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,350
local data centers so we say single we

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:19,590
monitor all the hosts and services that

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:22,890
are there as as we migrated from na

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,920
gears to icinga we still use an RP and

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,770
NS client angel agent inside the servers

00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,230
but many of the latest monitoring check

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,470
with develop work more in the white box

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,500
monitoring mode we also do passive

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:42,480
monitoring so traps are integrated into

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,960
a single like passive services so the

00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,480
platform is formed by seven servers two

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,850
of them are in the master zone four of

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,030
them are in the satellite zone and the

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,320
last one is for the standalone database

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,750
even though we don't have a big

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,440
infrastructure we monitor around a

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:04,290
thousand hosts 400 of them are Windows

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,540
Server and more than 500 are unix-like

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:10,350
servers and the rest are cabins

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:13,500
appliances or container host for passive

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:16,770
services these thousand hosts have

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,950
around 20,000 services some of the hosts

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:26,100
can have only 10 services and others

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:27,960
more than 100 when I was preparing the

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,670
talk I showed the presentation to a

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,310
friend of mine who doesn't know much

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,860
about I think and so he was a little

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,690
confused with the code sometimes so I

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,180
had to stop the presentation as playing

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,280
him of the record how I think I works so

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,420
he told me to users more breakdown for

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,400
better understanding

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,500
and being this the open source

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,840
monitoring conference and not and I

00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,540
think I went I assume that most of you

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,900
have have worked with I think I singer

00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,740
but many not all of you so I hope it

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,420
helps you understand the examples from

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,040
the moment of someone asking you for a

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,110
new monitoring check to where you

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,240
finally see it in a thing a web there

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,180
are many steps in between but I think

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,190
the most important ones are are this at

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,530
least in terms of doing stuff in

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,600
anything that first you need the script

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,750
that will tell it the information that

00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,960
you need then you have to define a check

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,900
command that will call that scripts with

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,720
the arguments needed then you have to

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,330
define a service that it will call that

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,220
check command and maybe pass variables

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,220
that will be substitute into the

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:41,910
arguments and finally the service gets

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,840
into the hosts okay now we are getting

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:50,130
to the interesting part of the top right

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:53,240
all these use cases we are using for

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,400
monitoring inside the Vodafone explain

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,890
monitoring platform some of some of them

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,530
are more techie some are just a story

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,160
but all of them have been important in

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,510
my journey on learning about I think

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,440
first I will talk about being where

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:14,550
active monitoring then will see an

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,960
implementation with the icinga API then

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,730
we'll talk about I think iWeb 2 theme

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,720
then we'll talk about monitoring log

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:27,780
files the fifth one is windows console

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,830
certificate monitoring check and the

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:35,930
last one is black box story okay use

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,760
case number one VMware active monitoring

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:42,750
historically we were monitoring vmware

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,480
platform out of SNMP traps once the

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,780
vCenter triggers a trap it gets received

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,920
by a singer and if it matches an SNMP TT

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,760
completely then it raises a change stage

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,410
into a passive services I guess many of

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,829
you were doing it

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,079
wait maybe some time ago the problem

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,819
with passive Services is that you don't

00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,829
know you have a problem until it's

00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:11,279
already there so that is not very

00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:14,910
productive a year on some ago UNIX team

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:19,019
had a project to upgrade vSphere version

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:21,209
from 5 to 6 and inside the project it

00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,120
was a training included and I was lucky

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:28,410
enough to get to the training so I went

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,620
there and then I realized that really

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,860
VMware platform is formed by a V Center

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,689
that manages the ESXi hosts that are the

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,050
ones that really has the VMS and data

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:42,389
stores and so on ok and so I went to the

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,430
course and it was pretty interesting but

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,279
of course there's always time for

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,800
boredom so one day I start searching in

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,860
internet about monitoring VMware and

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:59,610
guess what I found this called blog post

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:03,930
here Martin smoothly explains with a lot

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:07,800
of detail how to use check VMware ESXi

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:11,160
browser screen and I thought it that it

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,610
was a good way to monitor VMware

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,370
platform so I follow all the steps in

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,220
the blog and I install all those perl

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,319
modules my god what a pain how many

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,370
models you need to install to make that

00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:28,910
clean work but it all went fine so now

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,380
is when the breakdown comes into play

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,959
you know you can monitor many many

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,060
things with this script I just brought a

00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:40,889
couple of examples of what we do in

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:43,889
Vodafone I wanted to monitor the list of

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,920
ESXi hosts for a particular VM so I was

00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:49,529
using the check VMware ESX Perl script

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,630
then I had to define that said command

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,730
that were called that script with the

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,490
arguments needed in this case there were

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,769
runtime and this host and pay attention

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,579
to the second line when it says import

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:04,649
vmware ESX DC one thing very cool about

00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,230
how I think I works is that you can

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,449
import other parts of code already

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,750
defined so in that tech common

00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,939
definition is where you have

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,740
in the arguments the IP address and the

00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:20,839
credentials needed to access vCenter

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,300
then you had to then I had to define a

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,170
service that will call that a check

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,389
command and I passed a variable with a

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,600
macro host the name of the vCenter and

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,949
in the last line you have the assigned

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:40,269
role there is a great I think

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:43,279
blog post from guna boy dinner called

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,259
avoiding common pitfalls when using

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,230
apply rules that I wish I would have

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:51,430
read before because there you can see

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,040
how powerful these apply rules can be

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:57,699
okay and finally you have to add the

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,430
variables to the host so the service

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:03,740
gets into the host and here's the result

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,360
you can see all the different yes ex I

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:13,430
host that be Center a PP dash SSB was

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:16,339
managing okay the second example I

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:20,240
wanted to list the BMS that were in a

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:23,209
particular ESXi host so again I was

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,970
using the same scrape it has more than

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:32,920
600 lines so thousand so you can do

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,449
everything with this so I needed to

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,250
define the check command that will call

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,110
this trip with the arguments needed in

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,240
this case runtime and lease VMs and

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:47,029
again in the second line you have the

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:49,250
import being word ESX so post and that

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:52,279
check man definition has in the

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,259
arguments the name of the ESXi host that

00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,629
you are accessing and at the same time

00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:59,449
that check command also imports being

00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:02,410
were ESX DC they saying that we were

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:05,709
seen before the has the IP address and

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:11,870
credentials to access their be Center

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:14,870
then I defined the service and I used

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,379
the assign rule and then I added that

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,679
variable to their host definition

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:24,729
here you can see the result you have the

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:30,069
list of BMS and its status not wearing

00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:32,829
that particular ESXi host okay I use

00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:36,549
case number two an integration with the

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:38,679
icinga API I guess we were very good

00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:42,399
clients of being work because we ended

00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:44,049
up having a we realized suit in case you

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,239
don't know what it is let me tell you

00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:50,079
very briefly that is a software solution

00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:53,619
that helps you build and manage hybrid

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,599
cloud it is similar to OpenStack but you

00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:58,929
realize has the security layer

00:13:55,599 --> 00:14:01,539
implemented there is a very cool video

00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:03,909
in the VMware YouTube channel for the

00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:05,909
world we realize an OpenStack as a base

00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:10,839
I look that explains you all the

00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:13,599
differences and so um the UNIX team

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,059
created different VM templates that you

00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:19,269
could request and then you were asked

00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:21,369
for how many virtual CPUs ram storage

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:24,609
and how many days you wanted that

00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:28,709
machine to be on for you and after some

00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:32,049
minutes the machine was ready to use so

00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:35,889
after some days playing with a very life

00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:39,009
solution my UNIX pal came and he asked

00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:41,470
me did you say that I think I had an API

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:43,089
and I was like yeah I'm happy you

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,179
mention it that's one of the main

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:49,720
reasons why I upgraded the platform last

00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:51,879
month guy Michael do you remember how

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,239
many times I post in a monitoring portal

00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,569
I was upgrading everything went fine but

00:14:55,239 --> 00:15:00,569
that day I ended up crying of happiness

00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:04,720
but that's another story

00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:07,209
ok but he will realize has an

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,129
Orchestrator module that you can set

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:11,859
different actions when requesting a

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:14,229
template and those actions can be

00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:17,499
whatever uncivil playbooks puppet

00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:20,679
manifest or just simple core calls so

00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:23,379
what he wanted was to be able to monitor

00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,059
in icinga automatically the PM's

00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:29,769
creative will they be realized

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:30,790
so this time I didn't have to do much

00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:34,240
and I think

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,090
I only had to create the API user for

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,130
the we realized server and then tell him

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,820
the different color codes he had to send

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,100
so here you have a short short resume in

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,910
the I think I do log with the coracles

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,900
from the we realized server creating and

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:56,260
then deleting the host once the machine

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,110
was destroyed and was just machine

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:03,580
create about it we realized I think it's

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:06,370
super cool to be able to monitor things

00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:09,010
on runtime without restarting or

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,990
reloading all the comfy right so I'm

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,030
very happy I'm the open source

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,180
monitoring conference so I can find out

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:20,320
what other sober solution work the same

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:23,890
thing okay use case number three I think

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,290
iWeb to the same when working in a big

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,780
corporate there are many chances there

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:31,780
is that there is an inside marketing

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,970
plan for MPGs to feel part of it they

00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,280
may give you stickers with the name of

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,950
the company or maybe you have to use a

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,290
mouse pad with the logo or they give you

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,010
umbrellas or t-shirt when you know what

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm talking about

00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:48,070
so one day when I was going to login

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,500
into our citrix portal i realized that

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,660
they have changed the look at field now

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,400
you can see a picture of our building

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,730
with the colors of the company and it

00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,450
looks so good so then i remember about

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,000
that i think up blog post announcing the

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:07,270
theming feature with the christmas trees

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,670
the coolest a theme with a snowflakes

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:11,949
flying all over the screen I'm sure you

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,370
can remember that so I thought it would

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,400
have been a good idea to have my own I

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,800
think a web theme and I guess that day I

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,260
was not in the middle of working much I

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,959
had some unknowns I had to investigate

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,570
but everything is working right so I

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,220
started reading the documentation to

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:32,380
create the theme and it was not

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,660
difficult at all so you have to go to

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,380
this path and here you have a couple of

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:42,160
files that create the logging web face

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,249
so in my best base that list I added the

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,820
different colors that I wanted to use

00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:51,940
and in the login doubtless I asked my

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,610
Citrix part if they would lend let me

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,509
use the picture he took of the building

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:02,169
and I use it with different colors and

00:17:58,509 --> 00:18:05,070
it look disco but that is not the only

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:07,749
thing you can change in I think a web

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,879
remember when you log in you get the top

00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:12,580
banner in blue with the logo with I

00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:14,289
think you can also change that and for

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,659
that you need to go to this path and

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:22,919
create your own theme file which I did

00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:26,919
Vodafone - s not less and that creates

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:30,340
inside looking field and so here what I

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:34,539
did was use a small Vodafone logo at the

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:37,749
top right and then I use a gradient tone

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:41,289
of red and instead of using the red

00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:44,049
color of the Vodafone logo I use the

00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:46,330
same thread as the critical state to a

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,909
lighter one that it looks much better

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:55,169
and it was something like this and I

00:18:48,909 --> 00:19:00,009
think pretty cool so I think creating

00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:02,499
creating your own corporate theme can

00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:04,629
make people kind of feel like they're

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:07,149
more the monitoring solution is also

00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:09,070
part of the company so if you're working

00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:11,200
on a big corporate and you haven't

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,490
created your own theme I think you

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,799
should be starting right now

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:20,110
it'll it takes 30 minutes okay use case

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,600
number for monitoring log files what a

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,369
nice topic right having wanted to talk

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:30,309
about monitoring log files for a long

00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:32,919
time how do you monitor log files our

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,440
approach was kind of like this a scrape

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,200
will search for a pattern into a log

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,850
file and when it finished reading it it

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,999
will say the last line breath into a

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,769
temporary file and if it will exit the

00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,080
way you had to do if it has phone a

00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,179
critical pattern then it will accede to

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,369
if it has phone a warning pattern will

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,059
except one no button found an exit zero

00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:56,919
okay in the next execution the first

00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,500
thing it will do it will go to the last

00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,659
line red

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,059
file and then start reading the log file

00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:04,510
from that line to the end and then save

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,100
that new last line read overriding the

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,679
previous value and then it will exit the

00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,409
way had to do if it has found a critical

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,330
pattern then exit to if it has found our

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,730
warning pattern I'd say one no bottom

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,390
front exits you know it seems like a

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,570
good approach right well it is not

00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,429
cursed

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,250
imagine that we are having an

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:28,400
application with problems and that

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:31,730
application writes an error lines and

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:36,230
error line in a log file but does not

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:41,090
keep on writing that line so that line

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:44,059
is only going to be fined once so in the

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:48,770
next execution it will change the state

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:51,200
to zero and with only five minutes there

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,940
are many chances that the operators the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,250
people who is watching the console will

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,669
miss it and even though if they don't

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:01,370
miss it if it changes to okay they can

00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:04,340
think the problem is solved but we all

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,590
know that it's not solve at all why why

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,220
are we using this approach because when

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,250
using Nagios our console wars HP

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,679
openview so that means it is an alarm

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:22,250
console and then when we change to I

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:24,460
think we had a state console so we

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:28,659
needed to find a new approach so I star

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:32,240
certain in the internet in and I phoned

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:34,549
check log files from console live Perl

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,640
script you know that's creep right no I

00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:40,100
really I really like it it has so many

00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,070
options but the one that I really like

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,580
the most is the sticky with the sticky

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,860
you can set up how much time you want

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:52,340
that script to keep it's exiting the

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,950
same way once it finds a pattern so just

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,980
what I needed but there was a problem I

00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,900
couldn't make it work but no surprise

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,409
here because my lack of scripting

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,740
language bliss it was Perl so let me

00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:08,840
tell you sir here when I joined the

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,700
monitoring team so I was working with

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,490
someone else

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,909
my my pal hey Vito who really was the

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,730
one who did the migration from nagi's to

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:21,100
I think he thought it was a good idea to

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,740
say that Vodafone Spain was using I

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:27,039
think I mean I think the web but the

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,279
boss was not so convinced and while he

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,429
left by the end of 2015 and after some

00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,309
months the boss did not tell me I

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:39,580
shouldn't do it well I just didn't ask

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:42,659
him but that's a short detail and so I

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:46,269
send the testimonial to the to the web

00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:48,850
and you know what happened people

00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:50,919
working inside for the phone from other

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:55,389
countries start writing me emails asking

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:58,090
me about I think so I ended up being I

00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:00,309
ended up talking often about monitoring

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,559
with a guy from Czech Republic by the

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:05,740
way in Vodafone Czech Republic they use

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,210
I think nurses and so this day that I

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,500
was so stuck with the script I thought

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:14,679
about asking him so this is a short our

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,960
short conversation that day hi

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,289
Pavel cuca I hope you don't mind I share

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,080
a conversation and well he gave me the

00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:27,190
hint to make this script work like I

00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,370
want it and so let's go to the breakdown

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:34,179
I was using Czech log files script and

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,760
as this was inside the unique server I

00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:41,970
only had two other command alias in the

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:45,039
inner PE dot CFG file and then I had to

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,250
define the service with the arguments

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,500
and the assign rule and then add the

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,299
variable to the whole city nation by the

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,279
way as you can see we were using it to

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:59,769
monitor Postgres database log file and

00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:05,649
here you had a result so now we use

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:08,139
check the files to monitor our ok I use

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:10,929
case number 5 the windows console

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:14,139
certificate monitoring check do you know

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:17,620
it's come the windows know the Microsoft

00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:20,559
monitoring solution God every time I

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,440
hear these can only be monitor with scum

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,460
I roll mice and that was

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,330
sadly my case Vodafone Spain wanted to

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,320
monitor the dates for the different

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:36,250
certificates that were installed in

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,769
Windows beetles servers and someone said

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,919
it was a default about that stuff so I

00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:45,039
went to talk to my pistol pulse and

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:49,840
adjust them how they see the dates of

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:55,299
the certificates so they open a window

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,659
and yet another one and another one and

00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:02,259
I was like oh but where's the command

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:05,409
and they tell me with big eyes like come

00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:07,090
on what are you talking about remember

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,889
one when I said that I had to use a

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,620
level understanding of Linux when I know

00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:14,350
less than that for Windows when I was

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,649
playing with this I login into a Windows

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,789
2012 server and I didn't know how till

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:25,269
enough anyway of course there was a

00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:28,389
command you can use this portal command

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:31,450
with a pipe following asterisk and you

00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:33,970
get all these data so in the fields note

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,860
after not before you have the valid

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,940
dates for that certificate

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:42,700
so I created a poker shell a script that

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,429
would go to the different dates and then

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:50,950
compared to the thresholds and then I

00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:56,080
define them the command alias for that

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:59,110
NS dot ini' file then I define the

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,350
service that with the arguments and the

00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:07,269
assign rule this is some more fancy one

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:10,360
and then I added the variables in the

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:12,100
host definition and here you can see it

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:18,580
well you don't see much because it's on

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:21,159
okay so I'm sorry about that okay use

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,049
case number 6 this is the last one don't

00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:32,169
fall asleep yet listen as I said before

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:35,049
in Vodafone Spain we use IBM and cue

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:37,010
technology as Armitage as her message

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:41,630
technology

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:46,650
but we needed to change from having

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:49,380
triggers brokers clients servers to only

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,290
have a couple of appliances one in its

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,510
data center with a couple of queue

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:58,470
managers inside of it that would manage

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:01,230
all the cues and we had a big challenge

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,130
here because we had to monitor the

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:09,060
appliances and guess what they are great

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:11,910
and powerful black boxes the only way

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:15,360
you could login into the appliances was

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:18,480
using SSH but there was no way to

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,220
interchange in SSH keys and of course

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,920
not even thinking about installing any

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,670
agent so we were kind of stuck here

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:30,840
until I found that there was a github

00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:33,900
repo from the IBM people and here they

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,570
have some examples on how to interact

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,720
with the appliances and you know what

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:42,840
they were using they using they were

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,910
using expect I don't know if you know

00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,000
about aspect I I learned what it was

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,060
that day expect this and kind of all the

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,600
interactive scripting language that some

00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,570
network admins used to use to configure

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,610
errors routers and switches and so on is

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:04,860
like the father of ones of all kind of

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:06,900
so they were they were using Specter

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,120
scripts that were called by passion

00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,550
script and I didn't want to use tor

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,940
scripts to do the same thing so I put

00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:18,510
the small aspect part of the script

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,610
inside the bossy script and it went like

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,670
this

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:26,490
with respect it will open an SSH session

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:29,610
to the appliance and then it will wait

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,620
for the opinions to ask for the login

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,960
then you send a login then wait for the

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,080
past one tense and the password then you

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,960
enter to the Advanced Mode with nqc life

00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,620
and then you put the command that you

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,470
need in this case the status of the high

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,900
availability group and where they was

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,250
most more it's more interesting was that

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,910
you can say

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:56,850
if the answer into a temporary files and

00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:03,690
then you exit so the rest of the basket

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:06,060
it was to parse that file so again we

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,570
have the second McCue cluster script I

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:12,780
great then you have to define that check

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:15,870
command with the arguments needed then

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:19,560
you have to define the service and I

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:21,810
added the assign rule with a variable in

00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,230
the host definition and I added that

00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:27,120
variable in the host and here you can

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,860
see the result even though it's in

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,080
Spanish it's pretty easy to understand

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:37,050
it says okay the state of the cluster is

00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:39,240
only the next example we wanted to

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:42,600
monitor the performance and ease in it

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,820
was kind of similar to before but do you

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:53,340
just use a different command that is

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:56,700
status and you save it and well again

00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,260
you use scripts then you define a check

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,210
command and I guess I was in a hurry

00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,030
that day because I put everything in the

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:07,200
same command line but you can use it

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:10,650
this way too it works great and then you

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,860
have to find the service and I was using

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:17,270
the same variable and it gets supplied

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,910
to the host and this was the result

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,630
we were also monitoring the queue

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:27,270
manager states and the queue States in

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,960
every queue manager and also the message

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,670
h of every of the queues but I didn't

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,400
want to bore you too much and I just

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,500
haven't brought those examples but if

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,630
any of you are interested to know more

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,580
about it I'll be in the conferences this

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:46,230
couple of days so if you see me you can

00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,720
ask me without any problem and now that

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,900
we are at the end of my talk I don't

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,610
know if I have been very quickly talking

00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:59,670
or not but I want to tell you again

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:03,440
thank you because I had a great time

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:07,340
learning about monitoring bow scripting

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,920
I work about I finger and I kind of felt

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,310
a little in depth with you so the other

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,770
day I created my first project I think I

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:20,330
changed and I uploaded the windows

00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:22,940
console porcell script in case anyone in

00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:25,940
case anyone would like to use it so now

00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:30,370
I can say that I really feel part of the

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,370
icinga community thank you very much

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:44,840
so we have some some time for questions

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:50,540
if anyone has any question I have you

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:55,700
thought about using SSH pass for lock

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:59,030
into the session instead of expect I'm

00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:03,140
sorry SSH pass is it's in wrap around

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,100
this edge so you could use username and

00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,770
password mm-hm

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,020
I think we couldn't use it because of

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:12,020
security reasons the UNIX team didn't

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:17,210
let us use it I think it was because of

00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:23,780
that why you use inspect yeah yeah yeah

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:26,960
but maybe maybe we didn't explain

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:29,780
ourselves better and as long as it was

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,180
in the github report they I guess

00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:41,240
thought that it was the right way to do

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:43,000
it but once you use SSH key pass can you

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,190
interact also

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,190
[Music]

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,819
[Music]

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:31,090
yeah okay we should discuss that just

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,230
how many people are using the single app

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,390
interface then because you said you are

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,160
like at a certain moment the only person

00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,140
and I think probably you are in charge

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,870
of setting up everything but then how

00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:52,400
many users did you have and for the

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,900
interface and also how did you separate

00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
responsibilities because in your

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,870
presentation you said you had like the

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,240
citrix team the storage team probably am

00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,300
and some other teams

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,880
how did did everybody get all the alerts

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,000
or did you make it per group but like

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,760
maybe the storage on the virtual machine

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,159
is going critical who got that alert was

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,230
it says admin interests in charge of the

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,270
system or was it the storage team

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:30,440
because eventually they need to grow the

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:34,810
storage all the IT operations department

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,860
had access to I think I was in at least

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:40,550
everyone in the company that would like

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:44,300
to and so we created a roles for every

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:49,210
team and they could see the services

00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:52,399
that were that they administer okay so

00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,980
UNIX team could see all the alerts and

00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:01,610
be stole teams only their services and

00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:04,340
well sometimes if the service was

00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:06,380
administer but by someone but it was

00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,880
important to someone else you that

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:13,190
person could also see it and then the

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,910
operators also could go to the console

00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,590
and then the technical people that was

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,300
his level one that it was not from

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,210
Vodafone the outsourcing company there

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,610
was resolving level one issues they also

00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:30,320
could see the the console had their own

00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:34,940
role and then I try to empower everyone

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,750
to use the console I mean even that the

00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,359
administrators sometimes

00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,530
don't want to see it the monitoring

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:46,500
solution I always try for them to

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:50,640
understand what they were solving in

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,609
what the operators were seeing because

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,680
if the administrator says says that it's

00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:59,250
solved but you can still see the

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,640
critical the operators one close that

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:05,609
ticket so I always told them that they

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,640
had to be sure that in a singer there

00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:12,660
was okay because otherwise it won't work

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,720
and I went to develop the new monitoring

00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,390
scripts with the people that was written

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,730
asking me the the scripts because I mean

00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:24,750
the monitoring is for them is not for me

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:27,720
so I even put the same exact line that

00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,640
they needed and if they needed a path to

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:35,640
know that the problem is there then I

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:44,970
put the path I mean it's for them do we

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:49,050
have any more questions yeah hello in

00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:54,530
such a big company do you you some SEM I

00:36:49,050 --> 00:37:01,140
get to a store all the versions of your

00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:02,700
changes or to you you have to deploy a

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,290
new version or something like that or

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:11,490
some manual tasks or yes we had a

00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:16,410
development environment and we try

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:19,619
things and nothing too much because in

00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:24,599
such a big company we don't do so many

00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:27,599
changes so that first and only upgrade

00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:34,080
that I made it it was a super challenge

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:35,430
for me it's all manually alright so I

00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,710
would have one more question have you

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,660
have you considered using some central

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,690
logging management instead of checking

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,290
log files like elastic stack or gray log

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:48,619
or something

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,619
yes I did demo

00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:56,359
pre-production environment and they with

00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,510
love stash I was sending the alerts to I

00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,930
think I and it went really good but we

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:06,349
wanted such a small feature that having

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:12,170
all that kind of Alka stock for just

00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:15,260
monitor I don't know 150 log files maybe

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:17,660
it was not worthy and well elephant's

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:22,220
pain is not like the most open source

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:25,309
company so all these changes were kind

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:28,190
of difficult every time I have to

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:32,270
explain this to the boss I did what at

00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:34,880
what I could all right then

00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:37,490
thank you very much other for this

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,260
presentation and these insights thank

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:45,919
you

00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:45,919
