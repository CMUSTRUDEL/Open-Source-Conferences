Description: 
	Dashing or rather Smashing is an awesome Monitoring Dashboard, but itâ€™s a pita to deploy. This talk will document the efforts we went trough to make the deployment of both dashing and the dashboards fully automated. It also will show how we test these dashboards using docker and how we build these pipelines with the JenkinsDSL.
