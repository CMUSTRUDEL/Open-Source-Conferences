Description: 
	Well, I guess if I don’t get beaten up by the folks at Netways for presenting an alternative to Icinga, I certainly will be for the title of this talk. But my #monitoringlove for this software is just too strong! After suffering from Nagios for too many years, discovering Sensu saved what was left of my mental health. It also allowed us at freistil IT to grow our web hosting infrastructure without worries about check delays and scalability nightmares.
Sensu just went into its sixth year and counts big names like Yelp, GE, GoDaddy, T-Mobile and OpenTable to its large user community. In this update of my OSMC talk from 2014, I’m going to explain the basics of the Sensu monitoring framework and the advantages of its distributed architecture. Attendees of my talk will not only learn how easy Sensu is to use for health checks and metrics collection, but also what its current limitations are and what’s coming with Sensu 2.0 (aka “sensu-go”).
