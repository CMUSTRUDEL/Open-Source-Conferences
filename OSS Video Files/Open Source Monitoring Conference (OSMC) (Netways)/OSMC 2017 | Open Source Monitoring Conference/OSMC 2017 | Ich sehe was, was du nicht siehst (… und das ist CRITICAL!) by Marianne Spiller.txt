Title: OSMC 2017 | Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst (… und das ist CRITICAL!) by Marianne Spiller
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	If a department spends most of its time reacting to incoming catastrophes, this is mostly due to a non- existent or not optimal monitoring. Though, what does a “perfect” monitoring consist of? What must be considered in the run-up? And does the benefit justify the effort? This talk will also be a report on my experience with Icinga 2, though not only about integration of hardware, but also about integration of the team. And about interaction and the Icinga Director, the charm of graphs and of contributing to the community, about taking a trip into the world of home-automation- and why “finished” never means “really finished”.
