00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,860
too long so last year I was absolutely

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,040
in time and a couple of people were

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,379
complaining that it's too short so we

00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,010
leave at 6:45 we've finished earlier I

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:54,879
promise

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:57,820
so yeah current state of a singer my

pleasure to do the talk every year a

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,400
short introduction for people who don't

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,070
know me my name is burnt I'm in the

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,140
singer project from day one in my other

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,390
day life I work at net ways and you can

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,479
find me on Twitter using get hash if you

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,340
want to but I also have to say that I'm

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,250
probably only talking about all that

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,100
stuff but there are so many other people

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,380
doing it and I would like to do the if I

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,399
usually say meet somebody of the team

00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,540
it's like this one

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,070
but I would love to take the chance

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,060
because so many people in the room

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,920
working on icinga on daily basis to do

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,110
me a favor and say hi and stand up and

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,939
say who are you that so many people can

00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,450
see which is involved oh I see that

00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,009
energy is going through all of you that

00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,710
worked out super well so you see that

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:51,130
all of them stand up so you can see all

00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,840
the the guys over there like Blair I'm

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,729
doing a lot in the last taken lakhs -

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,859
Marcos quality packaging

00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,109
Thomas elastic guna and Michael core

00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:03,280
development Thomas is doing everything

00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:06,460
and I sing a director Dirk is our AC

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,440
Linux specialist Noah and Jennifer which

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,149
on you and the team doing corner and

00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,730
then Jennifer's doing web Sean my cell

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,800
eric is our CTO and lead of the a singer

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,990
web team so all of them working on the

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,030
daily basis and if I mess the demo up in

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,340
some way it's definitely my fault and

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,950
that you're theirs so they do a great

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,020
job every day so thank you very much

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,020
[Applause]

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,310
so I just have the honor to present it

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,420
what we achieved in the last year so

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,610
talking about the product a little bit

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,049
so just to get an idea who is using I

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,760
singer okay for enough I I'm not

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,569
counting it but it seems like I would

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,609
say 70% somebody and this is absolutely

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,239
okay has no idea what I singer is so how

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,829
it works

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,879
anybody here made him come on you are

00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,349
the reason why I'm doing it in English

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,879
this year the first time because you

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,889
were complaining for five years that you

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,930
don't understand the chairman right and

00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:09,269
means you are here so often you have to

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,739
learn German it's not so hard what you

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,769
can speak four languages right you're

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:19,470
from Belgium you speak French German

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:26,190
Austrian Switzerland thing whatever it's

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:30,540
ripe here yeah very it will bring you

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,040
until 7:30 okay so what we do and this

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,239
is really just a short thing which is

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,500
our strategical orientation so the

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,569
target in general is that we monitor

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,750
anything so monitor any application and

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:45,000
every service in any infrastructure how

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,280
we do it we have our core it's a singer

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,919
- we have the monitoring plugins we

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,620
still use and all the some other plugins

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,010
in the community I singer web - on top

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,720
of it we also kicked out the CGI's they

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,569
are no longer included in the package so

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,280
you can install it this way as well then

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,079
we have modules on top of icinga web

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,849
different modules I will show you today

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,310
also Michael showed a couple of them

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,819
earlier the day and then integration

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,639
which is a very important part for us

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:16,500
because we have these three major points

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,090
for our strategy so one thing is that

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,340
monitoring is code is important for us

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,770
that monitoring is a part of your life

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,599
cycle so means not sending somebody a

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,659
ticket please add me to the monitoring

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:30,870
so for us it was always important from

00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:33,510
the architecture point of view that I

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,280
think it has an API that we work very

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,530
well with other config management tools

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,129
that that bringing your application

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,169
bringing you in for

00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,330
structure into monitoring is something

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,129
happens automatically and that has to be

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,289
done manual because that usually never

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,580
works because at some point you you go

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:50,639
out and have a difference between us

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,939
then making it scalable and secure so

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,679
from day one we took care of having

00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:57,419
everything using SSL Certificates and

00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,729
all that stuff so that was important and

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,219
coming to our estate to integrate an

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,599
extent because we decided that we don't

00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,439
want to reinvent the wheel and say we

00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,239
build our own

00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,489
I don't know time series database and

00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:10,979
our own log management so we always had

00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:12,899
the idea that we built the foundation

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,330
the icing a monitoring core in add-ons

00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,709
and integrations and you use your

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,769
favorite tool whatever it is if it's

00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,539
open source like Greylock or elastic or

00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,679
if it's blank if you go to the

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,009
commercial world and you have enough

00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:27,749
money to afford it so whatever you want

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,579
to choose what what's your favorite tool

00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:31,860
you use it with I singer so it was never

00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,179
our approach to have a single

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,019
installation and we solve all your

00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:39,479
system management and monitoring

00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:40,919
challenges you have therefore we build a

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,309
lot of integrations during the last

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,259
years so all of them are working and

00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:48,179
there are so many outside at github

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,949
which is what we have nowadays that a

00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:53,039
new integration is popping up every day

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:55,159
and people using with weird stuff but

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,479
that's definitely an important part

00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,459
where we put a lot of energy in that

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,439
that I singer works with all that stuff

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,179
it's also effort to keep up with all

00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,499
that because

00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:06,860
tools changing all the time and

00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:08,729
sometimes they break up with the API

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,559
comfortably and we have to make sure

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,719
that it still works but it's an

00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:15,629
important part and it's also important

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,089
for us that our users understand that

00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:20,009
this is our our core concept so we took

00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,569
care of the monitoring and there are

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,019
other tools working super good with a

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:28,199
singer talking about the community a

00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:32,279
little bit we have a couple of users we

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,079
know most of the users we don't know so

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,139
if you are user and you would like to

00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,749
share with us there's a forum you can

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,169
type in it's like doable in five minutes

00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:46,559
I also promote this URL every year I

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:48,930
will do it next year as well so it would

00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,550
be super interesting for us to know who

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,630
is using icinga what are you doing with

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,620
it because we

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:59,730
have no clue lastly we were current very

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,500
interesting submission from Ricardo that

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,570
this telecom is using it in a really

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,640
really large environment I've really

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,560
never seen it in person but I I believe

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,810
him because I'm no impersonally because

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,550
he's also in the team not super active

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,120
right now he was very active in the CGI

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,610
development but they have really really

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,050
scaled out a singer set up I don't know

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,450
what they exactly doing but it's just

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,330
mainly to do something with be DSL DSL

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,800
endpoint and stuff like that so whenever

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,160
you internet is not working it's not our

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,170
fault right to make that clear but they

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,720
do some monitoring and another

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,080
interesting thing the desai singers

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:43,950
running on the ISS yeah that's an

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:47,150
amazing story means it's I think of one

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,280
purpose we can cut this out later on

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,960
interesting they they would like to have

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,580
some monitoring years ago and their

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,550
strategic database at that point of view

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,560
was Postgres and Nagas never had post

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,300
Chris support and the Nou tilts and

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,040
since Michael did it at the time and

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,120
build post Chris support they have

00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,010
choosen icinga and they popped up in the

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,460
mailing list somewhere and we never met

00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,900
them and this year at puppet conf in San

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,670
Francisco a guy approached me and said

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,140
what are you having and what is going on

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,630
in the monitoring and then I asked him

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,280
about 10 minutes what he's doing and he

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,450
never came to a point inside yeah but

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,130
what are you really doing I said yeah

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:29,160
we're working for a Naza in doing that

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:31,380
that stuff so what I singer is doing

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,360
there you can imagine that the

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,340
environment there is not super a child

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,690
they change in IP address every two

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,240
years I guess and they don't have an

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,460
ipv6 problem but I singer monitors

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,500
sensors for a MIDI for temperature in

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,600
binary states is some locks are closed I

00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,050
think it's not the life important

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,940
systems monitored by icinga but fair

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,680
enough he said it really works for years

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,970
they running everything on notebooks

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,910
over there so they don't have any

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,250
service now he told me that they gonna

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,930
ship new notebooks with 24 gigabytes to

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,290
the ISS because they extended the

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,639
lifetime to 20 20

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,420
for I guess and they're thinking about

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:12,279
everything extending it more to 2028 so

00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,490
some more years it's needed that they

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,870
have infrastructure on the ISS I don't

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,040
think it's like a config management

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,990
issue they have but it's a really

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,170
interesting thing I'm having our stuff

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,940
flying around the planet every day is in

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:32,110
some ways cool and therefore I tell you

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:33,519
that another thing which we start just a

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,370
couple of days ago that we want to have

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,620
more meetups locally so there are a

00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,660
couple of I singer meetups happening we

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,220
don't know which is pretty much ok

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,540
because it's the idea of meetups if

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,170
somebody say let's meet and talk about

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,610
Reisinger or whatever thing I would like

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,100
to state if you're organizing a meet-up

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,589
would like to help you doing it means we

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,899
send some package to you some some swag

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,910
some shirts and cups and stickers

00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,259
whatever so it has to be a serious meet

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,610
up not saying you're organizing a

00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,649
meet-up with christmas at home that you

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,920
get a free mark that's not the idea

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,680
it's also a meet-up but if you're

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,420
organizing it wherever in Germany or

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,160
you're from over the world and

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,310
organizing a meet-up we would love to

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,649
support it more in the future and and

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,990
help you say though let us know there's

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:22,750
a forum we help you promoting it putting

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,110
in our newsletter and tell the other

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,970
said this is happening and last but not

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,410
least promoting or a singer camp so we

00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,470
have the third eye singer camp in

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,699
Germany next year March the 8th in

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,670
Berlin we will also have one on the 16th

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:43,209
of no March in New York so if somebody

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,649
wants to go there we can give you a

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,800
cheap ticket but you have to pay for the

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:50,350
flight but I think it's it's definitely

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,720
worth it to go over there otherwise a

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,889
much closer target is going to Berlin so

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,189
if you're able to make it and register

00:10:53,889 --> 00:11:00,370
by 30th of November you get a super 25

00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:04,810
percent discount and now my sales pitch

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:08,769
is over so please register is single

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:11,290
exchange who is using or he has ever put

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,399
a plug in or add-on or theme or whatever

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,300
on a single exchange

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,430
oh there's room for improvement oh I got

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,590
it

00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:24,910
I think exchange we launched it a couple

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:26,650
of years ago as a political result that

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:30,100
we were not able to put icinga modules

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:33,220
on a gas exchange for whatever reason so

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,750
we created out our own stuff but we

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,810
didn't have the time to put so much love

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,750
in it and we now did so we released a

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,130
new one I think on Monday last week also

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,070
a blog post will go out tomorrow to

00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:47,830
promote it more and the cool thing is

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,210
here they don't force the the users to

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,950
upload their stuff for you we can just

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,310
sync it with your github project and

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,390
everything happens automatically

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,790
Johannes worked on the project for a

00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,380
couple of months and also Michael and I

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,970
would like to show you how it worked

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,920
because I would like to promote it that

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:09,910
you use it and put your stuff into it so

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:13,350
let's see if that works I try to find a

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,350
project I have my run book here

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,029
the only thing I would like to show is

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,310
how super easy it is so you log on with

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:29,910
your github account which Jennifer did

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:37,930
or with you're a singer account really

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:41,279
loaded semiotics nooks zero six okay so

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,779
if you logged into it create a project

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,050
which category would like to have it add

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,720
on you put a logo in it to identify your

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,910
module I will delete I will delete it

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,500
immediately after the conference so I

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:59,259
just put some funny logo and say which

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,709
name it is Twitter growth it's my spare

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:04,300
time

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:12,190
senseless project I don't know what the

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:15,670
text meant working whatever crap the URL

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:20,350
to the repository oh damn it

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:23,740
and then you create the project take

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,529
some time and that is everything you

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,149
have to do we sing it every night so

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,519
whatever you release also I did a

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,199
release which is not really usable but

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,970
also automatically all the github

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,440
releases you do are automatically in the

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,850
platform you just have to add the

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,310
project and we have never do anything

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,110
again we sing it every night we have

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,730
your stuff there because we don't want a

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,399
force because it will never work to do

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,079
some update encoding here but it is a

00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,089
really cool platform to promote your

00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:50,350
stuff and show others in the community

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:51,910
what you have done because sometimes

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,339
it's really hard to find it on github

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,839
but what people doing there is no urease

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,300
you don't know which branch you should

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,339
check out so really you don't have to do

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,380
anything also releases are added to it

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,120
automatically and also the search is

00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,939
pretty powerful because if I take some

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,089
you cannot read it but I take some

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:14,550
crappy config word out of it and search

00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:18,759
it it's immediately indexed there's an

00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,769
Solara index database on the bottom of

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,360
it and it really works super cool

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:25,870
they're already plugins in there because

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,610
we migrated all the other stuff you can

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,290
also do see the the techs

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,950
whatever I don't know what what works

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:36,880
here and then you get the results super

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,500
quick so just just use it would be nice

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,329
to have your stuff there on a single

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,329
exchange that's it

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:53,130
right

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:56,190
okay coming to the new stuff one thing

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,720
we have a new Docs page I don't know one

00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,850
of you has seen it we previously had our

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,580
Docs icinga to come and do it on our own

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,320
no Blair and we did it with MCAT ox and

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,840
we have everything under a singer that

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,640
come slash dogs also the main products

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,960
like eye singer to icinga web director

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,810
and all the add-ons you can find them

00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,480
there they are also searchable we put a

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,290
lot of effort into the docs

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,080
sometimes you have the feeling that

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:22,290
nobody is reading it sometimes you

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,930
receive mails really really it's it's

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,000
really easy to install I sing I install

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,490
icinga web so I did it last week and I

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,830
if I can do it everybody can do it

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,330
so it's really easy another thing is

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,020
that we have the packages a single

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:39,020
compartment

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:53,610
my code of conduct violation number one

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:57,030
I write it down so we have that server

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,220
for a couple of years but but now we

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,930
have everything on them so for all major

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,150
distributions we have the packages so

00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,710
the release packages or the snapshots

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,020
which I'm using today where you can also

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,300
always keep up with a master if you if

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,820
you want to do it means warning right

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,290
snapshot warning but you can do if you

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,380
always want to have the latest you

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,560
can use the snapshot packages so what's

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,750
going on on that server that the number

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,160
of downloads we have on the server which

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:30,210
is pretty interesting to see that open

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:31,830
source is really dead so it looks like

00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,680
some stranded people on the airport

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,290
still try to grab some packages but the

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,670
numbers are very clear so in some would

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,140
say about fifty thousand packages

00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,270
downloaded only last Wednesday so

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,560
there's a load going on on the

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,210
server river is really surprised

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,590
installing the coupon and having a look

00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,100
under locks with so many people using

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,570
that stuff so the next month we will

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,770
spend more time to hunt down the IP

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:00,240
addresses and find them because these

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:03,600
are usually the people don't fill in the

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,670
customer form now but for us it's it's

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,590
amazing so seeing so much traffic it was

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,720
not a release day was just a standard

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,220
Wednesday thing about fifty thousand

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,130
packages downloaded from the site people

00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,810
using it all over the world you can also

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,670
create a heat map and see where they do

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:24,180
it it's super interesting I'm super

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:26,340
happy about it okay talking about the

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,140
stuff so what we have we have the

00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,440
foundation which is kind of core

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,620
products I explained to you we have some

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,440
stuff automation icing a director config

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,940
management tools and api's and then we

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,340
focus a lot this year on logging in

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,200
metrics because like I said we we have

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,930
leaf focusing on on integration and

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,320
therefore all these tools are important

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,390
to us and that whole stack we will do

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,040
everything now so I will guide you to

00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,430
everything here

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,350
hopefully and you can see what we're

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,210
doing with current icinga stuff some

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,730
stuff we bring out next week and what we

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,370
currently have and I think some features

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,120
people don't know and we will give it a

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,490
try to the foundation that is our icinga

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,220
foundation how we name it consisting of

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,580
a singer to eight released last Friday I

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,080
guess the plugins and I singer web 2.5

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,420
will be released next Monday the

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,460
upcoming version I think also Michael

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:28,260
mentioned that we now need PHP 7 5.6 we

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,880
did a lot in the basic framework which

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,240
helped us making it much much easier in

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,030
the future so this is our our foundation

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,670
you need as a product and in the core

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,910
itself an interesting feature we have

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,920
with the 2:8 is the CA proxy

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,810
somebody played with it already and

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,700
knows and has an idea what it is a

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:54,090
couple of people so the thing is that

00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,660
all our security and our connection

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:59,850
based is based on certificates and SSL

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,070
and sometimes if it's not problem if you

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,690
have a cascaded infrastructure and your

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,760
agents are not able to connect to the

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,530
master and request a certificate we have

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,730
to do it in some way by hand like using

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:14,550
puppet or your own scripts and that was

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,680
a challenge we hit for a couple of years

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,180
or a couple of months and what we have

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,720
right now and it came out with the two

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:26,580
that ABC our proxy see a proxy so here's

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,670
how we solved it though I think you all

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,430
get it there is a picture of our meeting

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,760
room where we decided in about I don't

00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,940
know two or three days it took a long

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,150
time but it should make clear to you

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,570
what we have done with it what we've

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,540
really done with it so the idea is if

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,730
the agent or some other a singer which

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,500
is distributed requesting a certificate

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,860
update you can just push it to this

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,510
satellite you can reach and they move it

00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,340
forward to the next master right we can

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,960
we support in our case catered scenario

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,660
where you can request your certificate

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,029
and forward it through another I sing

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,499
satellite or master instance

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,929
and then you assigned certificate goes

00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:11,999
back over that marster back to your

00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,649
machine so if you have kind of this

00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:17,369
scenario this would be very helpful and

00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:19,950
save you a lot of work it's it's

00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:23,009
sponsored by Volkswagen and I'm I'm

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,099
happy to name it because it's cool they

00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,719
paid for it they needed it and since

00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,849
open sourcing it it helps anybody else

00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:33,960
and it's fair enough I think to do a

00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:35,669
little bit marketing for them what it

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,339
also brings that you have on demand

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:40,320
series are we can proxy these requests

00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,519
and you can also make outer renewal so

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,950
we don't have to take care about your

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:46,049
certificate stuff manually you can out

00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,089
renewal them if you would like to more

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:50,159
into detail how all that works if there

00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:52,139
is something interesting for you

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,299
feel free to get in touch with guna

00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:56,999
which is starting to hiding away or

00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,169
Michael or Shaw they will explain you in

00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,879
detail what you could do with it I don't

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,989
have a demo because I think it doesn't

00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:02,759
make really sense to see some

00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:06,450
certificates flying by in the terminal

00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:09,359
and I also don't know how it works no

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,679
know how it works I trusted it out but

00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,389
it's really cool so if you have that

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,219
kind of infrastructure in architecture

00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:16,619
of your monitoring environment this is a

00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:18,599
really cool feature so give it a try and

00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:23,190
ask us questions we can hopefully answer

00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:27,179
them going to automation I sing a

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:29,999
director so Thomas is mainly responsible

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,619
for our singer director and usually if

00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:37,019
he is coming to the office on Monday it

00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:38,549
looks like this so when are you

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,349
releasing it what is the new features

00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,529
what are you doing

00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:45,239
and the reason is that if you tell you

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:48,599
now I support this then five minutes

00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:49,710
later you support something else so if

00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,469
we would like to learn more about a

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,710
singer director I think current releases

00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:57,239
1.4 the two is that right Thomas gives a

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,659
talk tomorrow I have seen a couple of

00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:03,149
his slides and ideas for the talk so you

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,539
should go there some interesting things

00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:10,950
that we have native support and import

00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:13,169
for vmware e6 these template usage is is

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,729
pretty cool but more about icinga

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,129
director because I have not nothing

00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:18,629
about icinga director and my talk visit

00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,500
Thomas talk so if you'd like to see

00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:24,540
about

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,010
more about it go to store tomorrow sorry

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,890
if i disappoint somebody would like to

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:32,600
see more about director yeah question of

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:36,990
time I'm good and time are kind of

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:40,050
another thing important for us is config

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,970
management support released a couple of

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,410
new modules for puppet

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:48,930
I think version two for a single web and

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:50,910
also for icinga two this year they are

00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,650
also officially approved by puppet right

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:55,590
now so if you would like to use them

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,510
feel free also chef there's a lot of

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,860
community work going on so most of the

00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,170
work in the chef area is done by

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,320
somebody else but we are pretty excited

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,700
about it we are also in the chef partner

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,070
program have that cookbook in the

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,800
supermarket and something which is

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,320
planned for the chef cookbook that we we

00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,720
split it up that we also have individual

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,730
cookbooks for web and for core and make

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,250
it more easier to use it

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,660
also ansible is an hour roadmap in some

00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,760
way I don't have a version I don't have

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,300
a time but we know that it's important

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,590
more more people using ansible perhaps

00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,630
we find some solution for management

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,780
configures changes working a little bit

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,940
fast and releasing it this could also be

00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,590
interesting but for us it's definitely

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,660
important to support all these tools out

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,330
there

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,060
another thing is API so if you work on

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,530
that level that API is is interesting

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:49,440
sometimes there's a confusion why do we

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,210
have so many different api's because we

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,890
have rack or a P I which comes with the

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,680
e single core independent from the web

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,630
interface which provides all the

00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,780
mechanisms to create objects to delete

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,080
them modify them we have basic

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:06,180
authentification based on passwords or

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,820
certificates we also have the

00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,910
possibility to to grant specific access

00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,010
to objects but the basic idea would say

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:17,670
for the Co API is to integrate backend

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:21,170
tools on top of it is the single web to

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,550
API which is the API based on your

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,760
authentication authenticated user

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:28,170
because imagine you having a single web

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,720
authenticate against an active directory

00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,980
and specific access groups you would

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,650
like to reflect that in an API so

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,820
we do kind of a front-end development

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:40,720
icinga web 2 api is a good idea if

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,760
configuration management and using

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,720
director also director has his own API

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,330
this is necessary because director for

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,210
example has his own idea about objects

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:53,530
he has his own state his own database

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:55,330
and director needs to know if you would

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:56,679
like to add a new host or services you

00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,059
have to tell him that I'm the next

00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:59,470
deployer run he publishes that

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:01,990
configuration to the server and

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,809
therefore is there's really a reason to

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:08,260
have three api's if you don't know which

00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:09,700
one to use please ask us my goal was to

00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,799
make it a little bit more clear with its

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,480
slide I don't know if it if they worked

00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:18,730
out but we will figure out later

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,919
hopefully okay leaving the automation

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,290
part going to login so what are the

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,080
challenges and the challenges we see

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,059
right now with logging is that at some

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,410
point we would like to access monitoring

00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:32,530
events so we would like to see what's

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,840
going on in the monitoring processing

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,960
external events so some issues some

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,510
events occurring outside the syncro ii

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,370
system for example an SNMP trip or

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,530
whatever how we can deal with it

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,660
monitoring the monitor in some way and

00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,610
also have kind of an umbrella management

00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,410
where you can get a quick view at our

00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,000
logging data have it in the a single web

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,940
and then go to another interface for

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,790
deeper analysis so what we have done

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:02,980
here who's familiar with our with

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:08,169
elastic beats okay I don't know how many

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:10,720
percent let's say 80 idea

00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:14,260
icinga beats are small components

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,419
responsible for connecting somewhere

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,270
shipping information to elastic so

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:21,790
imagine for example file beat or Peggy

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:25,360
beat introspects network packages five

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:27,010
leap goes ships specific files on your

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,830
system which you can configure to

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,799
elastic for ADA analysis you don't need

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,450
these locks - installed locally so I

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,160
think up it's a very lightweight and

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,190
they usually have their own function

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,220
means metric beads or wind log beads you

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,620
can imagine for windows lock and what

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,780
release this via is in a singer Pete so

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,240
what the I singer beat us and it's

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,190
- to know that the icinga beat is an

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,310
independent component could

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,710
theoretically run everywhere in your

00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:59,410
network and connects to the icinga api

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:02,320
so what it does the icinga bit connects

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:05,230
to the single API and based on the

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,660
configured parameters deals with events

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,120
and put them in elasticsearch I will

00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,400
show you how that works later but

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,780
important is that you have to start a

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,560
single bit as an individual component

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:20,290
connect to the API and work with it

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,720
events you are interested in another

00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,310
cool thing is the lock stitch output so

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,950
if you're working with locks - you know

00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:30,940
that locks - has so many outputs the

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,060
only way to interact with icinga was the

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,910
old nagas output where you have to write

00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:40,110
something to the command file

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:42,850
nobody really sober wants to do it so

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,290
log stitch gives you the locks - output

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,800
gives you a much better possibility

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:50,650
using the single API and creating and

00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,990
dealing with external events and what's

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,630
really cool if you get an event for an

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,310
existing host or a server so imagine you

00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,630
get an SNMP trip somewhere and you would

00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,420
like to edit through the monitoring and

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:03,640
deal with it you can just put it in but

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,620
also if your service does not exist

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,300
because you never know that it exists

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,460
out there the log stash output

00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,640
automatically uses the core API and

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,200
creates that services for you so an

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,710
event you don't know that is occurring

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,710
is is handled by the log stash output

00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:24,790
and creates the services so who knows

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,900
that this feature exists well that's not

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,640
so many

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,980
hopefully our own people know that it

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,660
exists but I'm not sure but it's really

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,640
interesting because that is I assume

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,350
that a lot of people have no idea that

00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,890
you can do that stuff and I will show

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:43,380
you how that works and before that I

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:46,110
would like to give you a short view on

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,240
the elasticsearch module so what it is

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,730
to solve that umbrella management idea

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,080
is that directly into icinga web you

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,680
have a chance to connect through

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,020
elasticsearch database whether you using

00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:00,840
elastic stack or using Greylock you can

00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,060
directly connect to it you can configure

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,450
patterns and see everything every

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,310
related data in the elastics like

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:15,920
related to your hosts in the icinga web

00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:15,920
without leaving the web interface both

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:30,140
so chairman what so-and-so saw is a

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,870
chairman what so usually if people don't

00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:35,899
do anything they yell I would saw every

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:38,529
half an hour because then you assumed

00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:43,130
they had did something before right

00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:44,899
later more and more coming through the

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,250
talk meets us complaining that I'm not

00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,159
doing image now I'm doing it in English

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,710
and now we have problems we can so what

00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:58,309
what can I do

00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:02,809
Spanish okay yeah I'm going through that

00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:05,990
first of all I try to show you a singer

00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:07,190
bit a little bit so the configuration of

00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,220
a singer bit is pretty straightforward

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:12,140
you can go to the right now the packages

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,490
are still on github so then ordered at

00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,730
the packaging server right now we said

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,880
correct letter right yeah so you go on

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,380
get up by singer I sing a bit you

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,980
download the packages install them and

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,950
then they configure under EDC I sing a

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,110
beat there are a couple of example

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:37,279
templates for it and I go to the singer

00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:40,390
be diamo and I'm kind of type yeah I

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:48,110
father I've also issues so what happens

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:50,390
so it is not the first time so the idea

00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,340
of the icing a bit because I I told you

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,350
before a singer beat can run somewhere

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:57,830
in for infrastructure that you configure

00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,380
your I singer API host say where it's

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:04,669
running here in my example it's local VM

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:07,159
the port the user password if you skip

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,770
SSL verify and then the more important

00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,539
thing is that you can configure the kind

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,279
of events you are interested in means

00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,630
these kind of events are going on in

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,399
your monitoring right there's a check

00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,649
result coming in some state changes

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,970
notification or you would just be

00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:22,490
alerted if somebody sets an

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,889
acknowledgement so for whatever action

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,630
happens in the monitoring you can tell I

00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:28,789
singer B this is what I'm interesting in

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,149
I would like to know if somebody removes

00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,219
the

00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:33,739
time for example because you have a lazy

00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:35,899
admin who doesn't care and say ok I

00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:37,940
remove the downtime here or whatever of

00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:41,749
these actions you configure them here

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,039
and then the only thing independent from

00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:45,679
different intervals you have can

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,869
configure is where to put it and then I

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,059
syncope directly writes it to realistic

00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:52,129
search instance which is also in that

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:55,639
example configured on my host but like I

00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:57,259
said before it can run wherever so in

00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,570
this case a single bit is running it's

00:31:57,259 --> 00:32:07,909
connected to the core API it's just the

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:09,589
process running here nothing more and

00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:12,200
you can see him shipping data to

00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:15,099
elasticsearch if we go there

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,099
opening Cubana

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,519
you have different indexes reason why is

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,529
that you can separate your data with

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,259
different indexes also have a couple of

00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:28,059
other demos working on the icinga bid so

00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:30,789
what you have with you I think a bid you

00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:32,980
see all the current events occurring on

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:35,320
the monitoring system in that case it's

00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:38,019
just check results coming on which is at

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,509
that view not very helpful I get that

00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:43,239
you can also go in the detail I reduce

00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:45,730
you see more which hosts are responsible

00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:47,259
for different messages definitely get it

00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,889
I have five folks it doesn't make sense

00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:52,239
here right I can count them by hand in a

00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:54,249
large environment this is pretty helpful

00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:56,289
but since you usually don't want to go

00:32:54,249 --> 00:33:00,639
to the discover mode we also have a

00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:03,399
sample dashboard for it one thing is for

00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,989
example the I think a bit status where

00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,119
you can really see how many endpoints

00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:08,710
are connected you can see the amount of

00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,269
service checks going on the amount of

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:15,460
host checks the few is a little bit too

00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:18,850
small the states of hold so you get a

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,980
big overview on all your data going on

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,049
especially we really have like hundred

00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,759
thousands of services this is it's super

00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:28,679
helpful to get more data analysis on

00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:32,590
your data to give you another example

00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,269
could be the check results where at that

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,980
point of view you gave an information so

00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,509
if we in your production you have so

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,570
many criticals you have a problem as

00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:43,299
well but just to give you an idea you

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,220
can create everything kibana can do this

00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:49,389
it's just an example if you're familiar

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,480
with Cubana it's pretty easy if not it

00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:54,340
takes to someone to learn it but you can

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,899
do whatever you want so the power is in

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,799
the data and you can create whatever

00:33:55,899 --> 00:34:02,379
view on your data what you want

00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,840
also notification is interesting for

00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:07,539
example everything is coming out of the

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,599
beat where you can see what notification

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:12,879
types are going on which server is

00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,950
responsible for it and you can also go

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,740
into the detail and work with the data

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:20,440
on a single dashboard because every time

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,299
we use it and would like to set a filter

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,490
on something and we choose the icinga

00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:26,799
demo host then it filters all other

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:29,200
views right they all belonging to each

00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:30,250
other and they use the same filter so

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,929
analyzing

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:37,649
I think I be set up with the dashboard

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:37,649
is really cool any questions to the beat

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:43,169
okay then the beat goes on yeah

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:57,399
can you repeat the question please

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,399
yeah yeah

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,450
yeah I repeat the question for the

00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,420
cameras the question is what the old way

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,280
was to ship-lock data to elastic they

00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,690
have a various ways so you can also use

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,840
lock stitch install it locally and

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,490
should block files to it there was in

00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,830
Gelf output we have for a longer time

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,170
you can ship Galip output to lock search

00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:23,570
and then forward it but we never had

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,700
that chance to actively excess icing a

00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:29,390
to and getting out the matrix of icinga

00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,160
so locks is more let's say a passive way

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,680
because you get something and then

00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,940
whatever you get you put it into elastic

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,010
so it's perhaps there's in some areas

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,140
it's the same data but it's a different

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,880
approach depend on your needs that at

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,280
some point it's absolutely okay that you

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,830
get all your log files shipped them but

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,390
also if you ship a standard lock for two

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,310
elastic you have to take care about the

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:54,140
pattern match right of the Reg X of croc

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:58,100
filtering and all that stuff so you have

00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:00,770
to take care to to make some event

00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,480
really into valuable data and that's the

00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,590
work you have to do and this way around

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,240
you don't have to do anything you just

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,460
configure we install the bead and get

00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,370
everything in a well formatted

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,680
information to the to the elastic data

00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,390
base and then of course you need a gray

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,700
log or a Cabana to make something

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,560
valuable out of it otherwise it doesn't

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,360
make sense so it's it's kind of another

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,370
approach we also have another thing

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,680
which is the elastic rider which is new

00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:31,700
with I singer to the date but it will

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:33,590
cover that later on okay talking about

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,770
the bead I would like to talk about the

00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:41,750
locks this locks - output so if you all

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:43,130
remember we have information sometimes

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,290
could happen and we don't know that this

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:48,050
service exists and we would like to have

00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:52,160
that information I singer but before I

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:55,840
show you the locks - output I'll show

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,840
you the new a singer web too

00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:02,460
which is a damn it

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,300
as you can see we have a new login

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:10,290
screen yes I love it

00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:13,530
thanks Florian where is he okay off

00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:16,580
already fall asleep that was please say

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:19,920
the energy was here for a second

00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:22,100
so flora did the login screen it also

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,730
works in different resolutions of course

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:30,090
and I log into the icinga web this all

00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:33,770
will be in icinga web 2.5 coming next

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,770
Monday okay

00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,730
thank you

00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,920
another thing before I go to the locks

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
dish you see that we have Dartmouth the

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,470
menu

00:37:47,520 --> 00:38:00,090
we are also something if you need more

00:37:49,470 --> 00:38:01,470
space you can collapse the menu yes I'm

00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,120
also allowed to clap because I'm not

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,060
responsible and I'm really excited about

00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,490
it as well so we can open it again and

00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:14,310
you can also close it again and open it

00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:17,840
again I mean it's really so we would

00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:22,400
like to see it again so yeah okay

00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,400
another important thing is that

00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:29,010
okay okay I don't overdo it so usually

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,570
the main menu points didn't have any

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,550
function because it just helps you to

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,070
fly in the menu they're also in the

00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:38,220
reduced mode now we have four for every

00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,020
let's say major point in the menu we

00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,460
have kind of small overview which is

00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,610
especially helpful for the mobile

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,360
interface you don't need it here we also

00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:50,940
have a new technical overview so

00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,400
definitely more to come on that base I

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,400
don't know if you remember the old big

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,560
tiles we have so there's a lot of small

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,390
improvements in the UI or I would say

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,750
especially means see it big improvements

00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:09,690
in the menu but there a lot of work was

00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:12,690
done under the hood in the basic

00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,060
framework in the icinga PHP library so

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,280
there is definitely more to come in the

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,070
future about that but that's the main

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,420
topic just would like to show it so

00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,470
definitely you can install it on Monday

00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,940
or play around with the snapshot

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:29,640
packages which I did now okay let's go

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,420
to the host I have a host name blog

00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,660
search demo just as a couple of services

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:39,050
which is yeah lower ping SSH nothing

00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,050
fancy

00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:52,300
okay logstash going to the country to

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,730
show you what we have here configuring

00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,650
the locks is Al Aqsa output so in that

00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,540
example because I don't have so much

00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,150
infrastructure connected to my sample I

00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,400
would like to give you an idea what the

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,040
fundamental concept of the lockstitch

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,020
output is so what we have here we have

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,120
one input we have one output and we have

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,910
some logic in the middle so we get the

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,950
input from standardin which is my sample

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,780
to give you an idea how it works we have

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,390
some filters which is really helpful if

00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,370
you would like to convert messages out

00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,710
of log file to an eye single readable

00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:25,390
state that is okay is the zero for

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:29,200
example so we have to do that work and

00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:33,880
then in the icinga output we configure

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,470
the destination the same is used like in

00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,610
the singer beat so we have to configure

00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:42,040
a host user and password and everything

00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:44,050
we configure a host with in this case is

00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,880
hard-coded with locks the same locks -

00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:49,090
demo but you can also take out the host

00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,250
name of your filter or of your incoming

00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:54,250
log files and take that host name as a

00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,150
as a variable because of course this

00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,530
will not work in a production

00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,610
environment because hopefully not all

00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:02,860
your servers are named locks - demo then

00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,780
I have a service which is passive event

00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,090
service right and if you remember we

00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,460
don't have that service in our singer

00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,950
it's not configured on that host and and

00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,510
what we configured here is said at the

00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,880
time we receive something would like to

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,970
to do an action in that case we would

00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,590
like to process the check result like in

00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,300
the I singer but we can also deal with

00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,150
all the other internal actions our

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,860
singer provides so for example reacting

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,140
on some pattern happening in lakhs - we

00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,330
can also configure a downtime we set an

00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,610
acknowledgment so we can deal with all

00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,900
the passive events out there and fire

00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:41,050
out an action and I singer I create some

00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:44,080
attributes and the standardout is just

00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,470
the information I put in does it make

00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,470
sense so far

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:53,910
great I'm not sending anything on fire

00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:56,339
but it makes sense that's cool so I

00:41:53,910 --> 00:42:00,440
start locks the locks - because it's not

00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,440
running because it's my standard end

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:17,500
it takes some time God knows why also

00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,500
other people know why

00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,590
and then just give you an idea I hope

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,390
you can all make the imagination that

00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,340
this usually comes out from a log file

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:31,130
from your messages from your fire or log

00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,470
from whichever source in that case it's

00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,900
just an example to provide this passive

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,540
event so I have just the lochs HTML we

00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,990
see our application where we remember we

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:45,710
match the arrow and put it to a critical

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:48,160
and after my log searches up hopefully

00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,160
soon

00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,550
this is something coming no that's it

00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:07,690
right

00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:07,690
probably using Khan let let's see

00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,180
that's how a live demos working

00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,950
and then going here

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,110
you see the service so immediately the

00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,460
service is created we try to process the

00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,380
result then we figure out the service

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,580
does not exist then we create the

00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,290
service and then we have the check

00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,210
result so now you can deal with

00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,730
everything out there SNMP traps in your

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,930
monitoring airlocks - dummy service

00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,180
whatever - you're a singer and have

00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,080
everything in the interface which i

00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:46,360
think is pretty cool

00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:49,920
and also if you get and info that

00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:54,840
everything is ok you can also put that

00:43:49,920 --> 00:44:01,330
and then to use that everything is ok

00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:05,790
that's it but I think it's cool yeah

00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:09,010
[Applause]

00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:11,320
yeah it's cool but what if I use for

00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:15,430
example that a director to manage all my

00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:18,310
configuration um basically adding a new

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,040
configuration out of nowhere so what how

00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:23,470
how can I make this to work with my

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,690
configuration management interesting

00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:29,980
question so one thing is that it would

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,840
be able to also do it with the a

00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,980
director API if you want that scenario

00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,160
we don't have it right now

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:38,010
another thing is that also you can you

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,470
can work in some work with both worlds

00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:43,000
but right now I would say this perhaps

00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,700
somebody else is the better explanation

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,030
but in my opinion this is a way where

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,380
director is not included it would it be

00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:51,850
a problem Thomas because you're sitting

00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,520
here that we add that service and

00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:57,100
director still does his own logic not

00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,210
really right so you can you can just

00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,490
merge it together

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,080
have your I think a director information

00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,940
and have your passive event information

00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,510
how to create it by the locks - output

00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,280
for example so there's no exclusivity

00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:13,530
demand that you only can use a specific

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,530
tool yeah

00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:20,790
but if I I think such a event has has a

00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:23,520
reason so it's maybe something I think

00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:26,520
when such a even pops up it every it has

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,250
a reason and that's maybe because I this

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,990
is a service which I didn't have

00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:34,200
documented any anywhere and I still want

00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:36,450
to monitor it so there should be a way

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,520
it's cool that is created but this

00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,740
should be also a way so I can tell the

00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,080
overlaying system which actually create

00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,760
my services that there is nothing

00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,210
something new which I have to monitor

00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:52,320
also so some kind of back pipe I don't

00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:55,109
know how to call save the director

00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:00,030
button yeah oh no I know I don't do a

00:45:55,109 --> 00:46:02,280
pull request um no no no chance means

00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,650
yeah technique he on the other way I

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,750
think that in general your configuration

00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,980
should have some way of logic which is

00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,750
somewhere else means in your

00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,790
configuration management your seam DB

00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,440
whatever use dish there should be the

00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,890
heart of your infrastructure

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,020
organization and means at that point

00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,540
it's just an example but I think

00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,480
everybody or not everybody but and a lot

00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,220
of people who have that have that need

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,619
for submitting something which they

00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,410
don't know before and that it's just a

00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:34,320
way means you can also probably deal

00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,349
with log search right some Ruby code

00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,240
triggering the director API wait for the

00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:41,520
next deploy the only thing is that it

00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,970
could take some time and what to do with

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,970
the result

00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:49,910
yeah but imagine you trigger whatever

00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,480
API or you said okay I get a new passive

00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:55,850
event I would let know my master CMDB

00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,530
director that I have a new service but

00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:59,570
it then can take some time until every

00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,740
node knows what's going on but at this

00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,420
time what are you doing with the check

00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:06,500
result means you can perhaps cash it in

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,570
some way I think right now the best

00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,040
thing is to combine it means having the

00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:13,400
information in director and also dealing

00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:19,160
with that as an as an additional idea

00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:23,270
dealing with it events you have you know

00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,540
website sorry so for how long does this

00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:28,940
object exist forever forever okay we

00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:33,230
don't delete it I don't know we're not

00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:35,060
sure the thing is right now is that at

00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,370
the point when we say if it's okay we

00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,470
delete it nobody will ever see that

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:41,300
something happened so I don't know if

00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:43,130
there's the truth and there's the

00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,140
correct way but we think if something

00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:46,580
occurred in some way and bearest we send

00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,150
out a notification or we did something

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,920
with it

00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,720
deleting that service afterwards is

00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,280
perhaps not a cool idea because then

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,900
somebody goes to icinga weapon I would

00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,490
like to search for a specific service

00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,180
and it's gone because we deleted using

00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:00,770
the API but I also get that some people

00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,830
could have a demand for only showing

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:05,240
arrows and then removing it which is

00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,120
technically I would say it's no problem

00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,770
to to empower the locks - output to do

00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,750
that as well and provide that as an

00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:13,820
additional scenario and configuration

00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:17,630
object but right now it's not able to do

00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:20,300
it one short question though this is

00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:24,310
finally successful for the for the event

00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:28,750
DP can we say that Oh No

00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:31,250
yeah functionality was yeah kind of

00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,780
let's say the event DB if somebody knows

00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:36,650
it was created at a time where all these

00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:39,620
hipster tools did not exist and and what

00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:42,020
we had to do to for example D with SNMP

00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,760
is like pitching as an MP TT writing it

00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,030
to a database model and then having a

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,190
view on the event DB still an event DB

00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:51,530
view exists if somebody has that legacy

00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:53,870
method but I think all these other tools

00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:56,270
provides so much more functionality also

00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,040
they are free right or the elastic stack

00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,609
everything also Greylock is open source

00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,319
means

00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:02,989
have some enterprise options like the

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:05,569
expect you can buy but they have so many

00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:07,220
so much power in the analysis that I

00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:09,410
personally would not recommend using an

00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,099
event DB anymore I don't know what the

00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:11,630
future brings

00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:13,430
perhaps somebody here is a different

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:15,980
opinion but I think it's better to go

00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:18,069
this way and also with the next demo is

00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:23,839
I show you how we can bring it back to

00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:26,269
the icinga web because the next thing is

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,160
the elasticsearch module so we have a

00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:32,809
host we have more hosts we have the

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,660
icinga demo before show is there so it

00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:37,869
shows the configuration which I don't

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,869
see

00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,190
yeah Isis

00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,880
what

00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,670
so so

00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,840
the elasticsearch module

00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,770
the elasticsearch model what it does it

00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,900
connects to another elasticsearch

00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:09,119
instance right so you can configure one

00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,850
or multiple elasticsearch instances and

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,940
based on that elasticsearch instance you

00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:18,960
can can can create event types because

00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,940
perhaps for specific hosts services

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,030
environments you are interested in in a

00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:29,010
specific type of events so in that

00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:31,170
example can you read it kind of we have

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,359
two event types so one thing is the

00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:35,100
follow bit all what we just would like

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,080
to see every bead related to the host

00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,550
name so we just have the host name

00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,520
further out of the filter language I

00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:45,840
think I have to provides and another way

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,430
we have a combination so we said the

00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,490
host name must match and also we would

00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:52,740
like to make sure that we only see log

00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,600
information related to secure for

00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,910
example the secure log so we can have

00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,619
multiple of that event types also based

00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,359
on different elastics so you can create

00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:04,890
multiple types of that and how that

00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:07,580
looks like is we go into overview going

00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:10,980
to the host going to I sing a demo and

00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:14,280
then we have an elastic search event

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,570
some hook which is an action on that and

00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,400
here you see in real time the

00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:19,890
information elastic gets for that

00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,990
specific host so every time you ship a

00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,700
lock to elastic immediately it's going

00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:25,290
to be refreshed I don't know every 10

00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,109
seconds right now you get that

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:30,210
information you can select the file beat

00:51:28,109 --> 00:51:32,100
the event type over here which is right

00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,260
now file bit all you see everything

00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,600
related but you can also go to a file

00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:38,670
bit secure and then only see information

00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:43,020
coming out by the secure lock so if you

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:45,500
go to the terminal I have to stop the

00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,500
locks again

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,800
connect to the host which I don't do

00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,540
it perhaps it takes some well but we

00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,890
ships the information with fireweed in

00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:03,010
that example I have a file building

00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:04,390
still on my machine to the Machine you

00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,640
can see what's going on in La Crosse

00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,820
so imagine whatever expression whatever

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,180
event type we would like to see this is

00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,720
also to be honest a very early version

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:18,370
we will pre release it also next Monday

00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,560
more ideas we have is like filtering

00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:22,600
preps making it more clear that you look

00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:25,150
for a specific method pattern giving it

00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,610
color that it makes it more easy also if

00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,320
you want to really deep analyzes you go

00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:32,160
to keep Anna but it just gives you an

00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:35,380
impression also you can have a detailed

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,060
look so on the full object in

00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,550
elasticsearch and you can see what's

00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,050
going on so it it just helps for a quick

00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,540
view to see what's going in a system

00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:45,640
without leaving the interface also if we

00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:48,310
go to the fabula we are still little bit

00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,830
more and we see the may lock and see

00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:56,170
that i'm not able to do mailing on my

00:52:50,830 --> 00:53:00,730
local machine in some way ok I think we

00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:06,810
are good in time I'm it halfway I would

00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:10,560
say ok let's go back don't be afraid

00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:16,000
that's it for the for the logging part

00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:18,190
metrics the metrics thing was important

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,020
for us from from day one so that we can

00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,840
store metrics in some way to another

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,390
time series database forward them to

00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,580
elastic because also elastic is putting

00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,140
more and more efforts in making and less

00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,970
to get more powerful time series

00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,220
database also with time line you have

00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:35,880
very powerful expressions and math

00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:38,380
functions to work with it and also

00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,720
integrate a basic reffing into icinga

00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,270
web without having the need to go to

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,400
graph fauna or some other tool which you

00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:48,370
prefer all the time just to have a quick

00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:51,930
view on a load for example that is the

00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:54,760
three things we we had in mind for that

00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,980
what we have which is which is none of

00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,740
these is new that we have riders for all

00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:02,050
these databases so for prepare data

00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:05,020
which is still heavily used working with

00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:07,180
PHP works super good for graphite influx

00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,559
to be open to these TB so if you

00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:13,470
able to deal with Hadoop you can use

00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:15,809
open DSD be as well or anything else

00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:18,940
which is newest the elastic writer

00:54:15,809 --> 00:54:22,000
something coming with version to the

00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,490
date so a week ago that we can directly

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,730
ship our performance data to the elastic

00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:30,069
search instance what we do is we just

00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,200
enable the feature and ship all the data

00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:35,170
to elastic for later analysis with

00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:37,000
Cabana also graph Anna supports elastic

00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,380
search as the backend so whatever

00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,700
front-end you would like to use you can

00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:46,030
use Gravano you can use Cabana for it

00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:49,180
also sponsored by Wallace book they

00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:52,500
needed let that feature and again thanks

00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:58,960
to them for sharing it with all of you

00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:01,660
yeah they are not here they building

00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,250
cars right now but we tell them that you

00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:05,559
loved it

00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:09,450
and also our new graphite module which

00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:11,920
is also coming out next Monday which

00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:14,680
gives you basic graphs directly in

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,299
icinga web I will show you that in the

00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,190
demo but I also would like to stay this

00:55:16,299 --> 00:55:21,549
is not a replacement for graph honor so

00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:24,670
the idea is not redeveloping Ravana the

00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:26,710
ideas that with the standard checks the

00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,170
standard performance information you get

00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,099
a quick overview for deeper analyzes you

00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,079
can go somewhere else

00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:37,180
but it gives you a short overview and

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:40,869
how that looks I will show you in a demo

00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:43,839
so the elastic writer is nothing you can

00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:52,599
you can see the only thing is you can

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:56,079
see is I sing lastik search the same

00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,700
here we can figure host port the index

00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,650
we would like use where we write the

00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,329
performance data in an important thing

00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:04,690
by default I think enabled sent perf

00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:07,990
data is false you have to enable to have

00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,830
true to to get the perfect perfect order

00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:14,570
into elastic

00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:16,790
let's go to cabana first of all you can

00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:20,330
you see all the information in these I

00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:25,670
singer to index so everything you have

00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:27,050
here it is not super helpful but Cabana

00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,360
had a very powerful visualizations

00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:33,860
rainwork and i would hopefully show you

00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:38,240
how can create a graph in a minute so we

00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:40,340
create i was too fast so we create a new

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,800
visualization object we say it's a

00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:44,480
basing chart it's an area with we say

00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,890
the indexes i singer because this is

00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,430
where we store all the metrics data in

00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:51,500
then we say we need a XX let's say the

00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:57,470
bottom we need a date histogram means

00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:59,060
it's like a time series and then we need

00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:01,970
other metrics for it

00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:08,180
then we choose an aggregation say an

00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:12,950
average say we need a load every minute

00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:16,450
and then custom label for it it's load 1

00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:16,450
then we had another one

00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,650
load 15

00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,460
then we remove that count and we have

00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:35,370
our graph data and kibana

00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:35,370
yeah amazing it's a graph it's living

00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:41,920
means it's just a sample it's no

00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:42,400
template but you can do everything in

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,020
Cabana

00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,030
which is pretty cool as if you have a

00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:49,030
dashboard with graphs and you filter a

00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:51,460
specific graph out all the others deal

00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:54,040
with it so it's you're just a simple

00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:56,310
load you can stack them you can do

00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,930
whatever if you're familiar with it

00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:03,430
don't know that if that makes sense

00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:05,410
but you are super flexible however you

00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:07,920
have to decide if that fits for you so

00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:11,200
if you're a super good graph on ax user

00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,000
absolutely okay but if the ls6 they give

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,330
cabaña is something for you this could

00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:21,010
pretty helpful in a more advanced way I

00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:24,820
have a dashboard for it we see just a

00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:27,910
couple of examples so here's for example

00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:30,310
you can do deviation also with cabana

00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:33,730
logic we can do more of this timeline we

00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:38,860
have these Tahoe meters I don't know

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:41,020
some people love it and also have all

00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:43,150
the load here again threshold so we have

00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:45,190
so many graphical objects you have in

00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:49,240
Cabana and you can work with the metrics

00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,590
coming out of a singer - like I said it

00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,290
takes some time but if you're familiar

00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:57,520
with the with the interface it's really

00:58:53,290 --> 00:59:01,680
really powerful now I forgot what I

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,680
would like to say like to show you

00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:12,370
yes so that's it for the Cabana the

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,370
graphite module

00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,020
I installed the module module

00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:22,670
installation is super easy right now we

00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,810
don't have packages for every module but

00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,520
this is something which is on our

00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,930
roadmap that for every icinga web 2

00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,990
module we also have an our package

00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,610
server a package but it's just we get

00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:35,450
the current release package put it in

00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:38,900
your modules folder unzip it and then

00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,360
you have it in the configuration you see

00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,610
that graphic module where you configure

00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,440
a back-end localhost

00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:47,990
graphite in that case where you have you

00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,030
installed graphite installation what is

00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:53,210
that what's wrong you complaining later

00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:56,930
ok

00:59:53,210 --> 01:00:00,110
I can live with it you just define you

00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:02,350
well and then if you go to the services

01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,350
view

01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:08,960
you get a quick graph here on the right

01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,850
hand side we have our own template stuff

01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,470
we have all the basic templates you need

01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:16,040
for load and disk and all that stuff in

01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,240
there you can also show more and see all

01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,880
that graphs for the disk on the right

01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,950
hand side I know that there are

01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,490
thousands of graphing solutions out

01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:27,710
there it's pretty cool because it's not

01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:30,620
it's no effort so if you have graphite

01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,940
so imagine you have it already this is

01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,960
probably the harder part installing

01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:37,310
graphite but I come to the later you

01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,370
just enable the module they have your

01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:44,030
graphs and what we also have is kind of

01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:45,920
an overview where you get all graphs for

01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:50,060
specific hosts or objects together in

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,500
the single graph so imagine you have

01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,390
specific service you would like to

01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,980
compare them all to each other it also

01:00:53,390 --> 01:01:00,560
works with the standard I think as soon

01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:03,830
takes you say load hopefully it was not

01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:07,880
too fast and you see the new Lord cross

01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:10,160
all your machines it's it's pretty new

01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,900
we worked at four on that for a couple

01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,530
of month also will be released on Monday

01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:17,780
please give us your feedback perhaps

01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:19,760
make a pull request for your templates

01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,350
we would love to improve it more we have

01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,720
some ideas that we're making it even

01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:26,360
more convenient to to play with the data

01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,040
to spell and select specific things but

01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,630
like I said before we have not the idea

01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,150
having a graphical editor where you can

01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,160
decide what the load bar which color it

01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,140
has and all that stuff so if you would

01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,180
like to have that go to graph owner but

01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,450
for a short overview I think it's pretty

01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,450
cool

01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,510
okay I'm done with the demo so far

01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,970
roadmap what's coming

01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:01,830
I think the most funniest thing is this

01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:01,830
year

01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:12,990
somebody somebody from America here I'm

01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:17,980
sorry we have our own problems as well

01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:19,450
but he's too good there is always

01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,450
something coming on with all this stuff

01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:25,359
to do last thing we talked about icinga

01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:27,309
DB somebody if you remember and I said

01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:35,910
we have we will have icinga DB and

01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:38,920
reporting this year we don't have it

01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:40,150
there are different reasons I think the

01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,299
most important reason we didn't have the

01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:46,569
time to do it it's it's still on our

01:02:43,299 --> 01:02:48,160
roadmap so we we already started this

01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:50,140
year we had a couple of weeks and month

01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,660
where we try to figure out how we can

01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:54,880
deal with the monitoring data and not

01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:56,530
metric based sense state information for

01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,780
reporting and all that we have to change

01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:00,250
a lot of components because we have to

01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,650
change something in the core where we

01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:06,099
write out the data I sing a web also

01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:08,260
reporting which is it has to be after

01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:09,880
the new database because reporting

01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,049
fundamental needs the database model

01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,240
right and it doesn't make sense for us

01:03:11,049 --> 01:03:15,460
to bring it in the current version so

01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:19,569
it's still in our roadmap we will have

01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:20,950
it next year and I hope I said I don't

01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:23,049
have to use it and he made it give next

01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:24,640
year but on the other hand doesn't make

01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,079
sense to tell any other stories so we

01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,940
would love to have it right now we don't

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:32,950
have it I hope you don't need it but

01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,809
it's definitely it's deafening issues so

01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:36,609
we have to deal with it it's it's

01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:39,849
something which consumes a lot of energy

01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:42,150
and I hear with promise that we have it

01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:44,380
next year and I can hopefully show it

01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,140
what we will have next Monday we'll

01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:49,119
really I think a web tour so please read

01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,710
all the change logs and information for

01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,900
installing it because of the new PHP

01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:56,740
version you need also graphite module

01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:58,690
and elasticsearch then you I sing a web

01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,190
and especially also the modules need the

01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:04,200
newer version so we have to do something

01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:09,190
so please go through the documentation

01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:11,529
in q1 we will release Noma Norma is the

01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:13,450
notification manager is something you

01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:15,460
can configure all your notification

01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,770
groups and all that like shift Nate

01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:21,730
shift on duty calendars all the thing in

01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:24,850
the web interface we we had on very old

01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:27,640
version years ago and we we already have

01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:29,260
a new one but it's not release ready but

01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,510
we make sure that it's ready earlier

01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:33,130
next year so hopefully I have to look at

01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:37,300
Eric we can show it it I think I can

01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:42,310
Berlin I hope so in March and have no

01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:44,200
more there another thing is that we

01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:46,120
would like and we already did put a lot

01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,140
of effort making icinga installation

01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:52,030
much easier so bringing all that

01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:54,280
components we have regarding the

01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,750
foundation all that modules integration

01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,880
all the thing making it more easy to

01:04:55,750 --> 01:05:01,080
install them keeping up to date with the

01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,190
newest version and making the glue

01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:04,990
fixing and in combining all these

01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:10,780
different components much smaller and

01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:12,460
providing it we it will be pre-built so

01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,410
we have all the packages in the future

01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,030
on our package server we will support

01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,310
that integration it will be fully open

01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:21,460
source so we will you know

01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:23,200
enterprise whatever thing but we will do

01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,730
is that we package some external

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,670
third-party apps for example graphite

01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:30,370
for people having a support because

01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:34,570
installing graphite it could be a pain

01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:37,120
in the ass and we invested a lot of time

01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:40,030
and energy and therefore also money to

01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:42,280
making it much much easier and this is

01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:44,110
very important for us bringing that in

01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,810
next year making it more convenient

01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:48,760
using all these moving targets and

01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:54,040
making it easier what's their question

01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:57,480
somewhere I thought so no ok and just

01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:01,650
talking and I'm I'm close to finish a

01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,650
graphite you have a question

01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,580
do we plant

01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:10,529
if we plan the align the version numbers

01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,719
I would say not yet so we haven't

01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:14,099
discussed it right now we have a singer

01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,170
to rotate at some point we were together

01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,959
but then we figured out that for

01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:20,189
specific needs feature reasons we we

01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:22,259
don't have the same version number I

01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:23,910
don't know if it's necessary I think we

01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:28,079
haven't never talked about it right now

01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:29,459
it's it's not a thing I would say the

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,999
thing with graphite if it's really

01:06:29,459 --> 01:06:35,429
complicated so who thinks he can install

01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:39,779
graphite in like 10 minutes without

01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:42,809
using synthesizer on Ubuntu in five

01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:45,239
minutes okay fair enough

01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:46,619
but it could be complicated installing

01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:48,029
graphite because you have a lot of

01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:50,009
different components we can go all

01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:52,170
through this what you all have - - like

01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:56,489
PIP and pop and all that sing to get

01:06:52,170 --> 01:07:00,829
your pythons components together yeah

01:06:56,489 --> 01:07:03,869
pop is pretty new coming out soon so

01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:05,989
graphite is really cool and and graphite

01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:08,819
as a tool I think it sets the foundation

01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:10,289
that matrix is really a thing I know

01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:12,420
there are so many others on the market

01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:14,339
so in flux TB is definitely also popular

01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,920
because it made all this effort you have

01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:19,109
to put it in a graphite installation

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,059
much much easier but I think still

01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:23,400
graphite sets the foundation using the

01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:25,650
API providing metrics and it's it's

01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,239
really really still a cool time serious

01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:29,400
database which is very flexible and

01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:33,449
powerful but on this installation is a

01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,829
pain in the ass and that is something we

01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:37,550
took care of when I would like to show

01:07:34,829 --> 01:07:40,879
you how we did that

01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,879
[Music]

01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:52,060
[Music]

01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,480
[Music]

01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:19,359
[Music]

01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,319
[Music]

01:08:54,740 --> 01:09:01,649
[Music]

01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:10,770
it only takes two minutes to commands

01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:22,180
yeah real time really two commands it's

01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:24,730
really cool so we already have it you

01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:26,590
can see it because I used it I don't

01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:31,210
know when we have it but I also think

01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:33,780
earlier next year just to do a quick

01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:37,720
recap what we have and what's important

01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:41,710
we have all the things and I hopefully

01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:43,840
was able to show you that I singer is

01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:45,550
powerful but it's really really powerful

01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,230
if you use it with other tools if you

01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:50,320
use it with integrations whether it's

01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:52,690
gray log elastic your favorite metrics

01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,910
front-end database so we hopefully can

01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:57,930
deal with all of them so let's say we

01:09:54,910 --> 01:10:00,130
can deal with all the popular ones and

01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:01,540
that's that's really important for us

01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,720
and that this also will drive us the

01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:06,940
next year so please install from the

01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,200
icinga pitch it sing a package server

01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:11,230
not because we would like to increase

01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:12,970
our number of installed packages or zip

01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:16,960
open zeusian would like to increase the

01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:19,420
number please do it the thing is we

01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,980
would like to have you using the package

01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:22,600
service because that is the thing we

01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,460
working on the databases directly from

01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,610
our champions we push the packages here

01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:29,610
they will always up-to-date so build

01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:31,840
your individual monitoring stack so

01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:34,000
please give us feedback so many of us

01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,190
are here give us your ideas give us the

01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,260
integration you were already rating for

01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,510
it and we don't have it because that's

01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:42,730
our goal that you can probably interact

01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:45,040
with everything you have give us

01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:47,200
feedback so like I said whatever you

01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,600
have let us know and definitely enjoy

01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,920
