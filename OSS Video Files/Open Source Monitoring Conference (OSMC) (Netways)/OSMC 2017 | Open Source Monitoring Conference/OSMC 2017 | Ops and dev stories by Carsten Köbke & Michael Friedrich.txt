Title: OSMC 2017 | Ops and dev stories by Carsten Köbke & Michael Friedrich
Publication date: 2017-12-05
Playlist: OSMC 2017 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	- Integrate everything into your monitoring stack -
There are many tools and possibilities available in the Icinga monitoring ecosystem. Setup Icinga 2 within a distributed architecture, put Icinga Web 2 on top and visualise alerts. Further you’ve already setup your preferred graphing solution (Graphite, InfluxDB, etc.) and Grafana greets you with a shiny metrics dashboard. Log events are processed and Elastic Stack or Graylog add more possibilities to correlate them with monitoring alerts.
Having so many tools requires you to know how to connect them, or simply integrate an existing data source or frontend into your all-in-one user dashboard. Be it Graphs in your detail view, additional log events on a critical service view or yet a global map for location based alerts. Maybe you’ll also want to provide as much details in your notifications as possible, think of fancy Grafana graphs.
This talk dives into existing and possible integrations, and explains why you sometimes just write your own integration. Carsten is the author of the Icinga Web 2 Grafana module while Michael focusses on Dashing and log processing. We’ll catch up with war stories (“meh, nothing exists”) to hero stories (“hooray, users love my integration”) and hope to motivate everyone out there doing the same. We will continue with practical development on Friday during the OSMC hackathon.
