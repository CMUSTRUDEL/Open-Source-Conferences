Description: 
	In correlation with the fast paced technological evolution, software applications have also evolved to become more complex, more distributed and more dynamic. Cloud computing has pushed this evolution a step further. Therefore it is now more difficult to properly monitor application performances and ensure the end user that he will get the high-quality experience he is expecting. Luckily great tools such as InspectIT APM are taking care of the problem efficiently. In this presentation I will introduce you to inspectIt APM and then I will show you how to integrate it to your Spring boot application and how to diagnose, analyse and monitor your application. You will become familiar with the use of inspectIt three main components: the agent, the server and the user interface. You will also learn how to analyse user request from the invocation sequence and detect the root causes of potential problems. You will finally see how easy it is to perform real user monitoring with inspectIt in a production like environment.10
