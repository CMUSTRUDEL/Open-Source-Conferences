Title: OSMC 2018 | Smart Home Monitoring mit openHAB 2 by Marianne Spiller
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	We continuously collect values and state changes, make graphs out of them, initiate processes in subject of them, get notified in many different ways about them –  in summary we can say that our Smart Homes behave as „monitoring our own homes“. So let’s do a live demo of openHAB 2, covering questions like „why using something like this?“ and „where to start?“ and giving you some ideas about persisting and representing collected data.
