00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:20,609
hi everyone

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:24,330
does that mic work okay so my name is

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,390
Camille you can reach me through email

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,720
or Twitter and welcome to the refocus

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:39,600
talk refocus is a one-stop shop for a

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:44,040
monitoring system health let's start

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,309
about me in my kind of meet career I

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,430
work in software for around six to seven

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,090
years I was a software developer I was a

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,239
tester I was an SRE so I did a bunch of

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,789
things the most challenging I guess

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,250
would be an asari role so this is where

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,589
you put a software developer into an

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,240
operation world where you have a lot of

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,490
servers you have a lot of infrastructure

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
pieces where you could never even heard

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,890
of and now this software developer has

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,909
to do a lot of things under time

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,360
pressure quickly so this was the most

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,189
challenging one and I couldn't do any of

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,979
them so I moved to management and moved

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,890
to the dark side so now I'm a people

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,689
manager I love people I love technology

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,880
so both things work work well for me so

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,450
we've before we started to going into

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,400
details for these refocus one thing from

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,000
my private life one thing I would like

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,229
to share

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,840
I love motorbikes ok that's not my bike

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,950
I love this to be my bike that's my

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,729
dream bike

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,490
it's a Ducati XJ oval it's a beast but I

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,899
have a bike I'm based in Ireland if you

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,229
if you look at the Google Google Maps

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,479
and look at Dublin I have five minutes

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,460
to see and five minutes to mountains so

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,959
I take my bike I go to the mountains and

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,879
and relax right so that's me

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,510
by the way it took me nine years to

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,099
convince my wife to buy

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,879
I can bike by your bike so it's not an

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:26,530
easy sell okay so I'll tell you a story

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,689
of how sales force went from being small

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,680
and doing monitoring in a very standard

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:35,200
way to grow super big that's great for

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,049
business but you have to scale all of

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,879
your systems with the growth and we've

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:43,450
been lucky enough to grow really really

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,450
quickly to a huge scale right now we're

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,599
around the into a twenty or more data

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,489
centers around the word which means

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,319
hundreds of thousands of devices or even

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,120
millions of devices of different types

00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:01,560
you know servers network storage what

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,200
you what have you so the story starts

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,720
similar in all companies and there is

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,730
nothing wrong with this approach so

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,150
first we start with some sort of data

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,519
collection metrics collection so you

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,819
might know things like Nagios things

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,799
like collect the those checks can be on

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,500
the server and can monitor your server

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,230
and produce some results or they can be

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,510
sort of centralized and perform active

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:33,160
checks against your against your devices

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:36,340
so it usually starts with one small or

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,709
one big tool and then someone comes in

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,190
and says look for a network we have this

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,410
cool collect dr whatever now we would

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,069
love to use collecti because it's the

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,049
best fit for for network monitoring

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,510
right so we say of course we want to use

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:56,079
a different tool we always want to use

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,209
the best tool for a job all right so now

00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,760
you have two things that you have to go

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,379
look at and check what's the status

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,650
there right so that the natural

00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:07,150
progression from this is to start

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,549
sending your metrics to some sort of

00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,639
graphs right you get some time series

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,949
database you get some historical results

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,440
you could see that something let's say a

00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:21,760
disk space has been running you know

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,979
it's been increasing ever so throughout

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,960
the whole week so now we can see them

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,860
the whole trend we can do something

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,729
about it

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,849
but what happens on the scale well when

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:36,610
you're a big you might have hundreds of

00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:38,199
thousands of those graphs and then you

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,699
start creating dashboards because -

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,530
words are cool right they can you can

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,449
take a look about the whole piece of

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,689
your infrastructure so whole piece of

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,099
clusters and then and dive in but again

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,180
on scale you might have hundreds of

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:54,310
thousands of those dashboards so how are

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,340
you gonna look at that right how are you

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,009
gonna look if something is fine in on

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,270
those graphs or maybe it's broken

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,180
there's not enough humans you can hire

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,039
to look at all of those graphs so the

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,560
next logical thing you're gonna do is

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,610
just set up some alerting right like if

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,199
some some graph is underperforming and

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,430
we know the threshold then you set up an

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,439
alert and and you just get notified

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,360
again if you're doing that for twenty

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,430
servers you know getting ten alerts per

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,069
week it's all good right everything

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,800
works the whole model worked perfectly

00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,719
because you get ten alerts a week you go

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,449
to your dashboards which you have ten or

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:38,650
five you find out what's what's going on

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:41,229
and you react to it but again if you're

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,159
big or very big you might be getting

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,750
tens of thousands of those alerts a day

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:49,330
right so what do you do with a list of

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,150
ten thousands of alerts is you know

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,520
everything broken is nothing broken

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,099
maybe it's an alert noise problem who

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,430
ever worked with alerting my know alert

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:03,580
noise problem it doesn't go away it gets

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,020
worse and worse okay so you might at

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,939
some point you might have ten thousands

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,180
of others that are all fake so if there

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:13,000
are fake people ignore them once they

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,979
ignore those broken alerts whenever they

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,719
become let's say a real real issues they

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,360
will still be ignored so you'll never

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,219
you'll lose visibility because of the

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,310
alert noise problem amplifies with

00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,650
scales so once again this is very

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,479
standard approach you know collecting

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,250
metrics sending this to time series

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:39,130
doing some alerting very standard works

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,180
most most cases but at some point is

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,870
just

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:47,860
is too big right so the first big

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,870
challenge you're gonna get is you know

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,990
how would you visualize those hundreds

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,090
of services that you have so you have

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,800
some graphs you have some metrics

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,740
sometimes you might even have some text

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,990
data like logs and all you want to know

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,280
is is my service healthy or not or is my

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,669
hundreds of services are they all

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,320
healthy or maybe not so how do you get

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:15,250
that from all of those graphs alerts

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,060
dashboards it's very hard so that's the

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:22,870
first big challenge the other big

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:25,180
challenge is you might start buying a

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,639
lot of displays for your engineers you

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,220
might even start buying big screens in

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,259
the room so everybody can watch all of

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,509
those alerts those graphs there's so

00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:37,090
much data right so you want to monitor

00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:39,039
all of that but at some point there's

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,800
just no physical space everyone has six

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,400
screens there is no the screens on the

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:49,930
on the walls and and it's really hard to

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,520
monitor that what you're going to look

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,560
at when you look at your alerts you'll

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,440
have a big list let's say it's five

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,510
hundred well again if is everything

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,580
broken is there a five hundred alerts

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,010
five hundred things that I have to look

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:06,070
at now because they are broken if that's

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:08,320
true well we have a real problem okay if

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,909
that's a real problem what is it if I

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,759
just look at the list I get a lot of

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:15,789
text but like where is the problem how

00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,789
do I correlate what's in the text into a

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,740
bigger kind of more abstract way maybe

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,199
this is one cluster that just shouting

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,070
at me but if I look at the text data it

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,389
might be really hard to correlate that

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,229
so for me as a human is going to be

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,930
really hard and if you put people in

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:37,089
this environment they're gonna be look

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,399
like that and what do we do we put our

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,229
colleagues we put our engineers and say

00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,770
you know here is this five hundred large

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,300
here's all of those graphs tell me when

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,950
something is broken or and you're

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,650
responsible for for fixing it

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,570
right so if I'm responsible for fixing

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,380
it and I can't figure out what's broken

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,050
and I get five hundred

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,970
screaming at me I'm not gonna feel good

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,340
I'm not gonna feel good I'm not gonna go

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,280
to work every day and be happy

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,020
quite the opposite right it's a mission

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,900
impossible in this in this environment

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,630
and that's that's what we faced in some

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,240
stage where everything just grew we had

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:17,710
all systems all monitoring tools and

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,100
this is where we were at at some point

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:24,710
not another great place to be but

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,470
imagine that someone is really good at

00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,270
looking at monitors there is 1,000

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,070
monitors in the room and someone can see

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,770
everything right they're super good at

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,810
this they can they don't need any any

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,340
help of tooling they just can watch

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,670
everything but they look at this graph

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:50,180
here right and it says Network latency

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:53,330
50 ok what is 50 is this good is this

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,670
bad is this that what's causing the

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,650
problem you know I'm I can moyer

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,110
everything that's what I'm good at but I

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,700
have no idea how the network works right

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,880
I have no idea about anything about

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,900
network so how do you know that 50 is

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,310
good you don't know that from a graph

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,350
you're not gonna go to alert because

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,090
alerts are what's something that's gonna

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,410
tell you you know something is broken

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:20,360
afterwards so what actually happens here

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,960
is you have a lot of knowledge

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,090
distributed across a lot of teams but

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,480
there is no central kind of repo that

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,590
says you know this is ok this is bad

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,610
so it's a really hard problem when you

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,810
have a lot of things like this

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,700
especially when you have a team we can

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,970
call it NOC we can call it an SRE team

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,530
but it's essentially a team that

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,210
monitors everything and if something is

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,980
broken it's going to reach out to the

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,160
right team and it's going to try to

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,350
bring the service back so if they don't

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,590
know if 50 is good or not what they're

00:10:51,350 --> 00:11:01,730
gonna do they either ignore it or create

00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:06,980
a false false positive we don't know so

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:09,439
we had to refocus refocus is the name of

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,399
a very tool that we

00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,709
we'd used to be called focus from as you

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,879
can as you can imagine you know you see

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,920
all of those things you want to focus

00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,740
you want to have a better view into

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,379
what's going on the name refocus comes

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,740
from we had that old tool that we try to

00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:32,709
extend so we couldn't we just rebuild it

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:35,420
with API API first with the open source

00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:37,939
spirit in mind so you can take it you

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,290
can use it in your own company for free

00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:44,839
we'll give you support so yeah it's it's

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,629
completely rebranded new tool that's

00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,329
it's open source and and works well for

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:55,850
us so I'll spend a couple of minutes

00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:58,550
explaining that we're solving those

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,550
those problems so first problem is

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:04,069
visibility again you saw all those

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,740
graphs all of those lists of alerts it's

00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:07,899
really hard to know as a human was

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,819
really broken

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:13,309
we also accommodate a lot of data data

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:15,220
types so you can you can help you can

00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:18,619
send us something that says you know

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,929
this thing has a warning state we don't

00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:23,079
care what warning really means but we

00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:26,119
can show you that's in a warning state

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,110
it's self-service so this goes back to

00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:32,179
the API first design everything you you

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,389
do we only focus all of the

00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,720
configuration is available to API we've

00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:41,299
built some UI to help people to to be

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,369
more user friendly but anyway you still

00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,929
can do everything through API if there's

00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,259
some piece of functionality that you

00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,860
can't that's one of the challenges on

00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,799
the scale as well when you have one team

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,740
owning that small monitoring project and

00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:00,110
then that team is being you know is very

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,999
popular and gets so many work items and

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,829
so such a huge backlog that you just

00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:05,869
kind of do anything about it

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:08,449
so adding a self-service option helps

00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:10,040
because we can if you make that easy for

00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:12,649
users they're gonna do it they're not

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,220
gonna ask you and we also scale

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:18,649
affordably and the reason for that is we

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,060
focus shows you only the the real-time

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:22,680
health status what's

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,140
what's right now what's going on right

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,150
now so that means we don't have to store

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:30,540
much data we don't have to store any

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,910
historical data enough helps so if you

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:36,720
add a little bit more points real time

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:40,440
data points it's super cheap right we

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,190
can handle that so those are the

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,110
problems we're solving with refocus and

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,720
the biggest one we can visualize the

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,470
system health in real time so you know

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:56,010
what's happening at right now and this

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,160
is particularly helpful at least for me

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,900
when I have a distributed system a lot

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,750
of things in the pipeline and a lot of

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,160
things talk to each other and something

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,650
is broken right it's something is broken

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:11,160
at the end of your pipe it's not serving

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:13,530
your requests and and now your task is

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,880
ok I've been woken up you know middle of

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,670
night and I need to figure out what's

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,670
broken so in the previous systems I

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,470
would have to look at my dashboards

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,540
alerts and try to figure out what's

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,120
broken but here I just opened up page

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,420
and I'm gonna show in a minute and tells

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:34,380
me yes here that's it that's that's all

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,530
work so that's how it looks like with in

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:39,780
comparison with those graphs you can see

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,970
three monitors with graphs on the

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,920
picture and they will show less

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,200
information that you can see in this one

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,600
small monitor with a bunch of green

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,140
bunch of green means it's good it's that

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,850
easy Green is good red is bad

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,680
so I argue there is more information in

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,180
this one screen than on those three

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,610
screens and it's much more than that

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,520
here's a little bit bigger picture of

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:09,020
this as you can see we kind of grouped

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,590
things together they can represent

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,260
whatever you want

00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,480
we represent like different let's say

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,730
there's a big cluster that has a group

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,690
of devices inside so we're gonna put

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,030
that as a one thing and then this big

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,260
thing will have a lot of more

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,260
interesting things that we would like to

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,020
measure right and if something like I

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,360
said is but it's just gonna be red so I

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,499
don't need to know if Network 50 is good

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,619
or bad because I'm

00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:39,839
gonna get red or yellow or whatever so

00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:42,089
me as a operator someone who watches

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,179
that I've got the big picture

00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,649
straightaway and if you look here like

00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:49,409
where is the problem like where's the

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:52,159
biggest problem well I can see that this

00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:55,379
piece looks unhealthy right like

00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,739
sometimes I can see some different types

00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,459
of failure but the the 8:37 whatever

00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,609
that is

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:07,619
looks very unhealthy across the board so

00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:09,649
that's broken I also see that failover

00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:13,259
which is a service shared between

00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:14,819
components is also broken so now we have

00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,119
a different we have horizontal and

00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:19,919
vertical failures so I can see well the

00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:21,809
whole service in this cluster is broken

00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,659
or maybe the whole cluster is broken

00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:27,889
right so different type of failures and

00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,919
you get visual correlation straight away

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:34,579
this looks more real to what our s

00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,769
arrays are looking at this looks

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:40,049
previously you saw a lot of green but if

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,239
I'm responding to things that are broken

00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:44,369
I don't care about things that are okay

00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,079
right I just I can just discard them if

00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,079
they're okay don't show me so I'm only

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,589
showing here at things that are failing

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,079
and that means that the previous screen

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,509
this could have ten pages right it's so

00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,689
many checks so many clusters where I

00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,189
just show the things are failing

00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:04,980
everything condensed to a small view a

00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:07,139
lot of times this is almost empty and

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,019
that's good right because nothing is

00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:12,119
broken we don't have to do anything and

00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,730
if it's broken I kind of know exactly

00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:19,110
what what that is so it's very easy to

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:23,069
see that this is a similar example of

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:25,139
this visual correlation you know when I

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,059
was just looking at the layers I

00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:29,730
couldn't figure out but here I see okay

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:33,899
I need any 24 is a problem everything is

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,940
broken so we just did that we gave this

00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:41,309
visual coloration to our sres

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:43,320
right and the life was good the whole

00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,990
problem of looking at all of the graphs

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,369
everything else solved right you just

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,970
look at the small thing shows you

00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:52,409
goodbye

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:54,450
and then you react this is our data

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:57,980
model and it's a lot of things on this

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:01,200
slide or we don't have time 20 minutes I

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,929
might explain just on a very high level

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,570
it's important from a perspective that a

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,759
lot of monitoring systems there they're

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,909
based on time series data and we have a

00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:14,610
different different model here so we

00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:17,299
have hierarchy we have a3 model that

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,289
means you can build in those

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,690
correlations that I was talking about

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,370
into you can build that knowledge into a

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,870
tool you can say that you know something

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,850
something is interesting and we call it

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,120
a subject so whatever is interesting

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:36,210
we're gonna call it a subject let's say

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,600
it is a house right we want to monitor a

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,700
lot of houses each subject will have

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,940
different aspects to it right a house

00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,940
you might want to monitor in a house

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:50,730
maybe electricity usage maybe you want

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,850
to see if the windows are open or closed

00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,139
the lights are on or not so you have

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,850
different things you want to measure

00:18:55,139 --> 00:19:00,750
about the house so those will be called

00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:03,419
aspects and the last thing is a sample

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:07,200
and a sample is something that says here

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:10,409
is the value of an aspect and this value

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,090
belongs to this subject so for example

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:17,460
the value of windows is closed and those

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,519
windows belong to the house three four

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,320
and that's it that's the sample it shows

00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,590
what's broken and it belongs to which

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,620
subject but now there is this hierarchy

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:31,350
that says well the house 34 is really

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,330
belongs to you know a neighborhood a and

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,950
the neighborhood a is part of something

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,350
else and then you can build that

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,870
knowledge into into your data data model

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,210
so then when someone says hey what's

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,159
going on in Chicago they can just look

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:49,039
at all the houses that are under the

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:52,950
Chicago subject so that's our data model

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,070
and by the way we focus has that model

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,440
and you're pushing data and structuring

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,500
your data in that model so this way we

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,900
can we can have that correlation

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,940
those are a couple of use cases for

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,530
refocus and you might be confused why

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,300
I'm showing you different things here

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,540
previously it was just a couple of boxes

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:15,000
yellow green but now it's kind of

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,540
different I'm going to explain this in a

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,210
minute

00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,180
but we support in the spirit of being

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,820
very configurable and super adaptable to

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,790
the environments we also have different

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,080
visualizations that we support I as a

00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,990
developer I can write my own

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,850
visualization for my own data that

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,870
visualizes the data in the best way

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:39,150
possible so for example I can model the

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,390
process you can see that this just

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,430
doesn't work the first

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:49,710
well that's very slow okay so the first

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:51,360
image is a is a model of a process it's

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,370
very small so imagine it's a sales

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,170
pipeline right we all know the sales

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,570
pipeline where you put your customers

00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,240
through and it's a different different

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,610
stages right so I can I would like to

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,140
know that in which stage is this

00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,990
customer right I can see it's a third

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,880
stage it's probably very early but the

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,920
the last one is almost it's almost

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,470
giving us money right so it's it's a

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,080
right one me as a let's say someone who

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,060
deals with money thinks I'm gonna reach

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,140
out to that customer very quickly so you

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:24,150
can see that model it's visualized and

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,700
you can see everyone who is in which

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,550
which stage of it and the similar use

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,640
case to take just an overview or a

00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,520
reporting so you could condense all of

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,830
these boxes that you saw before into one

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,870
box and say you know 30 percent is okay

00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,970
or 30 percent is wrong maybe hundred

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,610
percent so someone like an X that can

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,010
take a look and previously I was showing

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,750
high level this is very very high level

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,060
this is something for xx right they can

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,610
see a 100 percent is okay here is like

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,700
50 percent or maybe zero okay zero I'm

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,130
gonna ask why wait zero so you can you

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,140
can pick your abstraction level but you

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,480
can really abstract things away and

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,720
provide like super high level view if

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,930
you need to so let's talk about lenses

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,510
lenses are different visualizations of

00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,730
of the data because we have a dot

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,240
standard model we could build that

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,190
feature

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,670
where you can you can change the way you

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,040
show your data so this is our the one

00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:26,490
that the view we call it s or grade

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,230
RS Ari's it sells for to use that but

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,860
you can also build something like that

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,290
where maybe for your data geography

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,059
matters maybe you want to see what's

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,920
broken in Europe maybe you're a data

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,470
center engineer and you just care about

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,929
your own data data center so you kind of

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,820
visualize different gos and then maybe

00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:48,450
you can add boxes or however you want to

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,490
visualize your data you could do that or

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,260
maybe you could something like that

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,900
works better it's a kind of tree

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,450
structure with statuses you could do

00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,429
that too or maybe you want to do

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,740
something like this which really pulls

00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:04,710
that hierarchy as the first thing you

00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,020
shell to people let's say we use by the

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:09,600
way at Salesforce we use this visual for

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,330
org chart so you can see now here's the

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,070
CEO is all his directory parts and then

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,670
it goes on and on with all the people in

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,929
the team so if really that hierarchy is

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,050
the thing you want to show you would

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,970
like to use this kind of view and once

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,370
you have the data in refocus you can

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,960
keep swapping those views whatever works

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,370
for your use case just different you

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,360
send different links to people and they

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:35,370
see a different picture of your data so

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,240
that's all configurable we provide

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:42,080
tooling for developers to do that and

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,660
I'll talk about that in the mid in a bit

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:51,000
cool let's go to a demo because the demo

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:55,320
are the best if they work so what I'm

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,900
gonna do is I'm going to use a one of

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,809
the the libraries we provide for

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,870
developers it's called LD LD key which

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,429
is lens development kit and what it does

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,670
it simulates that environment it

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:15,179
simulates that refocus environment show

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:18,570
some data and and we can play with it so

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:22,260
I'm going to run the data generation

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:24,300
script if you can't see that don't worry

00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,669
there's nothing fancy here it's just I'm

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,110
just calling a script so that script

00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:30,110
will generate some data for me

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,790
so this is what our sree sree sree this

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,760
is the SR great and you can see I'm

00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:42,060
monitoring the the state of the Shire I

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,640
want to see Hobby houses and see how

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,250
they how they perform if that's the

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,240
correct thing to look at so I'm looking

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:53,220
at you know if the alarm is working is

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,170
do they have battery health actually

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,250
that's not the right let's just look at

00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:01,980
the simple one first so the the hobbits

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,870
in north farting they have have a very

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,660
simple houses so they will have only

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:10,410
alarms Carbone detectors

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:14,460
maybe some CCTV and rings smoke

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,770
detectors temperature so I can take a

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,810
look at this and see you know everything

00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,720
is okay maybe if I'm a hobbit

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,250
responsible for responding to issues at

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,380
Hobby houses I'm kind of monitoring

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,380
their houses I can just take a look at

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,710
what's broken and figure out what to do

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,200
about it so if this house has a really

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:38,010
low battery health I may want to reach

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,570
out right it is alarm and you know that

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,940
there is like a hobbit crew that fixes

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:49,110
alarm so I can call them and then they

00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:51,450
will go and fix it so again this what I

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,760
just did with this hiding is I just hide

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,790
that the the whole thing here so you can

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,370
see so many pages of Hobbit houses

00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,370
they're very very popular they like

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,590
building houses so a lot of them are

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:09,870
here if I look at the failures this is

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:12,600
very easy to comprehend so imagine you

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:17,340
wanted to show a different view so I'm

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,580
going to do that to spot a couple of

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,580
things

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,040
again I'm running a different script

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,490
that generated the same data and

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:34,250
installed a different different view so

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,170
if the geography is important I can see

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,690
that everything belongs to the

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,460
middle-earth right there's nothing else

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,290
there maybe there is different words out

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,570
there but Hobbit they don't know about

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,920
them if there was different words I

00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,630
could just add them to refocus they

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,490
would be it would be here but everything

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,960
is as far as we are concerned everything

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,530
is in middle-earth then we have the

00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:00,290
Shire that have Hobbit houses there is a

00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:02,900
tag that tell us the Hobbit the Shire is

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,260
split into those things right so I can

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,900
see it's a Buckland it's a north farting

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,270
but when I look at here I can see a tag

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,540
that shows me a smart Hobbit smart

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:16,190
hobbit houses and this one shows just

00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,760
Hobbit houses so there's something

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:22,100
different so then when I look at the the

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,220
house in a smart hub it houses word I

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:29,450
can see those metrics let me check the

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:33,460
the system this is a standard this is

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:40,310
too big to show that's a start

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:42,560
smart okay it's not gonna be very good

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,650
but you can see there is more services

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,110
in this and less service in the services

00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,300
in that so for me as an operator as a

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,880
hobbit who monitors houses

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,520
I don't care those are two different

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,060
types of homes right if if you have like

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,770
old house you might have you know a

00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,500
hobbit house de system that monitors

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,480
that cysts that house and it works but

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,580
if some hobbits there are super

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,200
conscious about sustainability they

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,560
wanted to go for smart home that

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,630
measures their usage of energy they have

00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,180
solar panels and all of that cool things

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,920
they need a different system to monitor

00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,810
that right it's a super advanced

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,870
technology so they've installed

00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:25,700
something different to collect the data

00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,730
but for me the The Hobbit who monitors

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,790
everything I just see you know what's

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,260
the status is this okay is this broken

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,890
so this shows you in a very very

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,140
small and simple example how you know it

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:42,010
abstracts so much complexity for a

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,180
person who is responding to those issues

00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,890
imagine you know we're just talking

00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,910
about two different things in technology

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,410
we have hundreds of things every day and

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,970
multiplies this by by some scale that

00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:58,340
you are at and it's getting really

00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,830
complex very quickly right so we have 15

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:04,880
minutes left that's good that means I

00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,580
can show you my baby my coolest feature

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,780
of this project that we recently added

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,620
and we are in the middle of open

00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:17,690
sourcing right now so we're going to

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,490
talk about rooms and BOTS now so this

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,250
this is a natural progression of the

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,160
workflow when something is broken in

00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,880
your refocus something is red like what

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,400
do you do next

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,190
right when alarm detector is broken in

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,410
some hobbit house what do you do well

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,150
you might want to find someone first of

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,610
all you need a new part right you need a

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,980
new alarm that works how do you get a

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,540
new alarm well you have to order it from

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,820
somewhere maybe you call them maybe

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,530
there's an API call maybe there is a

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,510
website where you are there those new

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,090
things so that's first thing get a new

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,370
part

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,590
someone has to replace it I couldn't do

00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,950
it I have two left hands but even if I

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,270
could do it you know fixing your alarm

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,830
might not be something you want to do it

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,880
yourself so you might want to call some

00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:07,000
hobbit group that specializes in alarms

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,370
so I just had to do two different things

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,850
start two different workflows in

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:16,550
response to that red thing on refocus so

00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,720
I had to make some actions and this is

00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:25,550
what the refocus rooms and bots are

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:28,310
created for so but our things are doing

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,440
things for us so for example in the in

00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,700
that case where we had to order a new

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,980
alarm a bot would be going to a vendor

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,200
ordering something from the website and

00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,180
coming back to us and says yes you have

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,020
it ordered wait you know one day and

00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:47,120
you're going to get it there is a piece

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,540
where we have everything we have the

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,980
Kru hobbit crew we have the alarm and

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,860
now we have the kind of cord and we say

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,320
you know take this go to this house and

00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,740
report back so this is what we call a

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,890
room this is where people in BOTS gather

00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:08,150
together to collaborate on that response

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:10,700
today to the event so if in the context

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:14,300
of software maybe we can leave the

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:17,570
hobbits alone that's going to be you

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,540
know things are broken very broken

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:23,000
nobody knows what's going on right and

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,920
so maybe but we look at that Network and

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,570
the network is a little bit slow so then

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,290
I'm gonna call a network team and say

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:33,170
hey can you join my call and help us to

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,870
figure out what's going on so they join

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,309
right then they say nothing is wrong

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,220
with the network so you're gonna say

00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:42,440
well this service looks unhealthy let me

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,110
call the service only for that

00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,059
particular functionality you call them

00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,559
and now you have 10 people and I call

00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,330
and then you have 20 people in they call

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,059
and it keeps going right so at some

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,309
point you have your insulin response

00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:58,400
that means a lot of people gather and

00:31:55,309 --> 00:31:59,870
collaborate and if you did all of that

00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,190
on a conference call

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,140
you're gonna have a lot of people

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:08,990
talking so that's hard ready

00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:12,290
they say you can control a call up to

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,640
six or eight people after that doesn't

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,980
matter how skilled you are you're gonna

00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,040
lose control of a call there's just too

00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,350
many people so that's one challenge the

00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,780
other challenge is when I'm responding

00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,780
to the big event that thing that you

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,820
know the Shire is on fire or my sir my

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,490
sales force doesn't work right the whole

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:35,240
company is down that's a big event so

00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:37,309
for me when I handle those events I have

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,800
to do something every there's a protocol

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:41,330
for that right so maybe when the if the

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,170
service doesn't work I need to tell the

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,610
whole company hey we're we're down if

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,870
you can help here's the brief

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:50,150
description of the problem if you think

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,610
you can help us join the call and help

00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,310
us maybe I have to tell my customers

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:58,010
that we're done right that's how you

00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,720
build trust so I might want to send a

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,310
notification through like separate

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,130
system maybe some status

00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,810
that shows tells our customers that

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,880
we're down so there is things that I

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,450
have to do during those very important

00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,070
responses and if I'm under pressure if I

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,990
have 40 people in a call everybody

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,630
screaming I'm gonna forget about it

00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:20,090
right I'm just a human so having a

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,430
system that allows you to first of all

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,700
do the things that you have to do and

00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,350
second of all tell you you know at this

00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,140
point of time during an incident you

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,490
should this sub blah right or add the

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,520
other time you should do something else

00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:38,350
it's really helpful so we abstracted the

00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:41,870
incident management response into

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,820
creating rooms and BOTS so we gather in

00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,970
a room where we have a bunch of bots

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,890
that are doing work for us and also we

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:52,490
can collaborate we are meaning humans

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:54,410
and other hobbits right so like I said

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,540
we are in the middle of open sourcing

00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,060
this now so I don't have a cool slides

00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,340
that are approved and all of that I can

00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:04,040
show you a demo and I can show you a

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,800
demo how this looks like on a real kind

00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,790
of incident real real situations when we

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,820
are under pressure

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:18,860
something went from really red to a big

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:23,000
big problem so that's how a room will

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:26,000
look like and that's a slide so a room

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,190
looks like you get one page and you get

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,550
status updates from a lot of BOTS and

00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,560
and it will go into into an example

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,650
maybe that's gonna be better so just

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:42,080
show the demo so that's one of the rooms

00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:45,050
something was broken and now what do you

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,300
have to do like for for us at Salesforce

00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,520
we have to have like a case like we have

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,650
to log it in some sort of system of

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,210
record that this happened at that point

00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:58,490
of time so here is that here's our case

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,220
and cases will have information about

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:05,240
you know the ID the subject of the

00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:08,270
problem description status and the

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,310
impact like which piece of our clusters

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,280
are impacted so we're going to use the

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,300
this case and under the hood this is a

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,490
bot

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,290
this is a bot that knows that you want

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,970
to know the style let's say those fails

00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,070
you know the subject description and

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,960
behind the scenes it goes to some

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,610
back-end system and it creates that case

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,670
and it gives you that information back

00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:31,400
in our case we use we use Salesforce to

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,470
manage all of our infrastructure so it

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,450
will go to Salesforce platform create a

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:39,590
case and show us like what's going on

00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,900
there so that's our case but in the

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,300
middle you see a timeline bot so

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,150
timeline is something where I can

00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,880
provide my update let's say I've done

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:53,420
something for our hobbits and I've

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,600
ordered some alarm for them so I'm gonna

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,910
say my update one is is blah right so I

00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,210
can say this here in a room it looks

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:05,210
like a chat and and people see like what

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:08,360
happened when and we have a nice log of

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,570
of what happens if you drill down here

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,850
to events there is things that we're

00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:17,170
capturing automatically so whatever

00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:20,300
happens on this page people use a bot to

00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:23,330
order an alarm or they use some bot to

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,620
post a status update and we're gonna log

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,990
it automatically so you don't have to

00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,060
worry about because what was very

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:32,450
important after the incident when you do

00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,970
a post mortem or RCA or however you call

00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,650
the root cause analysis is actually

00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,150
knowing what happened and when during a

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,510
rain stand what kind of decisions were

00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,540
made at which point of time and how they

00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:46,280
impacted the resolution and so we're

00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,250
catching all of these events we catch

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,650
users info as well so who joined this

00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,210
room who left right so you get a lot of

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,990
information out of out of this

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,510
particular bot on the right hand side we

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:02,870
have communications bots so one of the

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,400
protocol itself for this to send an

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,100
update every half an hour to the whole

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,930
company send an update to all of our

00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,060
customers every half an hour and I have

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,640
to do it every half an hour so there's

00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,150
no no other excuse this is our SLA we

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,710
provide timely updates during incidents

00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,590
so I'm going to use these communications

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,210
but to to define that to tell me okay

00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:27,350
here's the cadence for this particular

00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:28,160
update we call it TC and when once I do

00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,109
it once

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,380
then that TC is going to start the timer

00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:35,990
and is going to remind me you know five

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,700
minutes to the next ec 4 minutes and so

00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,819
on so on so I don't have to think about

00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,710
that task which is something that you

00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:45,470
have to remember and it's high pressure

00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,660
environment again so this is this is

00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,089
really helpful maybe there is some

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,549
things you always do every incident so

00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:54,799
you know 10 minutes in you have to check

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:56,450
if you have a backup option 20 minutes

00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:58,760
in you have to tell your all of our

00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,440
exits all of those things that they are

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,039
around your incident response you can

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,220
just put them there here are the timers

00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:11,539
tasks and use the communications both to

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:14,059
manage that the drop zone bot is is for

00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:17,420
pictures if I look at the lock I see I

00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:19,789
see some graphs I would rather have that

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,170
graph in the system then try me trying

00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:23,180
to kind of explain what's on the graph

00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:27,559
right like one picture tells us way more

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:31,460
than a lot of words so I will use drop

00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:33,799
zone to upload pictures there is also a

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,140
participant spot which helped us to

00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:39,289
assign different roles during incidents

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,609
so someone there's always one person

00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:43,069
running the show there's always an

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,500
incident commander who basically runs

00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:48,140
the conference call and makes decisions

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,089
on the call there is someone who is a

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,160
communications owner someone who is

00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,839
responsible for making sure that company

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,079
knows what's going on and our customers

00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,020
know what's going on there is someone

00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,180
who catches the data like documentation

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,220
owner make sure that we document

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,789
everything that's happening for the for

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,859
the analysis afterwards and something

00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:11,750
like troubleshooting and dynamic data

00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:13,339
mining someone has a very specific role

00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,140
to just do troubleshooting all the time

00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,420
don't get distracted with anything else

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,859
all this communication is everything

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,779
else is not important you just do

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,160
troubleshooting so you can assign those

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:24,109
different roles to people during an

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,819
incident and it becomes really handy

00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,440
when you have 40 people on the call and

00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,390
you have to say okay you're responsible

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,549
for that the other person is responsible

00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,079
for something else it's very clear very

00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:36,740
transparent like who is doing what and

00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:41,869
when so that's our participants about

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:42,140
and the last one is on call so this this

00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,470
is

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:48,049
pay to do the integration and if I need

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:50,239
if I have a problem with network and

00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:53,480
application and I don't know I'm just

00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,130
gonna look for network and you know

00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,839
Salesforce is big so we have a bunch of

00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,960
network teams but let's say I just

00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:02,420
called this network team and I also own

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,799
some application people maybe

00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,769
performance application right so I click

00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:11,779
just page and what it does it says

00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:14,480
here's that room where people are

00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:16,460
collaborating and we we need your help

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,710
so please go to this room and help us

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,049
it's very simple and everybody knows

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,539
where to go previously we had a

00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:26,380
conference call and a bunch of our C

00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:29,059
channels or different whichever

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,559
communication tool you use and people

00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,900
gather you know they will be scattered

00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,329
through like emails different services

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,749
and the chat will happen everywhere

00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:40,430
but with room we say for the incident

00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:42,829
there is one room and you join this and

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,210
let's talk here so I can click page and

00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:45,980
they're gonna join I'm gonna get the

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,440
feedback from pager Duty that they've

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:56,599
received the alert and they they've

00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:59,269
joined right so again rooms and BOTS are

00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:03,410
a concept that we created and it's a

00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:05,779
very generalized way to say maybe from a

00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,239
different angle we've used incident

00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:09,349
management and then we abstracted what

00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,390
you do during the incidents at

00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:12,890
Salesforce to something that you can do

00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,839
any kind of event response

00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,999
I can imagine Police Department fire

00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,609
department just building their own BOTS

00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:21,440
to do what they do and creating that

00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,420
room with those BOTS and collaborating

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,400
together so if you have this kind of use

00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,289
case where you have a bunch of people

00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,599
that need to collaborate and there is

00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:31,450
some things you have to do maybe talk to

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,980
a lot of different external services

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:38,059
this sounds like like that this

00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:41,900
functionality so just to wrap it up from

00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:44,859
visibility to actions and that's that's

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,809
that's what we do currently with refocus

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:49,999
there's one more cool feature I have no

00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:52,999
time to talk about with the collectors

00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:55,520
and we started with push model we said

00:41:52,999 --> 00:42:00,380
we're gonna take your data just give

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,180
to us so they gave it to us but they

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,460
people wrote a lot of scripts and they

00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,080
were not really reliable and so at some

00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,270
point we said well our customers have

00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,010
reliability issues with getting data to

00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:13,010
refocus so we build a framework for

00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,910
collectors and we provide collecting

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:23,150
service for four teams that's a very

00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:26,090
high level description cool right I

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:29,060
always forget to say that we're open

00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,040
sourced if you go to Salesforce github

00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,410
at councils for free focus that's our

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,870
repo and if you just search in

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,780
Salesforce repose for refocus you will

00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:40,550
see a bunch of smaller repos and we

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,620
provide a lot of tooling for developers

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,720
so if you want to write your own but

00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,340
you'll have to link for that if you want

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,890
to build your own lens you'll have

00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,710
tooling for that and you'll have example

00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:54,470
lenses example bots that we're in the

00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:57,230
middle of open sourcing there's a blog

00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,690
post if you like to read you don't want

00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:02,900
to listen to the boring talk so you can

00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,760
just read about it and yeah it's free

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:15,020
you can take it use it at your company

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:17,810
and we're happy to share right okay one

00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,910
minute was right on time I think we have

00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:24,710
a little bit time for some short

00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:27,710
questions maybe hi

00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:31,550
I would like to know how do you notify

00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:35,810
colleagues or people that's is something

00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:38,510
going on in this room may I mean they

00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,610
they will not always be in the right

00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,820
room at the right time Raoh

00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:45,260
so if they're those are people who are

00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,060
supposed to help you to solve the

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,700
problem I'm gonna page them I'm gonna

00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,500
use the on call bots to page them on

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,990
their phones so they're gonna get an SMS

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,300
or whatever they'd like to get and you

00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,310
can configure that so if you're

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,070
responsible for a service you're gonna

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:03,830
get a page and you have to join so

00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:05,540
that's how we get to know and there is

00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,250
also protocol but all of the things I'm

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,050
talking about is the implementation that

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:12,200
we've done in Salesforce so

00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,940
Roncalli we use pager duty for the whole

00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,160
company to know that there is some

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,570
problem we send a regular update every

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,970
half an hour to the whole company and

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:23,890
says say you know here is the problem

00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,890
here's the room where we try to figure a

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:30,770
lot of different mediums

00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:33,320
well email and we're Salesforce to run

00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:36,020
Salesforce so there is a feature called

00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,300
chatter and chatter is like almost like

00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,220
Facebook but it's now I don't be on the

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,990
record saying that you can collaborate

00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,770
with people using chatter right you can

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:48,080
say at someone do something so we use

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,210
that too for for letting know like the a

00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,520
lot of mediums like the the more the

00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,840
better because we we really want to the

00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,490
whole company to know if something is

00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,620
really broken to kind of get on board

00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:03,020
quickly help us and to figure out yeah

00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,820
alright so commute will be around if you

00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,470
have any other questions one more time

00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,120
thank you very much for being here thank
