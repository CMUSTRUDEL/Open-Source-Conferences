Title: OSMC 2018 | Netzwerkmonitoring mit Prometheus by Matthias Gallinger
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Prometheus and Grafana referred to a dynamic duo and are currently talk of the town. But the questions that begs to be answered are :

* How can metrics be collected and processed via SNMP?
* How could Grafana visualize tons of network ports in a simple way?
* Is there a way to collect ad hoc metrics for troubleshooting?

In my talk, I try and address these questions and at the same time I will talk about the requirements and pitfalls of implementing the SNMP Exporter for Prometheus using OMD in big network environment for a global corporation.
