Title: OSMC 2018 | Building a healthy on-call culture by Serhat Can
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Paging people just creates series of problems unless you put enough resources to build a healthy “on-call” culture. Nobody wants to be buried into alerts or wake up at 2 am in the morning.

There are several points you have to take into account to make on-call suck less. At the center of each of these items, there are people. If you put your people at the center and design your incident response thinking about them in the first place, on-call becomes a competitive advantage.

In this presentation, Serhat will start defining on-call and why we need a robust on-call culture. At this point, he’ll mention the impact of downtime and performance degradation such as direct revenue, and credibility losses. Then, continue listing 6 must-haves: – Be transparent – Share responsibilities – Get ready for wartime – Build resilient and sustainable systems – Create actionable alerts – Learn from your experiences In each of these steps, there will be crucial points and pieces of advice to both developers and management systems. In the end, Serhat will show that our efforts in building a better on-call culture, will pay off as our people and user’s happiness.03

[Music]

00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:22,140
hi everyone welcome to my talk again my

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,840
name is Sarah John yes it happens all

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,609
the time so it's okay so I work at

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,580
obscene E and now Atlassian is

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,410
reacquired just a month ago so we're not

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,899
open source but we do integrate it I

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,030
mean it was like sensitizing no Griffin

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,290
I promise you sir you're going to see

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,010
today

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,780
so I also join DevOps ice core team just

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,030
a while ago so I'm helping them of

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,289
stations all around the world with

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,640
burned and Chris here today so we are

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,670
going to talk about building a how-to on

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,140
call culture is relevant to what we do

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,640
at optionee but you know has nothing to

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,520
do with my talk is nothing to do it off

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,969
shinny let's just start and right into

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,220
topic so what is on call DT I'm sure

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,430
like how many people like has been on

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,860
called here

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:13,439
okay half more than half so it's still

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,570
like I can mention what song called it

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,430
so uncle basically means that you need

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,400
to be available for work during an

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,110
emergency during a problem basically

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,210
like if if there's a problem with your

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,140
service you're going to get a get a get

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,909
an alert and you need to work on this so

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,540
there so I tried to find something

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,570
scientific around like the like why

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,420
uncle can be challenging and this is

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,450
what I come up with so I actually like

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,490
it was a surprise so a John Young that

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,920
Mars from Hamburg University here in

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,310
Germany but they did a study they did a

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,170
day right they wrote a paper called on

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,170
the psychological toll of being on call

00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:01,250
duty and what they found basically did

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:04,920
the the thing was so they had 133 at

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,899
participants and those parts spoons were

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,849
on call for four days including weekdays

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,220
and what they found that even if they

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,620
don't get also fathers and they still

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,599
see some signs of stress

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,690
they made them chew gums and you know

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,530
included just to measure the cortisol

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,120
level and did some questionnaires and

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,560
basically what they found is that even

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,420
if they don't get a lot of fathers it's

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,420
still a stressful job and it shows even

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,030
after after later later later on call so

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,760
it's the stressful jobs no matter what

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,049
you do that is what we accept but

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,900
straights on the other hand can be a

00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,959
good thing Robert Sapolsky I recommend

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,720
you to watch this talk it's a short talk

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,670
like form in stocks and he talks about a

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,220
white stress can be useful when it's the

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,140
right amount of stress and he gives the

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,180
example of it's not for nothing that you

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,250
don't have rollercoasters running for

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,370
three weeks right because it's gonna be

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,510
stressful so stress should be is good if

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,730
it's transient and if it's in a context

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,549
that overall feels safe so that is what

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,680
we try to write what we should try to

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,230
achieve when we try to build an on-call

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,489
team on call culture in our company but

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,620
the problem is no matter what you do

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,000
most people hate on call but there's a

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,769
good reason again it's mostly about

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,930
stress and made most about use of

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,639
salutes no matter what you do like

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,950
you're gonna get paged and called like

00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,950
in the middle of tonight it is what we

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:34,319
are going to try to dig into to get

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,849
together today so but why do we put

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,769
people on call because we have every

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:39,419
increasing demands around availability

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,310
and reliability of our applications and

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,930
the first reason is of course all of

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,489
them are economic reasons of course but

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,680
the first one is directly rainy lost and

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,599
there is no research done by the

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,060
phenomen Institute Emerson Network power

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,810
what they found is that a data center

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,849
out which costed around $800 per minute

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,569
so this might not be relevant in your

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:03,840
area of expertise but there are still

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,209
other research basically showing how how

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,150
it can be impactful for your company

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,519
especially from the cost perspective so

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,739
we try that is why we put people on call

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,430
we need always-on services it is the

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,889
reason and there is this impact of an

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,690
on-call culture and basically the

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,450
reasons are the same because if it's

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,130
on-call culture basically is bad and is

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,200
not held healthy

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,990
and then people start not caring about

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,990
others basically downtime suffers at the

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:38,880
end and also employees suffer as you

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,710
know like our most precious like our our

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,020
value it comes from our employees so we

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,460
need to take care of them that is one of

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,950
the best like the important things in IT

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:53,040
so we don't give up we try we should try

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:57,630
our best to make on-call better less

00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:03,480
stressful and so I'm going to talk about

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:05,580
six different titles and under those

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,400
sites I will give some examples and this

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,740
will be hopefully help you learn like

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,840
some of the basic stuffs that you need

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,330
to think about when you are doing like

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,310
doing on calling your company which

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,730
starts with being transparent so

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,900
transparency is also important for your

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,300
company overall but it's also very

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,060
important phone call so if you are

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,120
hiring someone new what you need to do

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,190
is you need to talk about on call before

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,310
you don't make this price for especially

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,980
anyone you are hiring new so it doesn't

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,170
matter like nowadays in IT even if you

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,420
are not a developer operations folks use

00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,720
you you might get on call as well so

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,400
it's just becoming a common thing so

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,780
basically you need to talk about on call

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,490
before hiring and if you are making a

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,140
change in your company you also need to

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,720
talk about your employees before you

00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,760
basically make that change and it is

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,860
okay that sometimes people don't want to

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,070
be on call some people just don't feel

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,310
comfortable and then you might want to

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:10,200
just find the middle or maybe just don't

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:13,200
hire that person there is okay - and the

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,060
second thing you need to do is to set

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,490
responsibilities or phone call in a

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,630
clear way so you expect on call to carry

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,870
their you know mobile phones laptops

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,760
that is of course the priority and that

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,890
you if you are putting someone on call

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,180
we are going to page them so you expect

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,410
that you need to be clear on things like

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,390
this and in major incidents so the major

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,979
instance require different approach so

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,630
you have different roles like incident

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,310
commander subject matter experts you

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,440
know scribe

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,540
that can track everything or

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,340
communications manager so you need to

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,710
clearly define what those roles are and

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,960
like you need to be you need to be

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,580
certain about like who is responsible

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,220
for what and make sure that everyone

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,260
knows is like his or her job it doing

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,960
those high-level high-impact incidents

00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,410
and you need to be I really like to

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,630
submit to it from Cindy this is actually

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,950
what we have found in optioning so you

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,370
need to be clear unavailable to have

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:11,040
employees what I mean by that is that

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,720
most companies don't expect on-call

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,790
engineers to do any future development

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,310
so at first we try to like this divided

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,620
into two like an on-call engineer can

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,710
actually spend for example 40 hours at a

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,420
week two and hours a week in future

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,100
development but that didn't really work

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,200
for us because it was unexpected

00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,910
sometimes they had a lot of time

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,690
sometimes basically they worked on

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,840
others all the time

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:39,480
so what we come up with is similar to

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,490
this one but we expect uncle engineer to

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,740
work on improving other thing and

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,990
monitoring our dashboards basically

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:51,180
making the system our system more

00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,500
resilient that of shiney so the second

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,920
one in our list is sharing

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,240
responsibilities in traditional IT

00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,390
environments as you know we have

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,300
operations teams an Operations teams

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,190
take on call that is one of their main

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,380
responsibilities but it puts so much

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,420
pressure on those teams and especially

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,280
if you are going to use some sort of

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,960
like micro service architecture it makes

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,540
it a lot harder to scale if you have

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,530
only one team blue on-call and there are

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,630
other problems as our we're going to

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,400
talk about this so you should start

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,380
creating fair schedules what I mean by

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,300
fair schedule is that you need to avoid

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,120
inappropriate operational load and on

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,820
the road for example when we talk about

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,220
operational load for example if someone

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,770
is on call for like for a month that is

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,640
obviously not a good like operation load

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:40,470
but if you only put like one person like

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,390
say a day in every three months there is

00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,850
also not good because then that person

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,530
will have lack of practical knowledge

00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,450
don't know what to do during incidents

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,600
that will be also stressful and will

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,510
affect your uptime

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,340
and one thing you can do if you're a big

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,950
company I know that there are also big

00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,340
companies in Germany so you can try to

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,610
do follow the Sun schedule what I mean

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,050
is that you if you have team members in

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,130
different time zones you can try to

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,200
adjust your own call schedule may try to

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,270
put them on call during their business

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,130
hours that is obviously the best case it

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,990
helps reduce the stress a lot but that

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:23,000
is only possible if you have a big huge

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,430
company and the next one is analysis

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,530
putting developers on call so as you

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,680
know this is becoming more and more

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,200
common especially companies like Amazon

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,480
talking about this a lot probably heard

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,180
about this term you will time you run it

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,820
we follow its similar approaches of

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,560
 we basically combine what Google

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,440
does and Amazon does we have a necessary

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,330
team but we also put on developers on

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
call for every everything they created

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:55,910
there are some benefits to this so the

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,580
first one is developers so we have every

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,050
rising like expectations we have rising

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,510
expectations around availability

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,670
reliability of our explication security

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,860
of our applications and developers are

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,740
often the best people who can solve

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,260
these problems and when obviously this

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,030
increases uptime and when you put

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,380
developers phone call it helps also a

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,720
better alignment of developers and

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,370
development and operations what I mean

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,810
by this is if they experience the

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,840
problems in the first and if they get

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,490
the others themselves they start caring

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,280
about things like testing monitoring

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,050
alerting we've seen this with with no

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,030
option as well we at the beginning when

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,400
we were small the late night shifts were

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,720
on the co-founders so they were

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,300
basically knowing I do not know

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,800
everything probably using cases like

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,410
this and at some point

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,960
alerts like start increasing and then we

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,210
when we included more developers into

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:50,690
night night shifts and then we see a lot

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:54,320
of improvements and also the last thing

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,540
is we also see better alignment of

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,490
development and management what timing

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:04,170
is by this is that if management sees

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,360
the time spans the developers span

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,730
spending time on these operational

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,680
concerns than they can estimate that how

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,350
much time they need to spend on creating

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:18,209
more resilient systems it helps them

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,459
adjust their priorities and you need to

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,220
have clear paths of paths for escalation

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,139
so if there's a problem engineers should

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,850
be able to easily escalate to the next

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,480
person or bring an another team member

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,550
and it should be it shouldn't be like

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,920
should I do it basically if it's like if

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,660
it's not a certain case basically

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,680
bringing some more people and try to fix

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:45,480
it quickly and hopefully this should be

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:48,089
written and easy to escape so the next

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,199
one is a bit generic but you need to get

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:52,260
prepared you need to get ready for

00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:55,529
wartime you need to plan ahead and this

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,329
starts with onboarding and training so

00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:59,370
you need to onboard new engineers and

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:02,639
you need to explain the basics and set

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,910
up notification rules for them basically

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,720
if you if it's better if you let them

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:11,490
let give them flexibility to configure

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,529
their notification rules by themselves

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,480
that will be is easy and better for them

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,579
and you need to give access to the right

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,500
tools and what I recommend is that you

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,630
need to use shadow Inc that is actually

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,449
a great way to you know on board any

00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,190
on-call engineer so shadowing is you put

00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:28,260
an on-call engineer at the same time

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,550
with the same your engineer not saying

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,100
arranging maybe someone experienced this

00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,230
day so basically if there's an alert

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,079
they are both paged there they get up at

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,790
the same time be or during doing day

00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,060
they start working on this yet at the

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:43,980
same time so they learn so basically new

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,829
bone collagen you learn from the

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:51,120
experience one this is actually very

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:54,060
common and I think like this is this

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,360
should be a must very useful way of

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,940
onboarding new engineers and you need to

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,459
do some training there are things like

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,630
failure fright Fridays basically you

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,720
gather everything and you try to

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,730
simulate an incident response scenario

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,019
this can be very useful to reduce the

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:14,250
stress during actual incidents and

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,720
trembles probably you know what our MOOC

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,459
is so basically step by step

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,660
instructions that you can follow of

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,100
value

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,199
like you attach a ramekin to the

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,449
incident and you see like what you need

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:26,910
to check first and the next it helps you

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,470
it guides you if there's a problem if

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,990
you don't know what to do it's also very

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,999
stressful so Ramos definitely helped but

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,399
also they can get expired pretty quickly

00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:40,740
so you need to try to keep them

00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:43,230
up-to-date that can also be a problem so

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,970
fourth one is building more resilient

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,860
and sustainable systems I was talking

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,980
with Chris earlier not earlier but a

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,649
while ago Chris mentioned that the key

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,300
is just this but I believe that this is

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,449
important but this is not the only thing

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,189
that a unity care but so building

00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:00,959
resilient systems and sustainable

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:02,970
systems is very important if you want to

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,649
have and how to on call culture because

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,629
if you get a lot of others no matter

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,999
what you do if you can't keep your

00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:13,290
system up and running obviously there is

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:18,480
not much to write so in I was like this

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,980
because it's this is true right yeah so

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,629
especially if you are looking at

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,269
microservices architecture it can get

00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:29,429
pretty nasty so you need to spend more

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:34,949
time on making it more resilient and

00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:37,889
this for example then we think about

00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:39,660
things like logging metrics Mont

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:43,079
distribute racing especially

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,759
microservices and basically the concept

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,529
of this conference is about these things

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,529
and these are very important if you want

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,110
a sustainable on call culture if you

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:54,990
don't know what like how to debug your

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,610
problems basically that is the most

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,929
stressful thing that can happen is

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,509
basically you are just you know wishing

00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,309
that things go back to the steady state

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,959
and the next time it happens you don't

00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,670
know what to do again so it is very

00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,559
important and you need to set up alerts

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,139
that you can manage so if you have like

00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,639
hundred micro services you don't you

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,170
shouldn't have a lot of different

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,939
alerting parameters you need to have

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,259
common alerting parameters and use them

00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:20,129
reuse them different in different

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:23,279
services and probably using monkey right

00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:25,019
cause monkey there are it's not just

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,509
Netflix cars monkey there are now a lot

00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,130
of different tools different animals

00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,699
always animals

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,810
and you can and you should use if you

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:38,970
have like you should try to be service

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,920
level objective you use slow objectives

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,540
and especially if you have heard error

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,930
but just what I mean that you can't

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,269
spend actually you can have some time

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,130
time according to your service level

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,690
objectives you should especially use

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,310
that limit with the house engineering

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,750
things because no matter what you do

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,279
it's not going to be the same with this

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,230
production incident but if you do cows

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,860
engineering basically you're gonna see

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,410
what happens in the in the real world

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,660
and the fifth one is creating actionable

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,339
alerts what I mean by actionable is that

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,310
you know what what to do when you

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,529
receive an alert that is very important

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,819
because often we receive a lot of uses

00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,720
others that is one of the reasons on

00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:21,930
Cossacks so we try to reduce we should

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,089
try to reduce noise so we need to define

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,449
what matters to us not everything like

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:31,620
it's gonna matter if you can increase if

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:34,170
you have like increased CPU usage that

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,600
could be important or not so you need to

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,639
define those you need to try to use

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,980
service level objectives when you create

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,750
others and there's a whole like huge

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,250
section in the site's reliable sites

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,230
reliable to work book of Google I will

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:52,319
show you as the recommended book later

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:55,170
so you can use service level objectives

00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,790
to drive alerting for this matter and to

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,230
prioritize your alerts and you need to

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,970
filter out some users others I'm not

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,760
saying that you ignore those alerts

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,589
because we want to improve your alerting

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,569
but you you don't need to page for

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,600
everything at the end you can just

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,449
create a genetic --it if you don't want

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,480
to page someone for example and deal

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,309
with it later and one of the biggest

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,530
problems is you just wrote dollars to

00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,059
draw wrong people and they they get up

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,439
and they try to fix it and they don't

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,110
know like what to do and they just

00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,270
escalate to the try another team so we

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,929
should try our best to maybe automate

00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,990
this process and try to other track

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:37,830
people the right owners of the services

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,970
but this also comes like you need to you

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,520
need to have clear boundaries between

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,809
different services so that you can other

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,980
track people what

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,850
this is also one of the reasons that

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:50,309
people hate on call and also you need to

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,740
have some sort of context and this is

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:54,899
this also includes RAM box so if you

00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,029
have Ram books you have some sort of

00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:58,919
context on what to do but also what you

00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:02,610
can do is you can attach some of the

00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,070
login information some of the monitoring

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,740
information from those tools from from

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:09,539
your tools on $2 directly so this helps

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,789
during an incident this helps reduce the

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,220
context switching and also you have like

00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:20,490
a lot of information on alert that will

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:23,999
help you get started easily and six-one

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:29,009
in our list is about learning from our

00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:32,730
experiences so of course if we are like

00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:33,990
doing everything but obviously we are

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,119
gonna fail but if you are not learning

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,909
from our failures basically we fail for

00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:44,460
nothing so we need to learn from our

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:47,039
failures for our experiences this starts

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,899
with creating blame is post-mortems what

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,389
I mean by blame is is that if you point

00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:54,269
someone and if you say like this person

00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:57,240
based because this one and even Google

00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,710
Beckett today has post mortems like this

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,139
they give some examples in the side

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,210
right but the workbook so even if like

00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:05,580
you can learn from these things as well

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,259
from your post mortems as well so it

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,619
doesn't help to blame someone you need

00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:15,539
to be rational you need to you need to

00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:18,690
be blames and you need to list why this

00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,539
happened like what to do next time the

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,129
the like timeline of events you need to

00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,940
keep track of everything and share with

00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:28,019
the with your users and within your team

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,519
depending on the priority of the

00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:37,200
incident the impact of the incident and

00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:39,330
you need to think about different

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,679
metrics you need to collect it possible

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,720
you need to collect different alerts

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,399
from different probably you have

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,190
different monitoring tools logging tools

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:50,429
and you need to have some sort of Center

00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,009
like collect every alert in a like in a

00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:55,139
tool and if you can create different

00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:55,830
others and see like how many times how

00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:57,750
many hours

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,090
a person is on call has been on call for

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,830
the last let's say three months and then

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,570
you can see that you can actually

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:07,019
improve it you need to have some sort of

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:09,630
matrix also like for example acknowledge

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,460
time of the alerts close like van Landel

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:16,429
result these are also important metrics

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:20,269
you need to collect and study later and

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:22,950
I know that this is in Germany is

00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,390
probably a little bit better a little

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,840
bit better than us

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,179
but on call if possible should be paid

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,070
but there's a limit so if you pay a lot

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,809
of money then people start you know

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:39,179
might start creating unnecessary alerts

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:44,220
so it's just I need money so I need to

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:46,409
get up anymore the 2:00 a.m. and so what

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,470
what I suggest is what we do for example

00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:55,049
at of scene II so we don't pay extra for

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,210
the for the alerts but what we do is if

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,240
like a person generally is on call for

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,669
five days for us and the next week we

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,019
give like one day free like basic day

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,559
for four days the next follow-up

00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:12,659
following week there is a good incentive

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:14,820
that you can use for on-call work so we

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:17,630
talked about six things being

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,889
transparent sharing responsibilities

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,159
mostly about putting developers on call

00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:26,370
being prepared doing logging monitoring

00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,289
chaos engineering but is about building

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,409
resilient and sustainable systems and

00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,740
also we talked about creating actionable

00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:36,149
others having cram books information

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,370
from logging and monitoring tools and

00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:40,820
last we talked about learning from our

00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,840
experiences which is mostly about

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,130
reporting and collecting all those

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,899
things and creating blame is

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,970
post-mortems so I really like this like

00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,440
I definitely recommend that you even if

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,840
you are impressions folks developers

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,409
whether like if you're an IT you need to

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,500
write you need to read the new site

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:03,929
reliability workbook so even if you read

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,659
the first book this gives more context

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,970
and more practical knowledge on on the

00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,559
site reliability engineering

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,299
and they say we never achieve

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,770
reliability at the expense of a non-call

00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,780
engine yourself this is very important

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,210
so we need to of course we need to be a

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,490
parent we need to have you know virtual

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,679
systems but it doesn't worth it if you

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,720
if you are sacrificing from sacrificing

00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,679
from your engine yourself and it then it

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,240
all comes to caring about your people

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,830
whatever like whatever you do you need

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,590
to care about your people you need to

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,400
put your people first that is the key to

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,530
everything

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,840
so I recommend two books again the site

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:42,390
rabbit workbook also if you want to

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,610
learn more about what how to how to act

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,309
during major incidents so this book

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,710
incident management for patients talks

00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,600
about how firefighters deal with

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,070
incidents major incidents and how you

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,100
can apply those practices to IT

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,980
incidents so it's very useful book that

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,720
you can read about incident management

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,960
so these are my references I will share

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:12,270
my presentation from my teacher account

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:14,880
thank you very much that's all thank you

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:18,240
so there's some time for questions left

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,210
are there any questions the room so far

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,559
so I'm also thinking about like I'm not

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,309
sure if I will but I'm thinking about

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,740
doing taking the empty slot tomorrow and

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,960
talk about how did we deal with the

00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,630
monitoring of serverless functions so we

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,010
use a SS termed a top skinny and we

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,780
developed our own tool and you know

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,370
spend a lot of time how to get

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,120
visibility into a double standard

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:44,760
functions so I will try to come up with

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,299
an 8 in presentation and I have one

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,350
question

00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:52,320
so do you give the advice to use run

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:56,100
books so it's the tool you can suggest

00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:00,150
or do you still believe in planning

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,789
papers and whiteboards or so what we do

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,470
is we have easy ways to just add

00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:07,770
additional information on to other stops

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,120
Chinni but and so if you have a lot of

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,890
different services we don't have a like

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,940
central place that you can Minstrels yet

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,399
I'm not sure when this is gonna come yes

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,730
you can use confluence I will suggest

00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,730
that

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,550
but we just joined so at last answer and

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:29,090
also some some companies like it lab

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,830
they use get to Manish there ROM books I

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,570
have some merchants and confidence as

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,000
versioning as also use conference we

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:44,360
always use your a status finish

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,480
confidence I want to be on the open

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:50,060
source site so I'm not yeah I love the

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,370
idea about the uncle shadowing is it

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:56,930
something that you are using so it's not

00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:59,210
a tool so yes we put yes we have yes yes

00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,880
if you what have you found that works or

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:07,820
does not work in this this procedure

00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:09,920
this practice so if you mean if it's in

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,820
the middle of tonight probably like it's

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,320
hard to if it's most of the time the

00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:20,150
alerts parents really like major

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:23,540
incidents if if they are they get into

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:25,130
call so we have this video bridge so

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,170
they can easily use like I've seen it to

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,710
talk to teach meet each other or you can

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,480
you zoom or whatever in our case they

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:37,130
use that so they basically come together

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,260
and discuss the incident together but at

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,660
first we put the on call engineers

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,610
during business days so it's easier if

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,190
like they come together easily within

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,860
the same office and actually before

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,350
putting engineers in the night night on

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,210
calls we spend like uncle engineer spent

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,940
around three or five months doing

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,310
business ours being on call because it

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,950
helps it makes that easier to just go

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:04,010
and ask someone else how to deal with an

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,800
alert in strike doing this remotely is a

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,860
lot harder than of course doing is side

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,230
by side so we spend like first we spend

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,920
out of time doing everything in the in

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:19,880
the same office and then we then start

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,870
way around so when they are on call of

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,490
business hours

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,430
mostly they know how to deal with these

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:27,170
things so shadowing is mostly about

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:30,230
first doing these things during business

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,940
hours so it's easier is most is fact we

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,000
I don't remember like having a specific

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,659
problem

00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,570
with this okay there was one question

00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:42,480
left

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:45,390
you talked about routing the eyelets the

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,240
right people but of business hours it

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,340
would mean you have to have a lot of

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,780
people on calls yeah because there is

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,059
that's the case for yes that is

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,200
basically what one of the most important

00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:00,539
things that obscene sauce okay so I need

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,950
to advertise so basically if you're I

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,659
can drink out of those dollars from

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,720
monitoring tools you have some sort of

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,960
key differentiators maybe from the on

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,520
the alerts like which service that this

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
alert belongs to so you have all those

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,880
services and themes defined on scene II

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,880
and we can easily route those orders to

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,799
the right team and all those teams like

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,919
who is on call and what time is already

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,630
defined enough senior so it's easy so

00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,640
traditionally it's hard that is one of

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,230
the reasons option is valuable so most

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,490
of the time you can just send emails if

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,580
you are using nag years you can send

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,669
emails but it's not easy to route to the

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:38,190
right team or right person with the

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:42,570
multiple notification options like SMS

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,520
message called mobile notification so

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:53,190
basically only thing about this is about

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:55,470
of senior okay it's two questions so sad

00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,020
thank you for being here giving us this

00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:00,000
talk so here's a little present for you

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,290
as a thing thank you so thank you for my

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,330
thanks no I can't

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:16,180
