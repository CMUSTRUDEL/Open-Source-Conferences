Title: OSMC 2018 | Logging is coming to Grafana by David Kaltschmidt
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Grafana is an OSS dashboarding platform with a focus on visualising time.series data as beautiful graphs. Now we’re adding support to show your logs inside Grafana as well. Adding support for log aggregation makes Grafana an even better tool for incident response: First, the metric graphs help in a visual zoning in on the issue. Then you can seamlessly switch over to view and search related log files, allowing you to better understand what your software was doing while the issue was occurring. The main part of this talk shows how to deploy the necessary parts for this integrated experience. In addition I’ll show the latest features of Grafana both for creating dashboards and maintaining their configuration. The last 10-15 will be reserved for a Q&A.
