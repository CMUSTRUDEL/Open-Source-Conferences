Title: OSMC 2018 | OpenNMS Geschäftsbericht by Tarus Balog

Description: 
	Ha ha, fooled you. This talk will be in English, but I did learn a new German noun. Back in 2015 the OpenNMS Project split the code into two main branches: Horizon and Meridian. To compare it to Red Hat, think of Horizon as Fedora and Meridian as RHEL. Doing this allowed the team to greatly increase the release cycle of OpenNMS, as Horizon major releases occur once every three to four months. This presentation will cover the changes to OpenNMS introduced since the last OSMC, which includes releases Horizon 21, 22 and 23. The major new features include support for Minions (H21). No, not the little yellow guys shaped like medicine capsules, but a technology to both distribute OpenNMS functionality and make it redundant, perfect for large scale or IoT deployments. Another feature is “telemetryd” (H22) which adds the ability to collect and store “flow” data from protocols such as Netflow, JFlow and Sflow. And finally there is Project Sextant (H23) that adds high level alarm correlation to OpenNMS. Also new this year is support for the MQTT protocol that allows OpenNMS to talk to IoT gateways such Eclipse Kura. While it is hoped this talk with be informative, as an American and I assure you it will be loud (unless the organizers stick me as the first speaker on the second day, then it might be quieter).
