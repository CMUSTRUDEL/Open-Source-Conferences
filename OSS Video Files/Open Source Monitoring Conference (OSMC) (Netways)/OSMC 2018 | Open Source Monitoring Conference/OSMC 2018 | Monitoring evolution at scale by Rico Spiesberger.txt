Title: OSMC 2018 | Monitoring evolution at scale by Rico Spiesberger
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The story starts 13 years ago with brave heroes mastering the IT monitoring of a worldwide company with more than 20k employees. Their adventure begins with a closed source tool and over the years, it has been replaced with many open source tools to solve challenges within the growing IT landscape. This talk highlights the changes and challenges involved with the tools and their functionality in contrast to todayâ€™s requirement of business processes and daily sysadmin workflows. Changes were sometimes rough, but the trust earned from SEC and NOC operators using an automated, highly distributed Icinga 2 monitoring solution proves the right decision. This story has everything: pain, cuts, happiness, eat-your-keyboard and finally the feeling of success on the road to reliable unified monitoring with applied workflows and happy users.
