Title: OSMC 2018 | Introduction to OpenTracing by Carlos Alberto Cortez
Publication date: 2018-11-19
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	OpenTracing is an effort to provide a vendor neutral API for distributed tracing, which can be used to trace both applications and OSS packages. Behind it stands the concept of distributed tracing: to measure the performance of application requests spanning many micro services. Using the OpenTracing API, developers can instrument their code without binding to any particular vendor (Jaeger, ZipKin, LightStep, etc). The API supports Span (request) management, inter-process propagation, active Span management, to name a few. Moreover, the specification works on a cross-language basis. This presentation is intended mostly for engineers working on distributed systems, and besides a full introduction to OpenTracing and its architecture, attendants will understand the elements that make up a successful tracing implementation. Finally, a small demo will be shown using to showcase OpenTracing at work using Jaeger, an Open Source tracing system released by Uber.
