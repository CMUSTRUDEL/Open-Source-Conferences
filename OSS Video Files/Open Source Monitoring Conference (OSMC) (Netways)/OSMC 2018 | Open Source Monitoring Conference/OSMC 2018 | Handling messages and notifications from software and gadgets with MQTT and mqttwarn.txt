Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	... by Jan-Piet Mens

MQTT is a simple, lightweight, TCP-based protocol which can be used for having “things” such as sensors report data, but it can also be used in your software projects as a flexible method of distributing messages and notifications. In this talk we will show you what MQTT is, what its Last Wills and Testaments can do for monitoring your long-running processes, and how you can route MQTT messages through brokers. We will show you some examples of real-world MQTT use, and we discuss the mqttwarn utility which allows you to decouple MQTT message notifications from your systems. Be warned: there will be blinkenlights!
