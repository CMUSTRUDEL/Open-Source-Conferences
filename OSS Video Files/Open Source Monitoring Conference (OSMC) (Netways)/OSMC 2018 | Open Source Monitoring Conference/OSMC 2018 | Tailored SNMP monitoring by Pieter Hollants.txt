Description: 
	â€“ Your own SNMP MIB and sub-agent with Python and python-netsnmpagent - 

SNMP continues to be a essential component in monitoring where the information being made available is structured in so-called Management Information (MIB) modules. The standard net-snmp distribution comes a with a variety of standard MIBs implemented by its snmpd, but sometimes there is the need to make your own information available via SNMP. Luckily snmpd can be dynamically extended by so-called subagents implementing the AgentX protocol (RFC2747). The net-snmp API however pretty much focusses on the C programming language only, laying the entrance barrier especially for non-developers rather high. In this talk Pieter will not only demonstrate the creation of a MIB, which, being a text file, is the easier part, but also how easy it is to implement a simple subagent in Python using his python-netsnmpagent module. python-netsnmpagent is a shim wrapper over the net-snmp C API trying to implement just enough abstraction. Licensed under the GPL it is available at https://github.com/pief/python-netsnmpagent as well as PyPI.
