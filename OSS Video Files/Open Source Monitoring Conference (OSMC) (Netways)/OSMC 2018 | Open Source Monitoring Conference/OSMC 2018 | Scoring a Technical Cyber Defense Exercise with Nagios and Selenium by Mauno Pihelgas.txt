Publication date: 2018-11-19
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	This talk is about building an availability scoring system for the annual international cyber defence exercise Locked Shields. The scoring solution is built around Nagios Core, accompanied by several tools (e.g., Selenium WebDriver) and custom scripts. In 2018, we had to monitor 3,080 hosts with 31,350 services with checks performed at least once per minute. During 16 hours of game-play, 34 million scoring checks were performed and logged, which averages at about 35,000 active checks per minute.
