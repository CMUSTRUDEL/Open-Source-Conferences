Description: 
	If you are wondering what it takes to get paid to build monitoring solutions, this is the talk for you. From getting started, to design, implementation and support of monitoring systems, I will uncover the secrets of how the professionals do it. Ideas on how to engage with customers, how to sell the idea to management and various stake holders, what to look out for when building systems, and how to actually get paid to do it. Even if you arenâ€™t looking to branch out as a monitoring professional, other users will benefit from some of the softer skills and advice, to increase adoption and ultimately the success of your monitoring project.
