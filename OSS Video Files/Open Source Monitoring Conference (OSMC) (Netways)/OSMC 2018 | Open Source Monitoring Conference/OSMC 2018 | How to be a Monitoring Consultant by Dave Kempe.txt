Title: OSMC 2018 | How to be a Monitoring Consultant by Dave Kempe
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	If you are wondering what it takes to get paid to build monitoring solutions, this is the talk for you. From getting started, to design, implementation and support of monitoring systems, I will uncover the secrets of how the professionals do it. Ideas on how to engage with customers, how to sell the idea to management and various stake holders, what to look out for when building systems, and how to actually get paid to do it. Even if you arenâ€™t looking to branch out as a monitoring professional, other users will benefit from some of the softer skills and advice, to increase adoption and ultimately the success of your monitoring project.

[Music]

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,410
[Applause]

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,769
all right everyone hear me thanks for

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,420
coming I'd like this to be quite

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,769
interactive if possible and have

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,630
everyone interrupt and ask questions

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,250
because I haven't really prepared very

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,769
well I figured it wasn't going to be a

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,090
big deal because you know I'm really

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,550
just kind of talking about what I do for

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,469
a living so that shouldn't be too hard

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,550
but the structure and all those kind of

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,920
things we'll see how we go

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,469
so first they've been about me as

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,899
discussed I've run a IT services

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,550
business I'm kind of like the Australian

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,050
net weighs a little bit you know we've

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,090
got a bunch of staff that work for us

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,620
and so I'm here to give away all our

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,699
secrets and make them quite annoyed

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,270
which is where they put me at the end of

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,730
the day so here we are

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,850
that includes we hope we have our own

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,549
hosting environment so we host stuff for

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,610
customers racks in data centers and we

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,740
also provide outsourced services to

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,439
other customers that have their own

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,240
infrastructure and so we get a both a

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
kind of direct customer relationship as

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,299
well as sort of consulting as well as

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
building monitoring systems for the

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,170
other customers and all the sort of

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,790
things in between so we deal with

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,840
embedded systems through the large

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,619
storage systems and anything in between

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,320
so the next question is who are you guys

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,200
so who he sort of works in our kind of

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,259
consulting role or works in a consulting

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,200
role Julian you guys I'm not sure what

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,200
you're all doing here then really like

00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,990
did you read the topic you got the wrong

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,690
talk because the Maps module is really

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,320
cool I wanted to go to that one you all

00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,860
want to know yeah okay well we'll see

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,440
how we go

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,360
so as for the rest of you I'm actually

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,950
really genuinely trying to give

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,550
something back to the community I have

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,900
done reasonably well out of the work

00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,050
that I've done through a lot of hard

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,850
work and effort I'm I'm you know happy

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,680
with my level of success we're happy

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,270
with the life that I've managed to make

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,600
for myself through consulting on open

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,760
source software and you know very

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,140
grateful to the to the shoulders of the

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,970
Giants that I've been able to stand on

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,740
that have made software that is you know

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,630
it enabled me to get a job done that I

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,330
enjoy and then it's productive so

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,660
hopefully you know that's something you

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,990
guys want to and I'm genuinely gonna

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,180
hopefully give you a hand getting there

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,590
so what is monitoring mean to various

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,050
people this the old prison guard not

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,500
watching and the obligatory Dilbert

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,350
cartoon kind of sums it up for a lot of

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,239
times you get a boss that says well we

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,040
need some monitoring so they go out and

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,680
kind of Google I want some monitoring or

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,050
they hit up their local kind of reseller

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,690
of whatever IT they use and they buy the

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,670
you know latest and shiniest kind of GUI

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,410
that does all-singing all-dancing kind

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,220
of things and then no one ever pays

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,170
attention to it

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,970
you know they or they they buy something

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,500
that's you know cloud enabled and they

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,400
can deploy on all their whole things and

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,989
then it's just a big noisy mess so the

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,070
other thing is monitoring itself means a

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,700
bunch of different things to different

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,640
people

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,250
I don't you guys probably don't really

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:31,320
read the Australian news but just today

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:36,570
or yesterday a iron ore train crashed in

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,580
Western Australia and it somehow the

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,860
driver got out as a train that's driven

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,970
by a single driver it's kilometers long

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,350
the Train

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,730
somehow the driver got out to check on

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:49,140
something the train got away from him

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,580
and it got 93 kilometers down the track

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,709
before they figured out how to get it

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,640
off the track and now the entire train

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,350
all you know hundreds of sort of can you

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,610
ge laners full

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,680
of I nor is now in pieces and PHP is

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,820
quite upset and you know it'll affect

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,430
production schedules and all those kind

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,110
of things bottom line is there's a team

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,180
of people that monitor that train that

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,560
you know run over fiber-optic cables

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,320
from thousands of kilometers away and

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,330
there's a guy whose job it is and as

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,980
you'll see monitoring means lots of

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,330
different ins different people and I'll

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,060
also hopefully come to the point where

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:29,580
we can engender in our customers a

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,350
culture has one down of every outage is

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,180
a failure of monitoring and I want to

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,490
get to that that point so what is the

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,310
problem and why they're failures and

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,230
when you walk into a customer and say

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,230
you know hey I think we can do

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,850
monitoring better

00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,550
there aren't any shortage of tools that

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,500
tick all the boxes there are plenty of

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,510
things out there that will be out will

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,150
do the job a couple of really great

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,590
options a couple of trends in how we do

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,540
things differently as Mick pointed out

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,800
it all kind of looks the same though

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,220
after a while at the end of the day the

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,710
real problem though is a combination of

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,300
tools processes and people and then you

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,830
as a consultant is hopefully even to

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,260
join all those things together into a

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,610
actual cohesive solution and you can

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,130
tell the majority is really not the

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,440
tools that most of the work is involved

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,360
in actually figuring out what the

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,290
problems are what we care about how

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,240
we're going to get people to pay

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,220
attention to those problems and then

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,050
make sure that the train doesn't get

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,640
derailed off the track or we lose a

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,850
whole bunch of people's data or or bad

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,670
things happen so there there are other

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,380
other problems I'll work through as well

00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,600
the feedback loop of getting things

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,320
worked out and integrating two project

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,780
timelines and all those kind of things

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:55,470
the other thing is getting people's

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:59,460
attention so the amount of you know your

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,250
typical alert might go off and people

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,630
eventually ignore it or they figure out

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,580
a way of turning things off I've had a

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,140
number of customers where they had major

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,970
outages because the guy that was on call

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,760
turned his phone off you know and forgot

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,650
to turn it back on and or

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,290
another customer recently where that a

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,050
dashboard that was alerting and they had

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,640
27 hours worth of outage with no you

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,350
know with no kind of alert because the

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,930
alert itself wasn't getting in there in

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,600
their faces and the the NOC team that

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,480
was staffed 24 by 7 just failed to you

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,620
know see that red dot or I have no idea

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,070
what what that what they were doing but

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,020
or not doing but ultimately you need to

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,270
be able to get people's attention and I

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,400
mean that's sort of the key you know it

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,330
seems like a fundamental fact but when

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,310
you're building a monitoring system

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,230
getting people's attention about things

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,810
that we care about is really the crux of

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,610
it and and you know if you're if your

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,410
job is to help a company do that then

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,780
that's the you need to have in your head

00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,820
as you walk into a customer these kind

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,560
of ideas what am I here to do I'm here

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,960
to help these people care about their

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,360
own stuff and like that sounds like a

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,090
kind of simplistic way of putting it but

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,410
it's very easy for your average IT guy

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,720
and we've all seen them they turn up

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,250
every day and sit at their computer and

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,110
they reply to some emails and they sit

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,100
in a bunch of meetings and then you know

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,450
that's like one of those crappy

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,040
conference calls you know where people

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,570
are leaving and then they go home at the

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,550
end of the day and and it's very easy to

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,010
kind of get kind of pretty apathetic

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,170
about how things work very common in

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,080
large organizations who here knows some

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,200
people who are apathetic about their job

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,450
no one come on come on

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,860
so anyway bottom line is getting

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,770
people's attention so they actually care

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,240
is is actually not it's not just about

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,820
getting an alert it's actually about

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,170
sitting alongside people and saying you

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,810
know what if we improve this situation

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,730
if we actually can say well you know

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,650
that's read for a reason and if we made

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,240
it green then this other guy's not going

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,210
to get annoyed at you and your life will

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,740
be much happier that can make a big

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,630
difference people can actually be happy

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,090
to come to work I suppose but you know

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,860
we'll see how we go so the other thing I

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,720
wanted to point out is that monitoring

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,580
and as a consultant is it's all about

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,940
service delivery I feel like we forget

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,980
very easily in IT and infrastructure and

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,660
applications and all the hipster cool

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,560
things we're doing these days containers

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,900
and DevOps that really most of what we

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,389
do is servants of industry we

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,120
we exist so that other businesses can

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:33,330
actually make money we exist to provide

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,919
the platform for people to sell iron ore

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:40,169
or make TV work or build laptops or

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,029
whatever it might be so and it's very

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,339
easy to forget that you know you you you

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:46,650
have an empire it's really cool you've

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,150
got all the latest flashy things you go

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,300
to cool conferences and make crazy

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,920
people and you know really our job is to

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,170
make sure other people's jobs and their

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,820
businesses work properly and so the

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,459
monetary system has to ultimately serve

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,070
that purpose it has to deliver to the

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,020
business infrastructure that's reliable

00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,089
and our job is to serve you know those

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:12,930
businesses so how do we get started

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:14,520
sorry about the bad jokes so first thing

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,490
I would do is figure out what people

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,900
care about thanks me he's much better at

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,850
google image search than I am so and

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,140
that's a hard thing I've had plenty of

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,790
people come to me and say Dave you know

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,760
we've got this thing over here and it's

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,959
monitoring and I hear you're doing some

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,000
monitoring stuff I'm like yeah okay and

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,680
they're like well here you go and like

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,310
well what is that and how does it work

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,800
and anyone used emc isilon

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,080
before anyone large storage array you

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,250
know cost millions of dollars that kind

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,860
of stuff I'd never seen it before

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,110
now I'm an expert you know uh-huh I'm

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,630
genuinely actually an expert uh-huh and

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,410
and I suppose at the end of the day the

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,060
other thing I'd point out about

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,050
monitoring just from a consulting point

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,050
of view is that it's pretty much a

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,770
gateway drug with you if you have some

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,060
IT services skills and you know you know

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,709
how Linux work you know how Windows

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,260
works and or networking or however it

00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:09,029
might work then going to customers and

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,250
saying I can provide monitoring for you

00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,350
is a great way of figuring out what

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,690
their problems are shining a light on

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,209
those problems and then helping you fix

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,490
them you can generate a lot of billable

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,830
hours from being able to say well you

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,839
know really this cluster is broken or

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,850
you know look at this I found a whole

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,650
bunch of dead disks or and hopefully you

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,470
resell discs you know that kind of stuff

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,320
so those are things next things to do is

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:38,550
is you know drill down as I said what

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,850
else have I got here oh the other thing

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,769
I would

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:46,380
say is about how to get started is I am

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:49,050
NOT a big fan of auto-discovery systems

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,050
there's plenty of tools out there you

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,759
know commercial tools that they're like

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,199
great you can just plunk it down and it

00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,940
just figures everything out and draw a

00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,980
big map for you and what do you know

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,540
you've got alerts on power supplies that

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,250
you don't care about and fan speed you

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,009
don't care about and there's thousands

00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,620
of alarms and it ends up being a nun

00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:09,810
totally unmanageable mess so I always

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,660
start with my customers with a

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,730
completely blank slate and I say right

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:18,209
let's start with the top top ten things

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,399
you care about those things are not disk

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,100
space they're systems you know they're

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,660
like here is a and different businesses

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,490
will divide systems into different

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,980
things depending on how their teams are

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,449
structured here is a system this is the

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,279
most important system to our business

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:33,990
let's make sure that works you know if

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,759
it was Domino's it'd be the pizza oven

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,589
you know it's really important that that

00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,410
thing is working we need to write a

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:43,410
dashboard that says the pizza oven is

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,300
working and and until we've done that

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,589
and got that right we don't move on to

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,819
the next thing we don't generate a whole

00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,160
lot more noise we have a completely

00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,480
blank slate and monitor the crap out of

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,050
that pits are over until it's perfect

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,209
and keep going and because collectively

00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,420
as an organization you need to get good

00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:03,329
at getting good I know that sounds weird

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,430
but you know when you start with

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:08,699
something and you polish it nicely other

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,740
people come along and when the alerts go

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:13,139
from being you know red green red green

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,329
yellow all sorts of other colors to oh

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,980
there's a dashboard there it says that

00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,720
it's green and I haven't got any alerts

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,279
and you know what that really means it

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,410
means that something is checking that

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,300
system and it is actually working you

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,130
don't have to worry anymore you actually

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,889
have a machine doing a bunch of work for

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,639
you it automates the idea of service

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,040
delivery and building the faith that you

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,279
have in that the staff have in your

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,509
monitoring system is super important so

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,310
having the ability to be able to say

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,930
when it says it's green

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,779
it really is green it means it actually

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,189
has been checked it's not a you know and

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,620
that's why I hate passive checks by the

00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:50,660
way you know it doesn't you know it

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,980
knows that it's really

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,810
and you want to make sure that there's a

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,699
right side failure I was talking to

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,319
earlier about trains you know we have a

00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,430
customer that does a bunch of trains and

00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,170
they're always talking about right side

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,629
failure when they build systems which

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,180
means you know when the system fails no

00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,500
one gets hurt you know the point is the

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,509
Train goes straight off the tracks or

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,470
something like that the train disasters

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:13,879
aside but yeah so building faith in the

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,430
system is really important and starting

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:21,490
clean is the I feel the best way to do

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:24,980
that yeah where is my mouse gone oh yeah

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:29,000
so the other thing that I see a lot is

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,889
monitoring as you know to various types

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,870
your time series data and state change

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:37,129
data now I'm a big fan of state change

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,589
before the reason that I that I talked

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:41,360
about before I know Julian little you

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:46,790
know disagree but he tends to shoehorn

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,769
different things in my point is to build

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,540
faith in a system that delivers service

00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,819
to the business they need to have a

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,500
positive very simple binary way of

00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,630
measuring what's going on you got a

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,220
traffic light it says it's okay it's

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,050
okay everyone has faith that it's okay

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,240
and they can relax and get on with

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,920
actually building important systems

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,750
instead of freaking out about things

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,170
what I don't like about an interface

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,689
like this is that for the purpose of

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,399
service delivery it just confuses people

00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:15,439
there's a bunch of graphs and they don't

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,120
really know if those graphs are exactly

00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,990
what we want so you end up to have to

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,389
bolt on a state change check to a time

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,759
series time series data time series data

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,560
is super important for an analysis super

00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,779
important to figure out what happened to

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,160
you know dig in things and go well at

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,300
this time there was a spike here and a

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,880
spike there therefore we've got this

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,889
problem very important don't not collect

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,149
time series data but when you're trying

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,660
to live a service you're going to end up

00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:45,079
with a at some point a binary check that

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,529
figures out what's going on all right

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:49,339
what else have we got I've got a I've

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:50,720
got a note here that says using

00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:54,439
whiteboard but I don't have a whiteboard

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,029
so that's a shame so the next thing I

00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:58,100
would do is figure out the life cycle of

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,730
a monitored event so is everyone

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,490
familiar with these kind of States

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:07,640
roughly hopefully I'm preaching to

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,080
require a little bit the reason we had a

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,310
note here to say use a whiteboard is

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,020
because actually a really important way

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,990
of getting people into a room and

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,360
drawing a diagram and I really believe

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,880
in drawing as I talk my drawings are

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,740
terrible much worse than the last guy's

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,380
drawing so if you're in that previous

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,330
talk but it doesn't matter because

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,399
people understand what's going on when

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,060
you when you draw something and and I

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,240
think having a having a a workflow that

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,110
lays things out and in this case I would

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:43,310
use a diagram like this to say you know

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:45,170
it's okay and service check is okay once

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,700
every five minutes you know and then

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,930
actually figure out what the times are

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,399
and this might be one minute

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,370
and then we start to move on to

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,649
obsession obsession is the decreasing

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,810
frequency of checks between these states

00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,850
and then so you draw a time line out and

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,410
go right that's 30 seconds now we're at

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,730
four minutes you know and then at four

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,800
at five minutes we're going to notify

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,390
and then at ten minutes we're going to

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,830
escalate and if we don't acknowledge

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,779
we're going to escalate again and

00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,930
hopefully going to move on to resolution

00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,010
so these are the this understanding of

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,410
what happens when something goes wrong

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,209
it needs to be really clear and I'd like

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,440
to sort of draw it up and print it out

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,540
and stick it on the wall so people

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,790
understand what the expectation is about

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,410
if I get an alert how long has it

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,029
actually been down for how does it

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,120
actually work what's the expectation

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:33,890
there what kind of mess have I got

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,990
myself into all right so what else we

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,440
got check things people actually care

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,640
about I big believer in this what's the

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,200
point of a monitoring tool if no-one

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,100
pays attention to it that's that's a

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,500
good question but the other problem with

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,040
this is defining what's really important

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,480
to a business is often quite difficult

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,160
you know that could be buried in an

00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,110
annual report and it's the revenue they

00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,190
make from some real estate deal you know

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,750
and you can't monitor that stuff very

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,640
easily so you know often what happens is

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,380
I will wander around the building and

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,470
ask people whose job it is is to have

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,910
the monitors open or to take the tickets

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,010
from the customers or however it might

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,209
be and say you know what's important to

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,290
you for your business or what's

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,399
important for you to get your job done

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,289
and try and figure out how to monitor

00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:21,850
my business we have a bunch of SL a s

00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,769
anyone else have SL A's that they work

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,659
towards you know service level

00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:27,220
agreements you get paid if you don't you

00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,419
know don't get paid if you don't respond

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,490
in time is really what it comes down to

00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:33,100
so one of the things we do is we monitor

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,659
our ticketing system to make sure that

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,019
we're responding to customers in time

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:39,909
and the on-call person's job part of

00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:42,399
that is to make sure everyone else is

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:43,659
meeting the SLA s so you know we have

00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,490
other monetary systems that create

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,289
tickets and then another monetary system

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,929
that monitors that ticketing queue to

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,610
make sure that that's getting done and

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,559
because my business is in the business

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,179
of service delivery that's important to

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,490
us and it really enforces an actual

00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,809
genuinely you know core business

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,419
proposition we offer to our customers

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,950
and I can say to them you know here we

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,289
go we've got back to you within this

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,429
period of time that would be totally

00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,250
different for different people you know

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,570
there'll be different things about

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,639
business processes and what the key

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,500
indicators are and how that all works

00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:16,509
for different people I've got a customer

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,049
where we you know they receive a data

00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:22,509
feed for television station and the data

00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,340
goes on air and people bet on this data

00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:28,029
it's really important horse-racing odds

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:30,669
and things like that and that everything

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:32,409
is triple redundant so data feeds come

00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:34,360
into three different servers and we have

00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:36,129
a custom plug in we wrote that compares

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,539
the data of those three different

00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,980
services that they have to be within

00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:43,809
accurate within one minute it's like a

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:46,330
streaming kind of check and before

00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:48,460
before we wrote that check everyone was

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,990
doing a whole series of manual things

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,149
they're logging into databases and

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,129
literally running manual SQL queries

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,149
like multiple times a day to check to

00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:57,070
see what was happening and what was

00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:58,960
actually in the database and all those

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,250
things and then after writing that check

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,629
and letting it settle for awhile and

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,370
getting people used to the fact that it

00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:05,590
actually works properly and it says that

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,809
it's okay a whole bunch of you know like

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,090
load was lifted off the system sort of

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,529
mentally so people kind of were able to

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,529
move on and start building something

00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:16,779
else that wasn't as crap but you know

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,940
you actually have to you know create a

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:20,980
robust business process and check that

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,809
exact business process for people to

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,500
have that kind of sense of relief that

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:29,679
they're not constantly fighting fires

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,000
alright so how about the right tools I

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,730
added this right last min

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,220
probably probably a bit too late so I

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,890
have a kind of passion for open source

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,210
as open source monitoring conference

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,490
choosing what the right tools are is

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,470
something that probably comes with a

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,670
fair bit of experience but I'd like to

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,830
kind of walk through a couple of these

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,830
bullet points and explain but in detail

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,710
the what is a healthy open source

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,270
project well I mean a healthy project is

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,970
one that is actually open source all the

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:00,610
way through and I'm a big believer in

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,970
that because it needs to be malleable

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,410
which is the last point there that being

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,000
when you are building a monitor system

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,310
you're encoding what's important to a

00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,720
business in that system and that system

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,280
will be a series of components will be

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,230
something that checks things something

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,420
that maybe alerts them or graphs them or

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:20,740
and the plugins that make it all

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,930
complicated and and invalid but you need

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,240
to have a tool that's flexible enough

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,330
that you can really just change parts of

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,970
it adapt it contribute to it make a big

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,770
difference so and proprietary tools just

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,150
simply don't do it I haven't come across

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,560
a single proprietary tool that has

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,110
anywhere near the level of flexibility

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,970
required to do that and to really

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,120
express what's important to a business

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,400
they they all fall down in some way it's

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,660
sad to say so you do that through some

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,460
api's the other thing that's really

00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,370
important is that it can be distributed

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,280
your modern environment you know with

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,020
firewalls and different branches and all

00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,690
those kind of things just distributed

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,600
monitoring is very important and I

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:05,320
wouldn't pick a tool without it scalable

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,390
and integrating with things two

00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,240
important things I scale is one of those

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:12,700
things that means many different things

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,270
for different people you know you can

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,430
have you know a cluster of servers you

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:21,220
know tens of thousands of checks or your

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:23,410
scale can be one of my customers you

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,600
know their idea of scale is really about

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,160
the time it takes to get between the

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,780
things they're monitoring because it

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,210
cost a lot of money to drive a thousand

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,440
kilometers to fix something so they need

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,450
to have better monitoring of that

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,950
particular place so they don't have to

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,310
drive this often because that cost a lot

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,970
of money so that when you think about it

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,380
that's a scaling issue in the sense that

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,600
it's all about sort of the

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,520
of how it works and being able to have a

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,770
very lightweight but detailed view of

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,080
understanding what's going on across

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:57,490
that kind of tyranny of distance is

00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:01,690
really important so integrating with

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,850
various things is important I when I'm

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,260
evaluating a tool you know you can you

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,300
know go to the webpage and have a look

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,410
at it and go well okay so these guys are

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,000
you know they took all these boxes

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,850
integrate with these various things I

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,920
was a bit sad to hear about my one of my

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,200
customers that's moving to ServiceNow

00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,740
there any was service now users here I

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,620
yeah we're talking about that so before

00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:26,140
when we're talking about yesterday and

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,990
you know I don't know if it's correct or

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,340
not but this the consultant was like I

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,440
was like oh so what we want to do is

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,680
create tickets in the ticketing system

00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,150
and then use the API to make sure that

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,470
if the ticket status changes we comment

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,090
on the ticket again we don't make lots

00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,920
of tickets or just send emails I want to

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,400
actually interact with that particular

00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,430
event the way it needs to be and the guy

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,380
was like oh that's that's easily another

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,520
20 grand mate and probably gonna be

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,320
three weeks and it's just not gonna

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,480
happen and I was just like really like

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,610
come on how hard is it I know maybe I'm

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,440
entirely wrong with that who knows maybe

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,480
they've got a bad consultant point being

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,820
is a proprietary tool in ticketing is

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,980
just as bad as a proprietary tool in in

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,360
in your monitoring system because be

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,040
able to join them together in a way that

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:16,180
makes sense for your particular

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:18,370
customers like crucial so the other

00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,610
thing I don't hesitate to write is

00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,530
custom plugins we've written hundreds of

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,390
plugins many of them you know not

00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,580
open-source because customers pay us to

00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,680
write them who he has written a custom

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,930
plugin for their monitoring system yep

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,160
lots of people excellent sorry to keep

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,260
asking questions raise your hand I know

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:40,810
it's the end of the day but just hang in

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:44,260
there exercise I you know and I think

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,580
it's important because every environment

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,500
is going to be slightly different and

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,890
yes you can unify how these checks work

00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:54,550
but to some extent at least in in the

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,140
sort of you know real world that I live

00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,550
in where our customers do real-world

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,940
things and all your people who work in

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:00,279
many

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,169
during a in that deftly in that category

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,309
and that you hipsters with your

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:09,190
kubernetes clusters aren't sorry say

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:11,139
they you know we wanted to real things

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,899
you know pool filters and oxygen

00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:15,340
monitors and baby things and all sorts

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:19,720
of other stuff a point being is that

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:22,899
requires a the ability to be able to

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,289
write something custom SNMP is a massive

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:29,080
letdown I've come across some total SNMP

00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:31,299
disasters my record is six months to get

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,850
a mirror out of a company six months and

00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,950
a CEO signature from both companies with

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,169
a nondisclosure agreement why that's

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,460
ridiculous point being is ended up just

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,830
writing something that's great the web

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,279
interface and was much easier works

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:47,590
reliably SNMP unfortunately was a total

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,850
joke in that regard so you know that

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,659
we're talking about specialist equipment

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,490
here so it's to be expected so I would I

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,500
would suggest that custom plugins are a

00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,690
way that you as a consultant can add

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,429
value to your customer you should treat

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,500
them like you would treat software you

00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:05,860
know that would be you know the correct

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,570
software life cycle have a staging area

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,490
you can test them make sure they're

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,370
committed to revision control their

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,750
intellectual properties so you know they

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,539
probably belong to the customer or not

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,279
and you know and where possible

00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,809
contribute back to other open source

00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,149
projects that have plugins it's it's

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,879
important that we all continue to work

00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:27,490
together so but they are definitely a

00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:29,049
way you can add value as a consultant

00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,379
what that means that I suppose is you

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:33,820
need to know how to write software I

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:37,179
don't claim to write software I write a

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,730
lot of bash scripts and you know that's

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:42,370
a that's a very loose definition of

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:45,490
software but you know having people that

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:48,850
can write code for you think glue things

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,289
together take existing tools and build

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:56,259
plug-ins for customers I think is really

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:59,169
important all right and then hopefully

00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:03,519
we can work towards monitoring nirvana I

00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:08,259
I have a vision for our customers where

00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:10,389
they are able to create a device in a

00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,590
database and it automatically gets

00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:13,990
monitored at automatic

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,539
gets built it automatically gets backed

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,570
up and then when they deleted it goes

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,130
away again now that's not really a

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,390
reality maybe the hipsters with the

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,070
kubernetes stuff you know that is a

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:29,260
reality and hey that's maybe well

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:30,760
thereafter but the it is achievable with

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,299
open-source software it is achievable

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,940
with not too much effort do both even

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,380
onto existing structures the tools that

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,390
we use for a lat

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,610
we've started to use netbooks and I want

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:48,070
to give you a demo of that ansible you

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:54,039
know API is for our ginger and various

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:55,690
other things and I think as consultants

00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,760
when you Wendy when you when we talk to

00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,500
people taking them on the journey where

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,809
they go from sort of a blank slate with

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,610
no automation or monitoring all the way

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:05,500
through to being fully automated is

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,659
something that we need to figure out

00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,340
where they're at and work towards that

00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,620
you know you know if I've wandered into

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,029
people's places and said you know oh you

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,559
know we can do all this great stuff when

00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,669
we want to write some play books and

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,590
make all this happen and they sort of

00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:19,270
just scratch the head looking a bit

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,980
blankly and just don't kind of get it so

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,049
you need to start at the beginning with

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,000
people have the right tools make them

00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:26,919
feel that they're welcome and come up

00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,779
with a plan that makes sense for where

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:30,130
their staff are at and where their

00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:32,309
business is out and all those kind of

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,600
things it's not a one-size-fits-all

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:36,370
solution and you can't come in there and

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,760
just kick heads you actually have to

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,020
gently figure out where they're up to

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,240
suggest right how about we do this how

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,789
about we do this and you'll get to the

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,610
point where the vision can be achieved

00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,330
now the reason why I want to have a show

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:54,130
you net box is I sort of I don't know

00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,140
grew like it recently sort of a bit of a

00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,270
phase I'm going through who knows I

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,630
don't suck just yet

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:05,890
whoops and so I actually stuck it on a

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:09,190
docker container on my machine and net

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,600
box is a open source IP address

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,850
management so that asset management

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,210
system by digitalocean the hosting

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,659
company

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:21,880
it's runs Jango and Postgres and is

00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:24,549
pretty cool the you know so it has

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,760
organizations sites tenants and racks I

00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,010
do

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:32,470
chucked in a rack here and the zoom kind

00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,500
of sucks on this we can scroll down and

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:39,750
see Iraq so it has a view of Iraq and

00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:42,940
you know Iraq rack has entities and

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,340
machines have interfaces and interfaces

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,790
have IP addresses if I pick this VMware

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,860
server it's a blade in a blade chassis

00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:53,400
and it's got IP addresses and it's

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:58,530
connect to this anyone else Usenet box

00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,850
do you like it yeah excellent

00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,540
the reason why I think it's good is

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,340
because it basically very succinctly

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,800
expresses what a modern data center

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:14,200
looks like it understands VR F's and

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:16,090
VLANs and NAT and virtualization and all

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,030
those kind of things and it does so in a

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,280
very simple kind of this is just what I

00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:24,330
do kind of way so this comes back to

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,620
choosing tools that you believe in and

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,660
the reason why this appeals to me is

00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,850
because it does just the job that I

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,560
needed to do and it has a good API that

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,180
can be built into other things so

00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,380
there's an answerable module in the

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,370
latest version of ansible that will

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:41,620
query net box for objects you know via

00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:43,060
the API and you can go right you know I

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,310
want to run a playbook against all the

00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,870
machines in this rack or all the Linux

00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,820
boxes in this data center you know those

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:52,450
kind of things you can tag you know

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,850
devices with operating systems and you

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,650
know various custom metrics and all

00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:00,090
those kind of things so these are the

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:03,570
devices I added a blade chassis has

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,190
Bay's you have parents and children and

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:10,270
then coming on to the monitoring part of

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:16,210
it if I pick I think this particular guy

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:18,820
you can add a service to a to a machine

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:23,320
and then you know set up some basic

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,450
level of monitoring on that via the API

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,860
because there is a arching the director

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:32,470
import module a port 76 that'll work so

00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,600
you can actually import services and

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,250
have some basic level of tracking now

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,660
this isn't going to be a total solution

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,500
obviously need a lot more information

00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,020
than that

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,420
you can use tags manage secrets and a

00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,330
bunch of other things but you know for

00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,280
the price which is $0 near box is a

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,930
fantastic solution and really beats a

00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,240
lot of proprietary things out there so

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:55,090
we replaced other proprietary IP address

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,630
management systems with this and been

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,980
very happy with the results and I go

00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,080
back to why that's important it's not a

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,080
monitoring tool but it's the source of

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,880
truth that is easy to manage easy

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,380
integrate with other things and then

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,210
should flow into a monitoring

00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,430
configuration management you need that

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:15,010
source of truth many people have you

00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:16,420
know a spreadsheet or some old dude in

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,880
the basement that knows where things go

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,470
or how that all works but this is a

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,230
structured way of doing it it's a joy to

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,310
use a joy to edit the data and I don't

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,690
really don't say that about a lot of

00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:35,080
tools so hopefully that makes sense all

00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:36,220
right where are we up to cool so the

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,430
other thing that people want to move on

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:43,770
to something a little bit more advanced

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:51,510
which is the idea of event commands I

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:58,750
lost my speaker notes somehow nor are we

00:31:51,510 --> 00:32:04,420
piece-of-junk notes thank you

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:08,020
this is the problem with live demos at

00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,060
fullscreen I was talking to someone

00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,010
earlier about she was talking to me

00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,680
about event commands and she wants to be

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:17,140
able to restart a web server when it's

00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,720
down or something like that and I

00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,460
explained how it all works and this goes

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,660
back to your state change diagram where

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,520
you're going through hard and soft

00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,020
states and then well what if we get the

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,310
monitoring system to actually fix the

00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,390
problem for us and wouldn't that be

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:33,250
great and I you know and I said you know

00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,390
great here's how it works however you

00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,190
must keep in mind that you're really

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,830
just papering over the cracks you know

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,240
if if you've got a situation where you

00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,470
have to write a script to keep something

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,610
running you've really got another

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,410
problem that you actually need to fix

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,450
you shouldn't have a system that just

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,980
crashes all the time and you know are

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,350
great we just let the Mon system restart

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,640
and away we go fix that fix that fix the

00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,470
actual problem now you know

00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,970
some things are Java but you know search

00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:59,140
from that there was a Java joke you know

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,140
there are there are underlying problems

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,180
that adding I suppose the lesson to be

00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,480
learned as a consultant is that adding

00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:11,160
advanced features like event commands

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,160
often papers over the cracks of

00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,020
underlying problems all right so what

00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,300
else was there

00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,770
metrics I I'd like to encourage people

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,230
to make sure that when they're looking

00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,910
at metrics that they figure out what's

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,230
meaningful for the organization and

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,870
that's going to be different for

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,810
everything for everyone and then

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,240
gathering them and as discussed in other

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,740
talks averages of averages are totally

00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,830
meaningless so you get a pretty graph

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:44,770
and it looks great it's nice and smooth

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:47,560
but really is not particularly useful

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,770
for actual analysis so I would caution

00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,210
people about using metrics and making

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,180
sure that they didn't understand what

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:57,670
metrics are actually used for which ones

00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,160
are actually useful for a business the

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,680
second thing I would do is make sure

00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,900
that as a value-add we can enrich our

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,580
alerts one of the ways we're doing that

00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:09,040
with netbox is you know when you get an

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,960
alert about an actual thing very easily

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,480
be able to call back to the netbox api

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,580
with the custom variable and attach to

00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,880
the alert the actual rack that the

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:21,610
device is in I suppose in a cloud native

00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,620
world that's not relevant but you know

00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,240
these are the kind of real things that

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,040
we actually need to deal with which

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,870
where is it physically how does it work

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,350
enriching your alerts with something

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,909
that people can actually use is a way of

00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,370
creating that faith in the system that

00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:37,750
means oh I got you know an alert that

00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,760
was told to do something I know what to

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,470
do now and there's documentation in the

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,440
wiki there's a link to how it all works

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:47,280
all those kind of things the next thing

00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,380
I'd like to you know consider is when

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,730
any time an organization engages in a

00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,130
new project and they're trying to build

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,110
a new thing that monitoring itself is

00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,160
part of that project comes back to

00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,260
service delivery

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,300
all too often unfortunately we build new

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,950
projects we invest in infrastructure and

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,040
don't consider how we're actually going

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,840
to support it

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,730
and as a consultant you know at the

00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,080
highest levels we sort of have to sit

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,910
down with people that run project

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,860
management teams and say look you need

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,300
to actually take when a project manager

00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,540
is building something they need to have

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,860
a you know a plan for how this thing's

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,380
going to get supported how it's going to

00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,820
be monitored and managed and

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,260
unfortunately it often comes sort of you

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,390
know it's like the new guy turns up to

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,860
work he doesn't have a laptop because no

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,780
one told him that the IT guy that

00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,250
someone was going to turn up to work you

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,750
know and they're like oh look we've got

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,830
a whole new rack worth of gear here and

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,840
how do we actually monitor it what does

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,280
it even do and who cares and the vendors

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,470
like oh no it's fine you know it never

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,050
breaks never at all and you're like sure

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:44,810
right sir yeah it has to be integrated

00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:49,900
with your project plan some gotchas

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:52,280
things to look out for lazy stuff so

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,500
firewalls I put firewalls in here

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,510
because I've seen many projects come

00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,400
unstuck because they just can't actually

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,080
do the stuff they need to do a

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,210
distributed monetary systems really

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,800
important and very helpful for pretty

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,200
much getting around firewalls you can

00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,030
have checks executed over there and come

00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,290
back to here and that's really useful

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,850
because you only have to apply for a

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,700
firewall rule change once instead of

00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,960
many times and the other thing I'd point

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,180
out is that one reduced has become a

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,710
security point of weakness when a system

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,990
has access to everything else in the

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:23,600
building it becomes a target for you

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,160
know hostile people so you're gonna have

00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,450
a firewall there and you're gonna have

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,920
to figure out a way of managing that and

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,750
it really can slow the project right

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,340
down I've got customers where you know

00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,600
you have to apply and wait a week for a

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,880
firewall change and it goes through a

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,650
board and they approve it and you know

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,180
that much so it's a seven day turnaround

00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,400
time you get the port wrong another

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,290
seven days another seven days and you

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,730
need to spend months just getting the

00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,720
firewall rules right before you can even

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,150
monitor that thing that you've been

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,380
asked to monitor so I wouldn't

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,230
underestimate that it's it's an

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,910
important part of the deal so the other

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,260
the other four things are really things

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,810
you're going to come up against all the

00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,160
time you know you have people that say

00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,630
oh you know I've got this monetary

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,370
system and it's all falling apart at the

00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,350
seams but you know you can't touch it

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,270
and they'll do crazy political things to

00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:08,060
try and make sure you don't get to make

00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:10,160
a difference plenty of other proprietary

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,840
monetary systems my my approach with

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,080
other monetary systems and you know we

00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,310
have customers that will buy a system

00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,780
that comes with monitoring you know they

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,640
spend a million dollars on a project

00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,080
comes with a solution to let people

00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,360
entre and it's a you know well windows

00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,240
box with a custom GUI on it or a web

00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,960
interface or a SNMP miebs that you apply

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,520
for however it might be and so my

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,050
approach is to actually make sure that

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,090
those systems can integrate with a

00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,940
single master because what you don't

00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:39,230
want to have is a workflow where it's

00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,060
different for all the different teams

00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,310
you want to get to a point where you can

00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,740
consistently deliver service to the

00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:48,350
business and to do that you need to have

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,890
you know a amalgamation of different

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:54,140
systems into the one to the one thing

00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,550
and unfortunately you know we all have

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,360
the issue of lazy internet staff

00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,990
probably doesn't need a lot of

00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:04,160
explanation so I've got a few more tips

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:05,800
just to wrap up last five minutes the

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,690
other thing I'd suggest about

00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,580
integrating design and sustainability

00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:14,780
for our projects it seems like an odd

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:18,770
word to use but the systems that I think

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:21,140
have the most amount of I know maybe

00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:24,110
I'll put another way it's common in a

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,760
business where the general population

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,340
the people that we serve that are

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,080
getting the work done in a business come

00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,370
to get annoyed about a piece of software

00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,870
everyone has everyone knows a story

00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,640
about this where you know they're like

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,260
guards broken again you know this kind

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,050
of things broken and it's a failure of

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,880
an IT department to I think build better

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,340
monitoring around that to stay ahead of

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,890
those problems so the actual end users

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,320
don't notice them you know there's a

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,630
thing about load average on Linux at

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,190
some point you know a load average of

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,620
two doesn't matter when you've got 128

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,420
CPUs a load average of 129 matters

00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,310
because that's when something will

00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,990
actually someone's waiting no one's

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,160
waiting up and dump at that point so

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,500
when you're designing your monitoring

00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,300
you need to scale it to what's reality

00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,640
but also make sure that you stay ahead

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,290
of your users and that has to be

00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,510
soldered part of the design of a system

00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:14,540
and the sustainability you get out of

00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,840
that is that people come to trust you as

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,760
service providers much more the other

00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,650
thing I've noticed is that people are in

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,660
major incidents who's had a really big

00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,310
outage that they had to sit through you

00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,770
know really hit the fan get on a

00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,000
conference call for hours twelve hours

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,330
later you get off the phone you're

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,160
exhausted yeah

00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,440
I mean it happens and and and all

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,000
together too often at the end of the

00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,990
call when things are actually fixed

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,370
everyone just hangs the phone up and

00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,320
goes back to bed as quickly as they can

00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:43,260
but really what should happy happening

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,790
is hey you know how how do we monitor

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,250
this better so it doesn't happen again

00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:49,610
because as I said major outages of

00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:53,430
failures of monitoring themselves and

00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:55,140
then the other thing was was ticketing I

00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,680
already mentioned that so I think that's

00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,660
about it in terms of value I really am

00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:09,030
looking for to some questions so thanks

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:12,900
for thanks for listening we still have

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:16,740
some minutes for questions yeah oh you

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:19,110
spoke about value for business and and

00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,140
key value indicating things like have

00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:24,390
you ever taken monitoring to like an

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,700
executive level to to actually monitor

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:28,380
the business key value indicators and

00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,320
things like that or is yeah just down

00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,570
the line you know now we have we have a

00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,650
customer that provides business

00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:39,600
intelligence to to people and so much

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,370
like what Julian is doing with his

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,400
Prometheus stuff and his current

00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:46,050
customer they do reporting across the

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,240
whole business about how that works

00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,220
and so our monitoring system delivers

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,170
the checks to make sure they're meeting

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,820
those thresholds you know so they they

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,500
consume a whole bunch of data and do a

00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,030
whole bunch of processing on it but they

00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,920
still have checks to make sure a that

00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:01,140
those processes are working and B that

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,150
they're actually meeting the the values

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,160
that they have and then that you know

00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,270
they can get alerts from that so and

00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,790
that's just one example but there are

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:12,540
you know definitely have done that it

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:15,270
takes some time and it takes a really

00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,180
simple dashboard we use nag views with

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,790
big big boxes you know nothing

00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,320
complicated no text at all you should

00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:23,490
have here's a traffic light that says

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,200
how it's working if it's working or not

00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:29,610
and it has to be really simple

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,720
sorry manages but it really does you

00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,720
know the questions the questions

00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:38,430
you said that every outage is a failure

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,250
of monitoring

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:46,529
but how can monitoring prevent bugs or

00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:48,900
human errors that's a good question

00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:52,859
it really probably depends on how you

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:56,430
have your pipelines work down I think in

00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:59,250
terms of software bugs the only other

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:01,109
thing I'd say about that is building a

00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,349
robust system so that you can survive

00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:06,150
bugs and lightning strikes and you know

00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:09,000
all those kind of things is is the other

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,559
feedback loop that happens so it's a

00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,539
failure of monitoring to highlight the

00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,579
single points of failure might be the

00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,039
other way of putting that where you say

00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:19,049
well we're monitoring this thing but it

00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,180
just failed and there was nothing there

00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:22,890
was it was too super critical

00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,140
there was only one of them and now it's

00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,880
gone you know and you really just kind

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,769
of if that's if it's that important you

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,170
shouldn't be in that situation that's a

00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:33,150
design choice that you've made so I mean

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,559
it probably was a little bit of an

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,009
exaggeration but because you know

00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,839
obviously Sheen happens but you know

00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:42,690
when things are that important I would

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,910
suggest that you shouldn't be relying on

00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,440
someone to fix them machines are good at

00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,359
making sure that there's two of things

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,279
and that you can take over from them and

00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:52,079
all that sort of stuff and as you build

00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:53,880
a monetary system you'll discover single

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,200
points of failure and be able to feed

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,339
that back to your customer and say hey

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,589
look you know would you like to buy

00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:00,210
another one of those or hey I can spend

00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:02,430
two weeks building you a second one off

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,960
you know kind of monitor I can build

00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,250
tests into your software environment so

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,779
you have less bugs and you don't let

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,279
shitty code into production you know

00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:09,630
those kind of things so as I said it's

00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:11,970
actually a way of generating billable

00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,859
hours for a consultant that understands

00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,650
these things you need to have a team of

00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:26,549
people that can help you with that but

00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:28,970
it's an opportunity not a crisis another

00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:28,970
question

00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,690
so the question but put the question

00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:36,490
about the bugs what's very important is

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,579
that you also matter from the

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,960
development and to every environment and

00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:43,150
that you actually get traffic on those

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,829
environments like if we are partners

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,329
that are using your infrastructure then

00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:48,039
make sure they also use the test

00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:51,190
environment and that you are so many to

00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:53,829
return its like that that we catch a lot

00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,599
of bugs just by looking at all the

00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:57,910
testing environment is doing before we

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,480
put stuff in production that's a really

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,220
good point

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,780
so basically turning your monitoring on

00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,760
staging because it's just as important

00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,260
as production the alerting pattern can

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,420
be different and you should all by all

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,309
means have you know a separate workflow

00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,140
for alerts that you know these are the

00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:12,400
super critical things when someone

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,500
doesn't deal with this alert that

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,299
manager is getting out of bed whereas

00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,890
these are the ones where we can just see

00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:19,630
what's going on and if we're paying

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,740
attention we make a change we look at

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,630
that how it works

00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,220
the monetary system defines what's

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,900
healthy and we make sure that it's

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,910
healthy in staging before we roll it out

00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,619
so prevention is better than cure

00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:35,710
supposed to see is the summary of that

00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:39,190
one I couldn't agree more with your

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,930
thing about self-healing and event

00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,160
commands or event handlers because I

00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:45,250
think it's the best way to get a

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,650
read-only system to kill your main

00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,299
clusters it's yeah you don't even think

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,250
about the monitoring system being able

00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:55,950
of that and you may be lazy with your

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:58,809
configuration and then yeah it's the fan

00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:02,500
what I wanted to ask is you just said

00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:06,369
that your customers pay for building

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,710
custom plugins so you don't have you

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,349
aren't able to open-source them but

00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,020
isn't that a way to get other companies

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:16,089
to contribute to the community I

00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,250
personally know some some enterprises

00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:20,470
don't allow you to source it but

00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:23,740
couldn't that be a way of getting others

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:27,579
to get involved yeah absolutely I mean

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,779
and and it's a matter of negotiation

00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:30,520
you know you enter into an agreement

00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:32,619
with the customer and it's pages and

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,730
pages long and you have to at the end of

00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:35,230
the day sign it they're a huge company

00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,299
and they're gonna pay you a lot of money

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,880
to help them you have to kind of do what

00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:41,410
they say but and I think there's a bit

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,850
of a gray area with some of these thing

00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,590
we're talking about not a lot of work

00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,000
you're not building a whole thing that's

00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,040
going to be their core business so you

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,810
can negotiate that and contribute it

00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,330
back and I know I encourage our

00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:55,690
customers to to be you know good

00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:57,760
open-source citizens I I don't have a

00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:00,550
great answer for you though in terms of

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,740
you know yes it's a good thing but in

00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,870
terms of actually getting people to do

00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,810
it it's it's often quite fraught with

00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,910
you know danger III once you know the

00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,260
the CIO of this multi-billion dollar

00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,580
corporation came down and gave a

00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,200
presentation and we're all sitting in

00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,550
the room and she's like oh look how much

00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,170
open-source we use you know we're

00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,820
open-source friendly company we use all

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:20,860
this stuff and she had this huge

00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:22,000
presentation about how it was and then

00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,770
someone from the back of the room popped

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,630
up and said so how much do you

00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,930
contribute back to these Hawken ization

00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:31,990
she was like oh and thought about that

00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:33,640
zero was the answer so yes they download

00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,290
stuff off github but that doesn't make

00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,900
them an open-source could open source

00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:43,390
citizen you know that's a me fighting

00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:44,620
the fight okay then Dave and there was

00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,800
this question who is dealing with

00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,810
ServiceNow from you in the past you know

00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,780
I can tell you you can say yourselves

00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:55,810
now guy that it's possible to create and

00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,660
valid alerting into ServiceNow in five

00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:00,160
days with creating tickets attached to a

00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,880
department administrator and write

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:19,060
system five days still seems like a lot

00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:21,250
of effort two hours yeah it's possibly

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,660
one of those empire building things you

00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,980
know people give you an answer that's

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,290
not really the correct one because

00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,470
they're trying to get you to go away but

00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:32,260
we'll see okay when it's time thank you

00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:35,130
thank you for being here here's a little

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:39,130
present for you so thanks

00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:48,989
[Applause]
