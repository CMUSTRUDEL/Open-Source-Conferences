[Music]

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:20,000
thank you very much does it work does it

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
work it works

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,359
voila

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,410
yeah hello welcome to the last tag today

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,380
in this room we have one hour 15 minutes

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,059
before the talk of the book rider starts

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,850
but they need some time to rearrange the

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,719
the room so I'm hurrying up and try my

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,960
best to be not in time just to introduce

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,289
myself what I do in my name is is parent

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,210
I'm working in that ways and I sing uh

00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,860
my responsibilities that I'm doing most

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,350
of the strategy and partnership things

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,120
together with Blair Blair him and apart

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,860
from that I'm mainly taking care that

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,949
the others love each other more than

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,000
they hate each other you can reach me on

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:06,320
my email or Twitter if you want to and

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,460
yeah that's that's probably probably it

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,770
introduction to I think as somebody and

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,790
it's not a bad thing has no idea what I

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,790
sing guys know how it works

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,740
fair enough fair enough

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,520
how it works sometimes I don't know it

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:26,700
either but let's say I know it what I

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,460
singer is my singer is a monitoring

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,619
framework so the icinga stack consists

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,560
out of a lot of tools and addons

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,479
regarding to monitoring automation is a

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,509
big part of us say it comes them

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,549
directly into the game and also the

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,049
support we have for configuring

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,759
configuration management tools so log

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,250
management metrics and analyzes these

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,549
are these are the things we are taking

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,130
care of in that stack we have a couple

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,840
of products who live there and just to

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,020
give you an example this their single

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,329
core this is our main component in their

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,579
single stack taking care of checks and

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,310
executing plug-ins or gathering

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,700
monitoring data and send it out to

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,619
matrix databases for instance we have a

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,300
web configuration tool named by singer

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:14,030
director which is a big part also from

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,709
the demo today

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,330
it's our central point for

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,220
configurational for a singer for

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,260
integrating different data sources and

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,500
also interact with different other

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,319
components attached to icinga we have

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,720
broad support for everything which is in

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,700
the elastic stack world which also means

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,880
that we work very well with Greylock and

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,130
in everything in that so last year we

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,769
focused a lot of that talk regarding how

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,019
we can play with these log files so ship

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,459
matrix to elastic get information out of

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,040
the log stash output and stuff like that

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,870
so it's all well documented even the

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,819
slides are online later so I don't think

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,019
that you write it down you can find all

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,040
the information of course in the

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:56,780
documentation and another thing is the

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,150
the graphite for a singer which we

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,280
introduced last year is a it's a short

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,690
way to get some graphics directly into

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,870
our singer without leaving to another

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:10,610
third-party performance interface like

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,519
Ravana for instance so from day one we

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,720
took care a lot of being very good and

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,989
degradable and all these tools out there

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,940
because we never had the approach to to

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,950
say we will solve all the problems and

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,540
reinvent the wheel in every corner so

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,640
our goal from the beginning was that we

00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,859
with all the popular tools out there and

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,120
usually people if they are not coming

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:31,820
from a Greenfield which usually

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,440
enterprises not doing they have some of

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,880
this and would like to integrate icinga

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,829
at some point in that stack and

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,660
therefore it was very important that we

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,920
have all these integrations some are

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,450
better them some are not so good but

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,579
there are many many more and also there

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,650
are lot of integrations out there which

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,269
are not built bass means it's an open

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,340
source project still people do a lot of

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:53,660
stuff for us for instance lag

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,600
integration and stuff like there it's

00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:01,400
out there but that's that's an important

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,720
part ecosystem which is my typical slide

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,819
I have every year because I would like

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,930
to encourage you to let me know who is

00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:11,569
using icinga we have a couple of

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,209
customers and brands we know that they

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:18,350
are using I singer these are new it's

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:21,799
like the BBC they have a very large high

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:25,130
singer instance we have we know that

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,290
some big Russian TV broadcasters using

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,580
icinga the problem is that we don't

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:33,620
officially no it means people talk to us

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,300
but we are not allowed to use the logo I

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,590
think every project every open-source

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,270
product has that thing that sometimes

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,430
they would like to say hey this company

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,800
whatever they use our product but we are

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,330
not allowed to say it so again like

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,040
every and if you are in the talk for a

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,960
couple of years you know that please let

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,580
us know so of course we would like to

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,490
use your logo on our website it will

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,440
help us promoting it we usually ask for

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,650
permission to do so sometimes we just do

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,210
it and figure out what somebody cares

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,650
but yeah let us know so if you're using

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,970
icinga if you're happy with it even if

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,710
you don't give anybody money if you just

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,930
download it from github that's that's

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,640
absolutely ok but we would love to have

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,380
your company what are you doing with a

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,850
singer to learn about it and even

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,500
perhaps at some point we would like to

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,630
get in touch with you if we have an I

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,460
singer camp near you that you come over

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,740
give a talk and talk about your stuff

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,870
and really never underestimate how

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,760
interesting your stuff is for others so

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,200
often go to somebody hey you can talk

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,180
about your environment yeah but it's not

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,490
so interesting it's super lame but

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,290
usually it's very interesting for others

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,780
even if you think your own system is not

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,180
super cool for others it's perhaps give

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,760
some brand new idea so yeah please share

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,120
that with us we have a growing partner

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Network so pretty much two three years

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,910
ago we figured out that we cannot do it

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,830
everything from Germany so we have

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,870
partners all over the worlds there are

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,360
some empty spots I guess they're also

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,160
people up here but we don't have

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,770
partners right now which is missing that

00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,510
we have a partner in India now again I'm

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,980
also super happy that some of the

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,990
partners are here like Dave coming from

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,380
Australia I don't know where he is is he

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,060
here

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,060
ok Dave from Australia

00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,199
and then also change from shadows off

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:20,149
from from Atlanta is coming over so

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,669
thank you for being here our partner

00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,080
from Brazil is not here but therefore we

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,569
decided to fly there for the next

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,360
carnival to see how it's going on in Rio

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,029
so we have an we have an excuse to go

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,009
there and here if you interested in

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:35,330
partner with us it would be very good if

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,459
you're not in Germany so if you is

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,139
somewhere else from and would be

00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:42,379
interested in in bringing I singer to

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:46,490
two people it would be great so let us

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:48,649
know please some some lab tricks what is

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,689
really cool that we we increase our

00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:52,039
traffic on the website very much means

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,569
that the only reason I show you that

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,330
graph because if the graph would go down

00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:58,399
I would not show this slide it wouldn't

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,309
make any sense for me that's a little

00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,499
bit self happiness so at some point

00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:05,059
we've we don't know who using our system

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:07,159
we have some metrics where we can see

00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:09,139
where people load packages from that is

00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:10,909
what we have but it's really cool to see

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,369
that that it looks like we have a

00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,069
momentum the last year and especially

00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,569
this year that that we have an

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,029
increasing amount of people coming and

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:22,909
our website working with our products it

00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,379
even know them it's it's just great that

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,059
the graph is going up and or down that's

00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:30,439
the only message of the graph ok it's

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:34,279
going up so that's cool community stuff

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,839
we did some I singer meetups so we would

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,819
try to do more in that field so we had a

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,229
couple of them in in Berlin Salzburg in

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,599
India in Surrey

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,899
we would love to have more so if you

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,749
have an idea to start a local meetup

00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,099
group so please let us know we try to

00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:50,389
support you so we send you like a care

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,789
package with sure it's thicker it's

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,069
puddled servers whatever so we send it

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,949
over make it easier for you to bootstrap

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,360
a meet-up and also of course bring you

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:02,929
on the website that other peoples can

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,759
find you we have we plan to invest next

00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:07,969
year also to grow our community around

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,249
the globe that we also visit more places

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:12,829
and that also ends up that we plan to do

00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:14,059
a lot of icinga camps so the next one if

00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:17,959
somebody is interested in going to

00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:19,729
Israel on the 7th of December which

00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,099
tel-aviv should be an amazing city I've

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,569
never been there but we go there with

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,050
six people now because we think it is a

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,810
cool idea

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,150
to go there so you can still grab a

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,830
ticket for Tel Aviv also Berlin has

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,839
already announced on the 14th of March

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,250
and there will be some camping washing

00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,110
next year together will shut us off we

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,169
don't know yet when it will be perhaps

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,599
in March at some point we would go and

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,070
be there again also we're working with

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,920
our Swedish partners we have something

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,040
in Stockholm again and yeah let's see

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,329
wherever somebody wants us to be we try

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,120
to go there talking about the products

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:58,579
of a little bit what we have done what

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,870
are we working on so talking about I

00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:03,769
singer to a lot of happened so I'm

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,420
decided for a couple of years that I

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,870
don't talk about the changelog all the

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,060
time

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,070
because it's it's way too much but what

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,250
people do I just would like to show you

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,620
a little bit what what happened so we

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,269
have I have three fields I just picked

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,300
out of the last I singer two releases

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:22,370
which i think is interesting so it's

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,079
like stability and the syndics

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,940
highlighting with this stuff perhaps not

00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,470
everybody especially if you're looking

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,380
for syndics I like a director it looks

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,420
different it's for hardcore vim users

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,920
but since Michael put a lot of effort

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,740
into it I think it's worth it to mention

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,610
it here and also namespaces which is a

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,209
cool feature so what it is regarding

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:46,970
stability we invested a lot of time in

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:48,410
redoing our our connection process where

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,870
we interact with all these clients so

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,570
people with a very large amount of

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,520
agents I think in shunt formula we'll

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,980
talk about that tomorrow they had the

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,800
problem that the icinga core always has

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,149
to to spawn you processes and and shut

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,290
it down so we have their problem and

00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,270
then we implemented a thread pool

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,550
handling this which has an overall

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,390
improvement of all the interacting with

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,920
external agents api and stuff like that

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,570
also preventing the checks date changes

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,959
after reset was a big issue for some

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,760
people i think if you have no idea what

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,490
this is about then it's a problem you

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,329
never had so just forget about it for

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,440
the others it will be very helpful

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,620
syntax highlighting if you're working in

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,839
the config files and use whim you can do

00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,699
this and to take this in a practical

00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,920
example i try to explain you what the

00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,810
namespaces feature are

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,490
so perhaps this sounds familiar to

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,160
somebody looks familiar to somebody of

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,500
you like like and I sing a configuration

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,750
can look like if you work with different

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,640
environments for example so if you have

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,410
a production staging development system

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,480
that you have to figure out in your

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,250
configuration which password would

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,810
previously defined perhaps and constants

00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,150
conf you have to use at some point in

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,650
the configuration and it is could be a

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,330
little tricky so if you have in a lot of

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,010
areas and that configuration you need to

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,550
do that you have to keep in mind all the

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,450
time which password do I use here and

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,910
version to the ten we introduced

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,610
namespaces and the concept itself is

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,950
pretty simple so you create some

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,800
namespaces where you can define your

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,300
passwords so for example reaction stage

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,339
in development you have different

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,770
passwords for that environment like a

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,060
single of monitoring of or no LOF which

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,220
is usually in the development

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,480
environment if it comes to the

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,370
architecture point of view from the

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,170
machines so we have these individual

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,240
namespaces and then the configuration at

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,029
a later point you can just address these

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,450
namespaces right so you can say I'm now

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:43,190
working in the production space using

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,560
mysql password my sequel password etc

00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,330
etc and also on the staging setup so you

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,070
can use it in one file multiple files of

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,680
course it works in the in the whole

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,570
environment so if something is you deal

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,610
with and in working with these kind of

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,740
very ops this is very helpful to clean

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,960
up your configuration and to make sure

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,870
that you know exactly which were able

00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,180
you you're working about I also would

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,589
like to say that there is a lot of stuff

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,600
how I singer works so the internal stuff

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,010
how the lexer parser the configuration

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,390
stuff everything works of our singer

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,870
there's a lot of improvement in the

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,310
documentation so Michael and the other

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,040
student invested a lot of work to

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,430
explain all this because still I singer

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,959
too is out there for six years I guess

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,060
even all the things happen in there was

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,010
a lot of magic even for a lot of us we

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,350
didn't know what happened exactly so it

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,480
it it worked some point of course the

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,220
developers knew what happens but the

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,010
rest of us who was like yes something

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,810
happens and it makes it more easy if

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,820
you're into it if you're dealing with

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,190
problems to understand how I sing our

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,440
work so how it parses the configuration

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,850
how it activates objects and all that

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,410
stuff to understand perhaps

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,949
for different reasons you run into an

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,180
issue or not so definitely if you're if

00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:58,009
you're into it and if you're interested

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,060
in more technical content you should

00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:05,870
invest some time and look into it I

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:08,209
think a director I think later this week

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,310
Tomas will release or perhaps now nobody

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:13,759
knows exactly we'll release a new

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:17,269
version of icinga director version 1.6

00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:20,870
he already released 1.5 to 2 but one six

00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:25,490
is coming this week and just to see who

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:30,560
is using icinga director is it 50

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:34,279
percent no it is how much is it no idea

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,360
ok whatever ok I say the 95 percent of

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,310
you using our singer director there are

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,310
some cool new features in a singer

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,959
director so first of all you have now

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,100
the direct support into the air singer

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,779
director that you can use multiple

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,579
instances so you can work against

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,029
multiple databases and can just switch

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,949
them into interface all the the whole

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,089
health check process where you can see

00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:58,069
what happening to a regular if the

00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,810
demons are running everything is more

00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:01,939
popularly on the web interface I'll show

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:04,279
you later and also Thomas and we have a

00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:05,360
configuration basket which is pretty

00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,089
cool

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,550
so explaining the instances stuff so you

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:13,939
can see here that it's a little bit

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,649
shaky here and here you directly can see

00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,509
in which environment you're working on

00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,130
so you can directly this is like a click

00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:21,980
box you can select another environment

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,839
and push your configuration to whatever

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,069
database you want to makes it much

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
easier that you don't have to

00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,550
reconfigure the database in the backend

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,589
so if you are working in a setup where

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,500
you dealing with different staging

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,630
production system it's super easy to

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,100
deal with all of them using icinga

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,310
director because it's super easy to

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,439
switch over talking about the health

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,600
check even in this example you see it

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:46,519
immediately on the on the top if

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,350
something is not going on or the last

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,870
deployment felt we make it at much more

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,029
prominent space where you can see if

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,250
something is not going well and directly

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,079
go deep into it and see something not

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,519
working to see immediately because often

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,319
people run into the deployment it does

00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,939
not work and they figure out at a data

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,740
point when they already start the

00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:05,990
debugging

00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,070
and the basket example I think Thomas

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,050
you have what happens in the demo as

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,630
well right

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,920
what basket is that you can all the

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,230
configuration you have a nice singer

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,399
director except the host or service

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,050
objects itself but the whole

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,570
configuration part means template

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,760
service templates everything you can now

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,830
export them and import it to another

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,020
system so you can take your whole

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,550
configuration out all the templates or

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,270
your apply rules everything you can

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,730
configure it

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,380
you can snapshot them you can also

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,300
immediately see in the template what

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,550
happened what object chains and take the

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,250
whole configuration to another system it

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:43,760
also will be the foundation for our

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,770
upcoming stick that we will ship more

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,260
and more of basic configuration to the

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,029
users so our plan is that if you get I

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,540
sing a director or you get everything

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:55,070
ship with it to monitor a typical IT

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,779
environment whatever typical IT

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,080
environment is that we have to figure

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,910
out at a later point but let's say the

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,220
plan is that we can cover a typical

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,010
environment but this gives us the the

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,170
ability to to export and import the data

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,029
and play around with it and even hop

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,700
from one single director instance to

00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:16,010
another you can see that we have Houston

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,080
blades how many they are how many data

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,370
fields also data sources so everything

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,750
which is configured in director you can

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:24,320
just carried from one instance to

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,980
another all right but also Thomas will

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,440
take part of the demo later we'll show

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,430
you how that works

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,900
talking about new products we have

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,380
add-ons somebody perhaps out of it I

00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,040
don't know

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:43,070
it's like x.509 management tool for

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,750
certificates what it is that a lot of

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,060
people have the problem that they have

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,500
no idea what certificate is going on in

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,750
their company if they are valid if they

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,779
are running against an authority and

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,490
therefore we created a module which

00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,200
makes a little bit easier where you can

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,520
scan Network ranges and immediately see

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,029
how your certificate infrastructure

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,029
works and how that works I show you know

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:11,000
hopefully all right so we have our our

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,589
demo I singer instance I hope you can

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,429
read it but what's written here is not

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,850
so important so I installed the module

00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,770
enable

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,589
but right now there are no certificate

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:25,579
installed which I do now

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,820
okay hold on so first thing I do is I

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,460
import the CR bundle so the local

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,679
certificates which then I see what

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,289
certificates we have so where we have an

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,470
an or chain against it and that what I

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:42,980
can do is in the module configuration

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:47,450
for that x.509 you can create different

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,190
jobs right I use a public network IP

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,200
network because it's the only one I was

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,940
able to scan or probably I don't have

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,190
bad feeling if we can scan it from here

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,799
so you can have multiple jobs with

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,559
various c address and can configure them

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:11,179
and scan them and then we just use

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:13,309
icinga CLI and just do it so we go back

00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,440
to the module and then we are going over

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,000
all the certificates we can find in that

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:23,179
environment also multiple chops of

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,820
course and then I see that right so you

00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:29,030
can see if they are trusted or not if

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,159
the chain is valid the certificate

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:38,120
authority how long it's valid and also

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:44,140
the certificate usage of them whom

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,140
steamers up que llevan yeah could be

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:58,970
well it's a virtual machine of my wife

00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:00,710
she has no idea honestly sorry now she

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,799
has an idea of a lot of things but she

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,120
has no idea about her certificate which

00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,190
is the reason she handed over the

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,200
management to me which ended up in an

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,419
invalid certificate that's awesome great

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,340
good to see thank you thanks for

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,659
bringing it up so that's how monitoring

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,760
should work you show them or somebody

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:23,270
tells you your infrastructure scrap and

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,190
then you cannot fix it later on ok so

00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,350
just give you an impression I would not

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,380
go to into deep dive because we I think

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,960
then we're running out of time

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,840
it will be many on get up next week

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,270
perhaps this week if that's the thing

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,070
for you you need yeah just install the

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,780
module import your certificate

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,180
authorities and then just scan you

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,880
network devices also in health check

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,920
using the icinga CLI will help you to to

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,870
manage and I also know that some check

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,700
HDPE checks of course can also validate

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,070
those certificates but it's even harder

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,850
going out to the plugin output and see

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,250
what's going on

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,960
it's just a better overview like always

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,670
in an open system they are not only one

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,070
way to do it there are a couple of them

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,170
but this is a pretty easy way in a large

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:12,360
environment filter them and and and go

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:12,360
through that certificates alright

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:21,860
support for we sphere that's a new thing

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:24,980
released today today means ten minutes

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,190
ago or something so today is really

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:35,090
today right what the vSphere model is

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:38,360
its model for vSphere surprise it gives

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:40,880
you a very easy way to to go into a

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,870
vSphere VM environment who's using

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,450
VMware vSphere that's there's a target

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:51,770
group Thomas looks looks promising

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,800
where you can go into it and and analyze

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,340
your vSphere infrastructure this is very

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,300
heavily sponsored by DM tech so taking

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,210
the chance to us thank you

00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,150
and then I'm handing over to Thomas who

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:09,110
is still typing which makes me nervous

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:12,020
but on the other hand I'm used to it so

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:25,910
Thomas go ahead it's your turn to do the

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:28,000
demo for the new hot stuff 30 minutes

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,000
ago

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:56,090
okay okay

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:57,919
live demo so I have just a minute so I

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,320
skipped a part waste installation so on

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,960
I all right now have a nice thing about

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,559
isolation it's pretty empty I downloaded

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,010
and installed the I think web - let me

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,960
show you

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:31,990
vSphere DB module it's it's this one

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:36,260
and there is one release running in

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:47,270
production environment since I hear at

00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:49,659
least half a year I'm working a very

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,659
often

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:56,810
that's nice because you can develop

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,270
really with a lot of machines and a lot

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,040
of data the problem is that you have to

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,920
build what the customer wants and making

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,290
it them generic and usable for everybody

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:14,210
is a lot of production and so I finished

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:16,700
it this night so it's a simple module it

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,130
has no database schema I've created the

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,890
database connection I have a database

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,640
and create a new schema so now I'm a

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,650
couple of new tabs appear and I can see

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,140
that there is no daemon running or

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:36,080
that's that's a problem so let's let's

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:49,940
start it no let me switch it here so you

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:57,200
can hello mmm I think vSphere and let's

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:58,340
have a look at the status ok database

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,980
connection has been established it's

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,500
running it's up it's talking to the

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,060
watchdog of system D so if it is its

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,620
internal state machine changes state

00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,180
like it has lost a connection to the

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,810
database or so on so you can immediately

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,530
see in the in the system D status that's

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:17,330
what state it is in

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:19,940
and right now here it's well it's not so

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,750
exciting there's one daemon running so

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:27,260
let's go on and configure a V Center I

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:33,190
have some of them and I do not have the

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:33,190
certificate of this one and um

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:43,950
okay let's go back to the demon and it's

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,720
already yeah I see it started in this

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,360
already the demon is synchronizing and

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,310
importing objects and so on so that's

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,470
fine let's go to the to the V sent and

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:58,260
now we see here that we have a just one

00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,810
V Center this is this is just an e6 I

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,270
host so this is very boring just I

00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,450
wanted to show you how quickly you can

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:09,900
you can get starters there's only one

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:15,390
compute cluster boring there's only one

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:17,010
host and well we have let's close this

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,200
one there are a lot of other columns

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:23,060
like you can of course have a look and

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:28,140
say okay elasticsearch is burning cpu

00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:32,910
here you see let me close this one yeah

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:37,260
it has like two CPUs and is using all of

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:40,790
them so this is what modern heaps of

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:46,860
software does using your resources

00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:48,810
it's it has one disk it's well used but

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,640
it only uses a part of its data store

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:52,260
and oh there are bad things there are

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,630
some very old snapshots this is

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,970
something that's usually shouldn't be

00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,590
there who is running VMware knows that

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,910
this this is a problem there are some

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:07,440
hoops for different backup tools like if

00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:09,630
you have rearranged or we more what's

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,120
the IBM spectrum if I'm not wrong then

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,920
you if they put in their annotations

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,620
then you see some details related to the

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,690
backups its if the guest utilities are

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,290
running it shows their guests partitions

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:25,350
and the disk usage you see the hardware

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,810
you see eventually some events oh it has

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:31,320
been powered off and on in August so you

00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,630
can see we started the daemon and we

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,150
imported the whole history the vCenter

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,010
itself had but it does it very smooth so

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,500
even in a very large class there's not a

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:46,530
problem

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:49,440
and yeah that's a lot more like for

00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:52,350
example here I can sort my memory use

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,570
Chapra CPU usage without ever viewed a

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,000
lot of more many more columns you can

00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:00,419
see well show me the active memory or

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,009
memory used on the whole store yeah and

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:07,470
so on mmm but I have I prepared another

00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:10,019
database for you is a it's kind of a

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,740
production database anonymize so this is

00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:18,000
this is real stuff and let's go back to

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:21,570
our dashboard and switch database on

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,340
let's go to the demo database okay the

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,710
database is outdated so let's apply a

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,309
schema migration that's fine

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,169
the demon right now tries to is showing

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,659
failures it's you see there's another

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:35,190
demon it's try to connect to another

00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,690
resent its timing out right now

00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,210
it's not it's not able to reach that one

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,639
and it will then simulate a stop and

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,279
keep just one of them running it

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:46,409
realized that I switched database

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:51,690
disconnected reconnected and what's

00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:53,610
working with new demons so maybe they

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,159
could be more machineries to handle but

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,200
already right now in version 1.0 it's

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,679
pretty it's pretty stable and these with

00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,690
a lot of error conditions and here you

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,860
see more day that this is like I

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:13,860
configured multiple V CentOS and there

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:16,889
is yeah let me example I see that our

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,590
new close to 5000 horse with 100 servers

00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:22,860
and to have terahertz of CPU capacity

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:27,539
and so on we have 132 terabyte RAM here

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:32,519
and yeah then you can drill deeper and

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:34,340
so on let's have a look at the maybe

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:43,409
virtual machines

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:46,590
come on oh and let's look at the CPU

00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:52,429
usage oh this is a nice one

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:57,659
this is this is one virtual machine with

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:59,159
112 CPU cores using 122 jjigae hurts

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:02,850
right now or at the last time I

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,169
synchronized it so this is you know data

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,220
warehouse and so on this is Friday

00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:09,750
evening they start a lot of work using

00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,759
all the power they have they have just

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,350
one server but this visualize so one

00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,169
server running on one physical host

00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,700
utilized and it's using all the

00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:20,399
resources on Friday evening and Monday

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:25,590
morning it does nothing there are other

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:28,230
systems like I cannot see it let's

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,879
switch back to the default columns so we

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:34,679
can zoom in a little bit

00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:38,490
oh it C D yeah it's a nice one this one

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,440
has 16 cores and is burning oil course

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,649
so if you log in on these are five

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,250
similar systems they're using 100% CPU

00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:48,240
and every CPU all the time but that's

00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:56,330
the totem it should be like that so

00:29:48,240 --> 00:30:02,129
that's fine yeah so here's a softer go

00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:03,360
then here at the video machines also

00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:06,299
have an overview of all the snapshots

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,850
and you can see show me the machine with

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:12,119
most snapshots or with the old snapshot

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:17,190
or from 2016 it should be or should be

00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:21,899
fixed I can also have a look at

00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,940
oh sorry all the I have 25,000 these

00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:25,110
partitions

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,639
collected from the yes system so now

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,309
let's have a look huts let's look for

00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:32,490
Windows systems like C column what is

00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:34,559
pouring I think okay there's more or

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,960
let's add in one more column which I'm

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,279
interested in the usage and I have the

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,200
fullest one let's keep icinga I only

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,970
want to see our as a reason ice

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:52,649
Dakka Dakka let's search for and only

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:53,309
production so we have okay this one is

00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:53,730
pretty close

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,690
let's

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,080
let's remove production oh that's a bad

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,169
one

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,880
this one has at least pretty full let's

00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:03,389
have a look at the machine it's still

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,740
alive

00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:11,730
yeah so more or less that's it oh that's

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,220
more data stores are very nice mm you

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,909
have all the data stores and you see

00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,880
like you have 500 of them and I don't

00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:23,309
know let's pick a random one it's a bad

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,149
one this one here you see all the

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:30,360
elevator machines the the currents users

00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:32,370
you see this one got 50 jigs and is

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,460
using half of its disk on on the data

00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,830
source just a little little part the

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,950
chorus here have a meaning with for

00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:48,870
example there are mmm there could be

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:52,679
systems using only no layer warning this

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:55,620
is a nice one eventually yeah there's a

00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,850
good example here we have one data store

00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,460
with 12 terabytes

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,960
but the DeVitto machine has more than 12

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,970
terabytes this is that's why this is

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,860
yellow this is very dangerous if your

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,480
operating system starts use that space

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,340
this doesn't mean that the disk has to

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,620
be full just as he moved enough data

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:19,049
round then you have no more storage

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,450
physical one your operating system

00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:28,620
believes that there is space and then

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:31,289
your then you have a lot of fun it's yes

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:35,460
oh oh there's more

00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:38,730
there are also events like your example

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,590
you see this one event collector running

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,139
very smoothly so it's on the first

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,380
connection it connects to your V Center

00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:48,179
and fetches every two seconds just one

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,870
thousand events it creates you SOAP API

00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:55,260
an event collector and fetches just

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:57,120
small parts and fetches ever seen your

00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,260
recent ahead so that new it gets from

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,559
the beginning a little bit of history

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,289
and and then it streams life but very

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,940
smooth on only every 2 seconds right now

00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,880
hot corrodes maybe in a future version

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,080
we can

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,630
customize this but this is fast enough

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,520
and I'm listening to those events so

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,800
when for example there is a powerup or

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,420
power down this also immediately changes

00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,200
the state of the video machine itself

00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,790
and so if you get a some kind of an

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,030
event it has an immediate effect on the

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,470
state of the object of the object itself

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:29,470
here for example let's have a look at

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:35,340
your vent types like hot migrations they

00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:39,010
have a lot of time in October 21 and

00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:43,840
3000 migrations that's a lot then let's

00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:45,970
have a look at the failed migrations Wow

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,700
they hold it nothing and here we have on

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,700
one Sunday 2000 faith migrations

00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:56,380
automation they rolled out Alex this

00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,560
configuration to many many hosts and

00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:02,290
this generated a lot of load and the

00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:05,140
cluster one compute last off started to

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,910
explodes and we centered and started to

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,190
move machines around made everything

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,780
even worse and this was an attempt to

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,610
manually fix its emptiness in the

00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,110
history time if you can then drill down

00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:19,270
and you see really that someone started

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,800
and it was moving from here to here

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:28,360
these are the hosts you can jump to the

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:29,649
hosts here you see all the details more

00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,450
or less that's that's it right now you

00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,490
can of course switch the table view for

00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:36,250
the events you can you can filtered

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:38,220
events per cluster and here's nothing

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,990
for example let's go to the migrations

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,590
hot migrations there are some of them

00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:46,149
let's go to the data warehouse only

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,710
migrations here nothing in your days

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,970
they do no migrations in the data

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,909
warehouse and so on so that's more or

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,370
less what you what you get right now

00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:59,530
this has been released it works I

00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:02,620
disabled quite some features and the

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,780
next four weeks I'm finally allowed to

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,550
work intensively again on this one so

00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,500
there are more features to come as for

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,720
example we have deep integration with

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,180
the monitoring module if I have already

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,800
an implementation mm value in the

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,810
monitoring module list you see your host

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,790
it has a problem and directly on the

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,550
host there you see them let me show the

00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:25,109
information here Monsieur habits

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:29,440
if you go to a random video machine

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:30,520
it's shows like that many of emotion

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,050
attempts took place during the last

00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,240
seven days so in the monitoring module

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,890
you get an alarm have a look at the host

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,079
the host has a lot of load or it's low

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,910
or whatever and then immediately there

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,400
you get context and you will see oh

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,099
that's a migration going on or there was

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,500
a migration during the last I don't know

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:50,680
three hours or so so the first question

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,240
always did they move my machine and then

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,329
you're going to look around ask

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,770
questions some tickets and this creates

00:35:55,329 --> 00:36:00,460
a little bit more transparency

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:06,040
transparency sorry yeah this is more ice

00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:10,180
alarms or similar mmm yes that's it so

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:13,450
let's that's our module we want of

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,369
course also have checks in icinga to

00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,319
that monitors this environment is right

00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:19,599
now we have a front-end but we want we

00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:24,119
want to get alarms and more so let's

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:30,069
switch to the singer director and I

00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:32,920
prepare the baskets just to keep time so

00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:36,280
basket is burnt explain to you the idea

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,170
I created the basket with a lot of with

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,000
a check command to host templates one

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,530
service template to server sets to

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,839
import source as a single and two data

00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,880
fields the nice thing is you create the

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,950
basket choose those objects and you can

00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,230
then like for example say I want to

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:55,599
restore the basket to another another

00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:58,660
database and you can see oh this one is

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,049
new this one is new it has no video

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:04,000
machine template this one has a

00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:05,470
difference like okay the database

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,349
resource for the input source change and

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,290
so on so it shows you a preview and you

00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:14,290
can then download the baskets restore

00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:16,660
its whatever and you can do is also on

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:18,609
July the basket export this Jason and

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,460
you can import X for this from Mozilla

00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:23,619
list baskets and great snatch this all

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,690
the time so when you often when you

00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,099
change your import rules or synchros a

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,500
lot of there's a lot of clicking going

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:32,200
on and then you forget what you did do

00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,060
your work make a snapshot and then you

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:40,660
can always restore it or

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:43,690
have a look at that if mmm we have one

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,210
customer it's sponsored a lot of this

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:51,810
are they here I'm not sure whether we

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,810
allowed to mention them okay thank you

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:58,420
it's if you want to be mentioned let me

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:04,750
know I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:07,450
it's thank you anyway so let's hurry up

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,650
I had the basket I could import it as

00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,200
what's the idea but right now I'm ready

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:15,100
and I have and I think environment Ares

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,820
I hope at least there's no host no it's

00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,550
empty

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:21,610
above you there's nothing here cool go

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,770
back to the director and my basket had

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,110
this host import sauce

00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:29,620
just imagine the idea you get the basket

00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:35,050
import it trigger run veto machines

00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:41,790
taken import one what oh sorry ah I did

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:46,920
a little hex to wipe my objects and

00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:53,490
change this one again uh-huh yes also

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:59,410
fix and let's trigger the lon

00:38:53,490 --> 00:39:05,380
okay once again seems a little bit more

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:13,780
got is sink to rego 1/2 for new host

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:16,870
school this takes a little more time she

00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,900
saw few thousands visual machines and it

00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:23,560
should yeah finished ok that's nice

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,530
well we already so what I also created

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,460
was like they got the host templates we

00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:32,110
have hosts video host meter machine with

00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,140
different configurations and what you

00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:37,810
also have is it's hard to see here

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,670
service templates we have we have

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,740
service sets these are apply rules and

00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:45,550
they apply or the hostname contains and

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,410
so on so nice we already there are some

00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:54,369
changes the

00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:55,690
like go and now I'm deploying them to

00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:57,119
another container here on my host I

00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,319
think it's ready that's cool

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,319
the plumbing was fine at the single size

00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:03,789
I'm running with okay it's a simple demo

00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:05,589
setup but you get the idea

00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:11,099
four dozen services for dozen hosts and

00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:12,940
if you switch to the technical overview

00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,410
there's something wrong with my service

00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,799
checks but it's for a configuration

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,660
error when the hosts are fine cool and

00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:23,500
yeah I could figure the input source to

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:28,180
ping localhost so but now it's it will

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:31,809
get warm in a few minutes it's running

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,369
well and that's that's it so I for the

00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:35,530
release I had to disable the integration

00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:37,900
here but we have a integration right now

00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,210
where you you see the VM details here

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,430
you see if the vector machine is fine in

00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,349
the vCenter if it's powered on usually

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,000
it should be but if it's not powered on

00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:48,160
then you see the host is down and the VM

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,230
is powered off okay you you had to do

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,970
not gonna have to search that's a

00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,400
solution and then you can click here and

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,289
get even more context and one little

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,859
detail is shown immediately here that's

00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:01,539
a migration it's going on or started

00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:06,579
Urich the last I don't know how many

00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:08,460
hours and I guess I'll give it back to

00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:11,579
you so that's it

00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,579
thank you

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:20,860
[Applause]

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,010
the Thomas is doing all these last time

00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,690
releases we hate him for that the

00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,059
problem is we love him more than we hate

00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,530
him otherwise he would some see two

00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:45,609
flashlights at night when we take the

00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:47,880
car and drive over him but like I said

00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:51,160
we love you more

00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,010
all right thanks Thomas I'm moving

00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,280
forward with icinga DB you remember that

00:41:54,010 --> 00:42:00,609
I have light slide until two weeks ago I

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:05,680
still had it in my presentation so what

00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:09,069
is I singer DB I single DB is that yeah

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,740
okay now it works I sing it B is it

00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:15,849
should be our replacement for I do so I

00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:18,490
do is pretty much still the old Nagios n

00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:21,640
do schema enhanced in some ways but

00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,859
pretty much it's still the same and our

00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,809
idea which is going our mind for years

00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:28,359
now is that we have to replace it

00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:30,369
because of a couple of reasons so first

00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,410
of all one is performance

00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,900
the problem is have with the current

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,430
database is that most of the traffic

00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,470
most of the data we write to the

00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:40,630
database is something we immediately

00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,940
delete an update like five minutes later

00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,650
so all the volatile monitoring data like

00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,980
okay okay okay all the status

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:49,990
information so we it needs a lot of time

00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,579
to write this down especially imagine if

00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,650
you have like five hundred thousand 1

00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:55,510
million service checks like writing this

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,640
to the databases at someone reaches some

00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,849
limits and that's that's a big problem

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,190
that we probably consume a lot of energy

00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:05,799
and a lot of compute power to should

00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,539
just create yeah data which will be

00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:09,670
wasted away a couple of minutes later

00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:11,200
another thing is that we and a lot of

00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,140
aspects have to deal with the old

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,059
database schema which gives us some

00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,670
limitations so one thing is for example

00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:20,109
reporting getting SLA reports out of the

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,270
old database schema of course it's

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:25,119
possible but it's tricky because we have

00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:27,250
to wrap all that I sing a state history

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,619
table another thing for example with

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,749
some people heavily use custom

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:33,640
variables could be a problem if we have

00:43:31,749 --> 00:43:35,950
a large set up with a lot of custom

00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,799
variables and then for example have fine

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,329
great authorization in icing a web based

00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:43,779
on different variables it could be very

00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:46,809
tricky to then go in a single web and

00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:50,200
have the result in a speed that you

00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:53,140
expect from a monitoring system and that

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,440
is one of the reasons we just started to

00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:59,289
do it knew what how does I singly be

00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,650
work so the idea is simple

00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:04,749
so we have a Redis feature in icinga so

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:07,210
it writes all the data even volatile or

00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:10,869
even data to be stored into a Redis

00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:12,430
database and then we have an external

00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:16,809
process named icing a DB which is

00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:18,490
written and go which decides which data

00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:20,200
needs to be persisted in the database

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:21,849
for example state changes need to be

00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,349
persisted because you would like to do

00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,410
reporting later on you would like to see

00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:28,029
what state changes but even all the

00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,160
volatile data means the current status

00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:32,740
we didn't change will be kept in the

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,900
Redis and so I sing a web gathers data

00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,670
from both system where right now I sing

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,559
a web only deals with the database in

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,839
the future I singer web will talk to

00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,369
Redis and to the database depending on

00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:44,799
which data it will need so if you go

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:46,180
imagine on the state history and would

00:44:44,799 --> 00:44:47,799
like to see what's going on of course we

00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,440
have to query the database but for the

00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:52,269
current state result for instance we can

00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,619
just use Redis and it gives us the

00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:55,619
possibility even in larger environments

00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,779
to have a quick result and I would like

00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:04,720
to show your demo I I've decided to not

00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:06,309
show you demo of this because I think

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,249
you have seen a Redis in the process

00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:11,410
list and you have seen a database so

00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:14,170
what you will see is you will get a new

00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,839
monitoring module and this is something

00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,640
I would like to show you in a very early

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:27,339
stage I also have to say in a very good

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:30,450
but early stage all right ok my VPN is

00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:30,450
broken now that's good

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:43,520
okay give me a second

00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:48,619
how are you so still okay okay just

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:58,490
asking you know I guess so

00:45:48,619 --> 00:46:03,770
I guess so yeah well yeah that's that's

00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:10,660
what I'm yeah but now it's like okay for

00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:13,430
squid viscosity goddamnit

00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,320
yeah that's because I need the Wi-Fi for

00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,349
a tricky demo later on this is not so

00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,349
good

00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:24,550
okay I'm try to hurry

00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:49,910
where is it where is it this is it ah

00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:55,520
come on guys okay if you can't do it you

00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:58,849
can do it okay so perhaps my OpenVPN is

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:08,300
coming back no it's gone but it's not

00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:12,220
back okay we have time we have time no

00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,220
we don't have time no we don't yeah okay

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,599
[Music]

00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:32,450
Jesus huh yeah that's that could be I

00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:35,970
don't know

00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:52,140
yeah I have a Wi-Fi connection I to make

00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:57,420
sure and adhere now capable whatever

00:47:52,140 --> 00:48:14,070
Google you know it worked before

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:18,630
Keep Calm it will work that we've a

00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:19,420
system I used my hotspot connection I

00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:22,530
guess

00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,530
[Music]

00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,150
okay what we do we switch over to the

00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:29,979
other demo which was planned for the end

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,920
and then I connect to the other Network

00:48:29,979 --> 00:48:35,589
and try this again okay okay we're

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,049
moving forward because otherwise I think

00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:40,390
you will run away at some point I come

00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:42,579
to the demo later which okay I could go

00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,059
I say later and then skip it because we

00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:47,079
don't have it

00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:47,759
that's no no no I have it so okay say

00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,219
relax

00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:54,309
I planned it with some playground which

00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:57,059
is the reason I have these Wi-Fi thing

00:48:54,309 --> 00:49:00,789
which is not working right now anyway

00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:03,009
some playground because also this year a

00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:05,799
lot of things way around like IOT and

00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:08,619
home automation and an open HP and MQTT

00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:10,269
and stuff like that I thought it would

00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:12,519
be perhaps cool to show you what you can

00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:16,509
do with our singer or with an open API

00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:19,269
to work with your management system how

00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:21,430
so who of you is like in the smart home

00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:23,729
area for example which currently at home

00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,930
nothing works because you're not there

00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:32,199
which usually happens when I leave my

00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:33,549
home nothing works so the idea here that

00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,779
we can play a little bit around with our

00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:40,630
singer and some automation stuff with

00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:43,299
telegram and with my iwatch and this is

00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,829
what I like to demo with you and the

00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:46,989
idea that is I play around with two

00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:48,579
components so it's a singer which

00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:50,380
telegram which is the messaging what I

00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:53,829
use here could be something else

00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:56,259
and node-red who knows node-red who is

00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:58,660
heard about it and not many people than

00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:00,099
this if you're not heard about it this

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,039
will be mind-blowing for you I promise

00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:07,779
because it's really cool so what not

00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:12,430
rate is no Redis is a product by IBM the

00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:15,339
company red head you know they have

00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,289
these these tool for years it's it's a

00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:18,819
flow based programming tool it's open

00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:21,640
source reachable and anode read but

00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:23,170
please don't use the Wi-Fi run out what

00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,049
it is this a flow press programming

00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:28,719
built for IOT but it works pretty much

00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:33,719
for every open API whatever system you

00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,719
can have and it's really really cool so

00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:41,860
and I try to show you if it works let's

00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:43,420
see no bread could be installed in a

00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,590
docker container or just as the package

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,330
is npm no chase application and what no

00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:51,430
read is is that gives you the

00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,770
possibility to just have various inputs

00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:58,770
various outputs and then api to all the

00:50:53,770 --> 00:51:03,040
systems out there so it's pretty much

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:07,870
stopping that is not good because I lost

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:11,980
my Wi-Fi connection now oh my god it it

00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:13,780
worked it worked but I'll try I think

00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,050
that Maya demo will not work then

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:22,840
because I have whatever reason the Wi-Fi

00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:25,360
ok it's not another lucky day

00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,670
so what node-red is you have different

00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,590
inputs and outputs so you can for

00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:32,610
example what we did in this example is

00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:34,990
that we don't have a Wi-Fi connection we

00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,390
created just a simple in check which is

00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,940
the timestamp object like every 5 second

00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:41,910
pause the icinga api with the HTTP

00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:45,310
request and gets out the information

00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:47,470
searches with it switch box for specific

00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,150
patterns in that way then going through

00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,490
a throttle object the throttle object

00:51:49,150 --> 00:52:00,040
gives you the possibility to just go

00:51:51,490 --> 00:52:01,960
after check a specific pattern then go

00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,170
through it and then execute from that

00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,610
spot execute a telegram question to your

00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:11,220
telegram board for example what I do

00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:11,220
here ok I have to fix it I'm sorry

00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,890
[Laughter]

00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:30,200
is some cotton with too warm it's

00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,800
probably okay well whatever

00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,630
if I fail it's it's our life they move

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:40,630
does not work so the idea of that

00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:48,380
workflow is grab I singer it's a pain

00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:50,990
it's a pain okay there stop sorry I

00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,840
don't know where the stops always vacuum

00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,130
cleaner I have no idea

00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,140
perhaps it's a name for somebody's

00:52:55,130 --> 00:53:01,520
torrent machine killing all the traffic

00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:03,530
I I can imagine I okay whatever I don't

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,800
know why doesn't work so the ideas

00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,390
gather go to our singer query every five

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,580
seconds of the API if there's a critical

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,290
machine and then otherwise send out a

00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,390
telecom question to the bot and say how

00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,640
would you like to deal with it

00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:18,740
information okay so wife is broken

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,070
give me another is it okay if I use five

00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:28,070
minutes extra okay because I would like

00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:31,090
to get it done I think I cannot do the

00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:33,549
other thing but this thing should work

00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:39,099
connected okay

00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:42,130
oh my god okay I think I explained it

00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:45,699
four times what it does it queries it

00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:50,249
looks error hey say what's going on so

00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:55,449
we try it so I send a host which take I

00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:58,689
from a host list taking whatever

00:53:55,449 --> 00:54:00,339
automation demo and submit a check

00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:04,079
result to bringing it to down because

00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:04,079
it's the only thing which works here

00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:21,740
and then if you go to that workflow

00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:24,050
which perhaps I use the service Oh hold

00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:29,150
on I my mistake because I'm checking it

00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:30,980
on services I have the checkpoint Cheney

00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:37,220
event location check which I use for

00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:57,520
this and it's a critical another number

00:54:37,220 --> 00:55:05,030
oh my god

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:13,400
yeah why I'm soft but why what what is

00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:15,609
wrong no it worked all the time oh god

00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,609
damn it

00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:31,670
okay okay okay you you can go I I will

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:36,910
continue I will get it it's not a

00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:36,910
problem at all I will accept one success

00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,599
but for whatever reason

00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:58,680
no it worked it worked no no no no no no

00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:58,680
I don't trust you because it's it worked

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:20,350
yes what no usually not perhaps thinking

00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:22,600
okay we take another one hold on I wake

00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:28,620
that's that's what happens if you do a

00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:39,640
live demo it sometimes does not work but

00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:41,620
it is how it is not good okay for

00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,510
whatever reason it doesn't work okay

00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,090
what what was the idea what should

00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:48,970
happen I explained it what should happen

00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:51,490
is what should happen is that I have a

00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:53,470
question problem critical would you like

00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,570
to acknowledge yes or no in depending on

00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,090
my decision instantly with telegram I'm

00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,860
using the singer API and acknowledged

00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:03,640
the problem or escalated to another

00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:05,020
contact this was the plan since you're

00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,370
not seeing anything you see that it's

00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:13,060
not working which is very frustrating

00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:14,980
but yeah and the second idea which I

00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:19,000
would like to show you was doing the

00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:20,530
same with home kid automation which I'm

00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,680
sure it will not work because I'm not

00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:26,020
connected to the network anymore so the

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,790
idea is what we do here is we have an N

00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,860
home kid adapter which is named

00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:31,150
acknowledgement so what you can do is

00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,770
here you talk to your watch or your

00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,530
iPhone and say turn acknowledgement on

00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,420
and then also using the icinga api and

00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,250
work with the acknowledgments or

00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,100
escalate a problem I don't know if it

00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:46,090
makes sense but this is a very cool

00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,410
feature you can do again I cannot show

00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:49,810
you because it's not working but

00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:54,310
hopefully my VPN is working now and I

00:57:49,810 --> 00:58:01,840
can show you I sing Gary B and if not

00:57:54,310 --> 00:58:05,920
I don't know what happens then Alice

00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:11,020
somehow now I'm turning on Simone so

00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:19,420
it's a la okay I go to the icinga

00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:21,790
rivulets I tried very hard okay with a

00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,650
new icinga DP which the icinga DB itself

00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,480
the component is running but it's not

00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:28,150
worth demo it comes in your monitoring

00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,710
module the reason is that because I told

00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,970
you before the monitoring data is

00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,670
gathered from different systems like

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:36,070
it's gathered from the Redis for the

00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:38,230
status tat and it's gathered from the my

00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:40,300
Sequoia Postgres database getting or the

00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:41,920
other information so the new monitoring

00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,860
model at some point will replace the old

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,800
monitoring module and I just would like

00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,920
to give you some overview how the new

00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,110
monitoring module will look like so we

00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,760
go to the hosts perspective or we go to

00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:57,940
the service perspective in that example

00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,290
so the new service you cannot read this

00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,210
but you cannot think you can read the

00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,340
host name I hope so

00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,870
immediately on the services you get also

00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,170
on every service kit now an impression

00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:10,150
what's going on on the host so the data

00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,620
owes in a large environment gives you a

00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,750
better overview what's going on with the

00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:17,230
system and also what happened and if we

00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:19,680
go in to a district for example which is

00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:25,000
the preview of the new monitoring module

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:27,310
is that first of all the action bars are

00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,170
on the top perhaps there's a modal

00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:31,030
coming on where it's another window I'm

00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:34,450
coming in there but also the last three

00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:37,090
events immediately in there so also it's

00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:39,130
carrying the the status history that you

00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,390
have everything which is required which

00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,880
is important for the system immediately

00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:45,070
in your view and can see better also if

00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,230
you have a longer output you can you can

00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:49,780
do this way which makes it a little bit

00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:53,800
more compact and easily to find also

00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:55,510
comments and down times we also

00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:58,420
rearrange the performance data and

00:59:55,510 --> 01:00:00,130
graphics here and also how you can deal

00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,580
with feature commands like activating

01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,870
passive checks and all that stuff I

01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:06,760
think if you have a comparison to the

01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,970
old one which I will give you that you

01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,940
see that it's not just

01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,870
some CSS and give you some other service

01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,270
overview

01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:17,210
it's very unstructured in some way and a

01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,890
lot of information and I think the the

01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,260
new monetary model makes it much cleaner

01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:23,780
to go through the data so you see

01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,930
everything the the service groups and

01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:28,910
host groups are more styled like texts

01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,650
that you can work with them of course

01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,150
you can go through here and see the

01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,400
services connected and also immediately

01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:36,050
on that services you see what's going on

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,690
on the parent host with the other

01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:41,450
service object states which gives you

01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:45,650
much much easier approach to deal with

01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:47,870
the data in that example we have a

01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:51,340
couple of comments we had some some

01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:53,150
informations happens here and also

01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,620
integrated graphing and also the

01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:57,860
performance data we get out of the

01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,420
service check result all right so this

01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:03,440
pretty much will be the new monitoring

01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:06,140
module it's not yet released like the

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,000
vSphere module we are working on it I

01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,950
would say it's coming soon because soon

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,700
is a very flexible expression of a time

01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:16,070
frame but it's not like it's not like

01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,290
dummy data it's it's the real eye singer

01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:20,090
to be working there getting the data out

01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:23,330
of there icinga Redis and and putting in

01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:26,330
the systems and our target is that first

01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:27,560
of all that it's it's superfast even if

01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:31,280
the environments we are targeting with

01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:34,280
with millions of service checks on top

01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,410
of it and on top of the new database

01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,830
model reporting will be so it gives us

01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:41,780
much better accessibility to the data

01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,280
and even in a large environment gives

01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,440
you a quick overview what's going on how

01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,910
your service availability is in seconds

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:52,790
even if you have millions of checks so

01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:55,670
this is the current module yeah I think

01:01:52,790 --> 01:02:00,250
I don't know when we put it on when we

01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:04,580
put it there two weeks kind of two weeks

01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:07,610
then christmas is coming yeah later

01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,170
yeah anyway so we seen something by the

01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,510
end of the year let's let's say this

01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,190
that you can play around with it at some

01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,480
point I think we have it we have some

01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:16,280
time where the old monitoring module

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,350
still works you can you can install it

01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,970
by side because then at some point you

01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:21,200
have to decide going the new or the old

01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:23,119
way because

01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,250
installing both monitoring modulus perps

01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,720
will be tricky also because of the links

01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:30,440
of all the other modules pointing back

01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,470
to the icinga D be monitoring model also

01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:35,569
we'll see a lot of CI improvements we

01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:38,990
have done we will try to bring to the

01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:43,220
rest of the icinga interface as well ok

01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:49,460
so there's still no telegram post which

01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:51,559
myself I have to go to a summary again

01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:53,630
I'm super sorry that my team the day

01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:57,770
demo was awesome really I could walk to

01:02:53,630 --> 01:03:03,109
my watch and say acknowledge but it it's

01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:05,270
fantastic but I I failed and it's very

01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:08,260
frustrating you can see it but in my

01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:08,260
inner-self I hate me

01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:14,930
ok what we have done so we to summarize

01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:18,079
up because then ok a little bit over

01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:19,940
time we put a lot of I put a lot of love

01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,770
in the in the basic stuff in the icinga

01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,740
- in director and all that in all that

01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:26,359
components I sing a review which I'm

01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,700
really happy because we worked a lot

01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:30,480
thank you very much - to the development

01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:35,760
team they did an amazing work

01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,760
[Applause]

01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,150
and it's really a big thing for us as

01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:43,280
well that we bring this to the door

01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,430
because this is a big thing for four

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,660
years now I think a director will be

01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,820
released this week

01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:53,270
I don't know tomorrow the day after

01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:55,369
tomorrow whatever the vSphere model so I

01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:57,410
think pretty much 40 50 percent of the

01:03:55,369 --> 01:04:00,290
people here using vSphere you can use it

01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:02,090
today I was able to install it and

01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,859
getting running with some help this is

01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:06,500
help you don't need so you can get it to

01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:09,890
run very easily so play around with it

01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:12,250
it's here the certificate model will be

01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:13,940
available next week on github

01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:19,400
controlling a singer with you watch

01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:24,410
makes absolutely no sense but it should

01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:29,240
be a lot of fun anyway thank you very

01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:31,850
much enjoy your evening so I'm happy to

01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,770
say that we now have one last round here

01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,950
with the book authors and then we meet

01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:40,310
in the lobby at 6:45 sorry Daniel if I

01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:42,500
take your part thanks for coming over

01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,940
give us some feedback I try to get the

01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:48,080
demo I've been running for tomorrow so

01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:50,690
if somebody would talk to my watch I can

01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,000
show you that it works it frustrates me

01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:54,410
you will see me stopping later on thank

01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,530
you very much have a nice evening thank

01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:56,530
