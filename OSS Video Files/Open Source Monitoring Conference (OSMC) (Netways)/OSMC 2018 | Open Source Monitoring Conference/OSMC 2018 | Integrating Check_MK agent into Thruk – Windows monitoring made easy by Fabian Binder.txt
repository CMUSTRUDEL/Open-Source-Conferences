Description: 
	Did you ever get a headache configuring Windows monitoring using NSClient++? We did, too! While using the Check_MK Windows agent we were impressed by the plethora of checks that had already been implemented there. With the goal in our minds to create a fast and easy-to-use Windows monitoring solution, we set out to integrate the Check_MK agent into Thruk and tap into it’s capabilities. Combining them even allows for fully automatic service discovery!
