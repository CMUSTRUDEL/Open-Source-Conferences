Title: OSMC 2018 | Make IT monitoring ready for cloud-native systems by Rodrigue Chakode
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Modern cloud-nativeinfrastructures consist of large number of components components to monitor (hardware and software). You have to manage hundreds to thousands of components (e.g. container-based microservices). Effective monitoring in such an environment is complex and challenging, notably to avoid false alerts and to concentrate your efforts on incidents that matter. Monitoring should not be just a matter of getting raw metrics through your favorite monitoring tool (e.g. Prometheus) to draw nice graphs in Grafana. It’s important that, for each incident, you be able to assess (quickly?) how it really impacts your business. Hence you need to rely on incidents aggregation, along with dashboards and notification systems that take into account the real impact of every incident on your business services. In other words, you should for example avoid to fire a critical alert while a failed container does not critically impact your business services (e.g. a service you provide to your end-users). Assessing the real impact of each incident allows operations staffs to be able to prioritize issues based on those that have higher impacts on services.

That’s where this talk comes into play. The intent is to discuss advanced aggregation and visualization capabilities aiming at helping operations staffs to deal with monitoring with focus on business applications. We’ll also introduce RealOpInsight [1], an open source business application dashboard management tool that works on top of various existing monitoring systems, including, Nagios/Icinga and derived, Zabbix, and even more. We’ll finish by showing some examples and demo based on RealOpInsight and Icinga [2].

Among others, RealOpInsight provides the following features:

Service Impact & Root Cause Analysis
Business Service Management Map & Advanced Event Correlation
Multiple, Distributed & Heterogeneous Data Sources
Graphical Configuration Manager
Cross Operating Systems
Multi-Tenant/Service Provider Ready

[Music]

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,960
thank you to be there last night we

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:28,080
drink lots of beer so thank you for the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:31,769
organizers so I hope that we are wake up

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
so we today we want to discuss clown

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,920
Nazis and the challenges that you raised

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,230
regarding IT monitoring and also try to

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,020
figure out what we are today regarding

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,070
monitoring in cognitive environment so

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,440
to the agenda I will they already

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,190
introduced but I will give you a brief

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,780
about me we describe our native try to

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,629
describe this cognitive and the

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,300
challenges for IT monitoring and also

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,430
present here open side project what we

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,129
try to propose for cognitive entering

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,159
also for traditional monitoring if you

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,119
are lucky we have some demo so we're

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,799
crossing earth also our vpg in computer

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,220
science in the area of distributed

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
system and also cloud system I finished

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,150
my PhD in 2012

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm software architect in an automotive

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,770
company I'm not there for the disk

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,520
company but it is a German company you

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,490
may know but I mean friends about 8

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,710
years of friendship fourpence was

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,369
monitoring of 7 project that I

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:44,299
contribute this IDs to project but also

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:48,450
project that I contribute to so

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,720
chronically what is according to CN CF

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,630
trauma chief bring a new paradigm with

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,049
micro service architecture you have

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,880
continuous service and everything in

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,890
terms of infrastructure is distributed

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:08,819
on orchestrate I did Helen what is

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:11,340
introduced is that cognitive embrace

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,920
failures this is important regarding

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,170
traditional IT in traditional IT we

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,069
already try to avoid that fill you up

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,319
okay if our server go down we are we are

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,410
not happy and we will have a call from

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,290
our boss saying what is wrong but here

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,700
the new president say probably the

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,530
problem is not the fact that you can

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,870
have failures but you should address

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,010
videos you should design your

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,040
application you should design a

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,410
mentoring take into account that thing

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,000
can fail and film will likely fail in

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,680
traditional ad we try to reverse

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,989
failures but from fair so it is

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,590
something that we win lost to try avoid

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,650
failures

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,620
that is why chronically tried to address

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,420
for this there are four traits

00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,420
resiliency meaning that if in fact we

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,630
can try to recover a little meaning that

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,480
we can actively change things in

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,100
production changing our development to

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,519
be able to address he knows if you have

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,260
a book we shall have a part Crickley to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,910
be able to address these values we

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,739
should not have a system ministers will

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,500
try to make some patch with the

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,680
developer tomorrow to fix to fix things

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,070
so everything should we do in a way such

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,530
that radius can be addressed easily

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,280
Burke everything usual arises is written

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,140
on a genuine you have operability this

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,500
is another important things a

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,810
probabilities is not about a monetary

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,940
guy saying okay I'm looking at the

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,359
system everything's okay no it is about

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,730
the application itself they try to say

00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:51,329
okay I think that something may go wrong

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,750
so I mean for example in grocery shut

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:57,600
down without any intervention so I for

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,470
some reason maybe for Network reason I

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,640
start having or request for my request

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,220
so I mean that I'm not really ready to

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,319
answer requests so I will gracefully

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,660
shut down this is the application itself

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,519
therefore thing is the observability

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,039
this is about mentoring we give more

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,080
detail later but here it is about your

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,120
resilience your agility us or

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,570
probability and you need to consider

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,730
this to have a state two of you

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,510
of how our artist monitoring is

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:36,660
operating on a new application so this

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:40,110
is a good book from Crewe native if you

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,310
have time you can read it it is good so

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:47,760
I bought observability you have two men

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,800
aspect head reporting important it is

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,320
not a pro and a standard probe that's

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,850
saying okay I make it ping and

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,050
everything is up no it is the

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,180
application itself

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,560
that's say I party to some internal

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,350
matrix say I'm okay I'm up I'm walking

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,660
this is about headman enjoy I'm okay

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,400
telemetry okay I have some data a

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,430
typically you can have some pen or

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,160
patents they read so request number of

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,110
requests I receive number of Aurora

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,230
produce and then the duration of each

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,830
request or maybe an average duration so

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:25,650
this is some kind of aspect main aspect

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:30,510
you have regarding observability fork

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:33,540
relative application so the question is

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,870
are we ready to make monitoring in this

00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,380
kind of environment today we have I

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,590
think other eggs okay with static

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,370
configuration we have configuration that

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:50,400
need to check this server and another

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,840
one but if the server fail maybe when

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,340
you have in micro service environment

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,350
will use kubernetes here who no one yeah

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,830
for communities for example you have

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,590
micro service when the service go down

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,600
Michael a country go down when the new

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,120
one is started it is not the new name

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,750
the same name see new name how you

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,050
addressed is with static monitoring you

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,670
say my mentor is sure ping a server

00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:24,690
named toto but if the today the toe will

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:27,060
pop up with 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,520
it's not the same thing external

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,020
problems currently

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,790
pranati say usual each application if

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,700
company application should provide

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:41,450
information about each state itself not

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,450
external tools

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:48,989
but you have observability tool for

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,389
cognitive namely parameters is - or

00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:55,319
maybe trusting like we see we saw we

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:59,539
were yesterday but this from a point of

00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,909
view of button tools to have roll matrix

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:05,009
for lots of component not easily to

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:10,229
understand I'm not easily - you need to

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:14,849
aggregate to have a good inside so we

00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:17,249
did reinvent ourselves we need to be to

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:23,129
make some dynamic discovery of what we

00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:27,179
monitor also fun thing to be able to

00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:29,689
address the dynami the volatility that

00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:33,389
we have in a cloud as ephemeral remain

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:36,029
so our tool need to go in this way that

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,059
is why today he looked inside that I

00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:41,849
start initially to work with that give

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:45,509
as I think off whatever what today we we

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:49,259
also go on this track what is Europe

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:53,219
inside it is a high level tool which aim

00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:56,339
to federate and give you an inside view

00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,799
of on your IT environment typically you

00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:02,579
want to have a business view or what is

00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:04,169
operating good or not you can collect

00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,360
data from various sources you have

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:11,809
combinators you are a singer know

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:20,039
everyone here use I think yeah Nigel's

00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:21,899
yeah sentry oh yeah yeah sorry okay you

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,019
see draft is foreign you want it for

00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,239
them to have if I'm monitoring that is

00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,159
we've provide this tool as full open

00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:32,240
source free open source software that

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,479
you can have detailed in this website

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,349
sorry

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:40,139
so the devil take it you are they - what

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:43,259
they give you your bill dashboard easily

00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:45,720
they give you a brief overview of what

00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,870
you are in which environment you can

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,579
have if you like ok yeah I have an item

00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,129
coming from kubernetes

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,879
this one coming from zabbix this one

00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,640
from icinga

00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,100
this

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,890
one also for kubernetes a namespace from

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,710
communities but I can also have a view

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,290
that correct information from various

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:09,520
sources so when our Italian will see in

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:11,680
the demo hopefully - when we have a view

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,780
that great information from commodities

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,870
from icinga from whenever we want for

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:22,120
today we have the big sauces cervixes I

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:25,570
sing acapella T's from Google Club and

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,600
also have you also have reports over

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,400
time you have him here you have some

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,110
kind of contour about the number of

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,330
problem you have this is correct what

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:39,040
will represent no more from here

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,470
everything is good for this platform for

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,740
crib system and you also have for this

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,110
period of time a peach heart that's

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,530
saying okay I have quite enough time

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:54,250
problem or every time everything is okay

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,900
so have a good sleep nice or you can

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,790
also have a even if it's there that's

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,330
saying for this platform you are for

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,760
them you have a detail for what happen

00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:05,740
you can go so this is the overview of

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,140
the tactical overview but you can go

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,120
deeper if you click on this item you

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,540
will have anything like this in this

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,630
thing

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,850
it is this approach you have a tree

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,360
based organization of dependency

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,220
organization of what your service a

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,720
hundred service named system that depend

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:28,420
of cubes enos enos had some pot and this

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,760
pot depend of this container this one

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,740
this one is from four continents so you

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,410
organize it like that automatically you

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,390
have a free view you have a map and also

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,380
it comes over here while you can have a

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,020
detail about what is happening and also

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:48,430
a static about for each peach are about

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:52,720
the number of Oliver item this one which

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,530
are row monitoring data that data

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,710
robontour editor you have a study bodies

00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:02,260
so that is about historic unnecessary

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:06,190
analysis analytics you can export it in

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,080
Rafa now we use Ghana yeah I can plug it

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:11,440
in with possible square

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,170
sources which is new in graph ana 55.3 i

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,500
signals to have this graph in graph on a

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,000
so you can have some sliders window so

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,660
you have all these graphing graphing

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,100
this if Li is it to integrate you have

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,470
binary our sources okay

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,260
so get up you have sausage to a minor

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,960
you are the images your virtual machines

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,100
images we've access graphical

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:38,410
configuration and Ike CLI but graphical

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,640
interfaces some time codes and waffle

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:45,640
you would already have a CLI to access

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,130
to a service everything is based on a

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,560
tree integration you can automatically

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,990
discovery a discover service in your

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,080
mentoring system everything is fully

00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:02,800
documented so now you can try to have

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:14,410
some demo we have chase okay let me

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:16,440
bring these windows and this virtual

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,440
machine

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:36,500
okay we will start by this this is the

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,930
window sash oh but this is the real

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,850
system it's just look at here our little

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,740
pad from free access to the Border

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:50,360
Patrol as I say if I click here up when

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:56,210
I say you have detail about what you

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,790
organized you can put the mouse of some

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,340
detail you have here everything here is

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,500
a dynamic if i refresh the console and

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,770
if you change your subsidy chain here

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,670
thing nothing change but if i refresh

00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:17,150
will not move see nothing but we show

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:19,070
next demo whole thing change you can go

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:23,980
back from the executive view it is the

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:29,950
view where you have a Wi-Fi connection

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:32,330
which is your second to have a hopefully

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:35,330
okay we go back here it's a product

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,390
connect collectivity so you can click on

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,100
the program and then rightly jump

00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,050
through the service when you are from

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,620
them here is the I think I monitoring

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:50,180
here we have to show you what is it here

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:52,880
a have a I think deployment I have just

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:58,910
one server that is what you are what you

00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,100
are here only company but can I see what

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,160
I want I can delete some time I can

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,430
create a complex view from whatever you

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,620
have here the program you have detail

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:17,120
you have a statistic about from them and

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:20,360
also you cannot sit back for Pareto you

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,540
stay there reference of no permit like

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,440
this same thing for this part for this

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,360
part I can show you it is a company in

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,670
coming from a DCP a Google cloud

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,380
platform are accommodated instance here

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:38,810
with this service I have this workload

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:44,870
service that's where

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:47,900
is coming from I have this day so this

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:50,780
is a basic overview of what you can do

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:59,360
about graph aa integration a half here

00:14:50,780 --> 00:15:02,120
if you I can show you can show you I

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:10,160
have some scripted dashboard grand for a

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:13,700
dashboard so if I log in you can see

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,370
here the dashboard with some variable

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,950
with one variable that help you select

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:24,260
the view you want to visualize some of

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,220
them here have no point yeah for this

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,500
1/2 point

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,590
so this a venturi so you can see

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:38,000
everything like we showed it before

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:40,820
readies and for icinga so you can change

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,190
for for each graph on our windows you

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,390
can change the windows to see what

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:53,420
happened you have details oh so now we

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:57,140
have to have a live demo to show how to

00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:04,150
configure thing a via a local diploma

00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:07,390
new manager machine we try to log in so

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:11,900
you have to perfuse sources

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:14,540
yes so 0 I have a integration with I

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,480
said I guess but it is everything that

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,880
is my juice negatives like I seen guys

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,570
and few so that's why we have different

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:27,230
kind of sources so see you can have

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:30,380
manage energy in pandora FMS rubik's my

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:33,950
girls my Geocities everything similar

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,160
like Nagios z NOx and you can also add

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:41,510
other tools so for my sauce room have

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:48,649
Nagios and it live stitches listing of

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:51,800
our network our network in this port

00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:57,220
and this is just some information to

00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:00,499
have this thing but here I will try to

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,149
make a quick view this is imported

00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:10,279
viewing partition I select it I take

00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:14,029
zero but up this doesn't work but the

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:18,169
problem is that it's because as locally

00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:20,809
I didn't I I think I will try to have it

00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:28,390
you need access to my remote icinga

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:28,390
instance now I will start again and then

00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:38,750
OOP I go now I have my view something I

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,360
make quickly but I can design me point

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:45,980
by point so I can say okay let's show

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:50,720
you I can say sorry I can add upon

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:55,460
create I can add a new font and say this

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:59,840
is an AC service for this I say it is

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:03,200
service I want to select a so zero

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:07,120
I see everything is Linux server sources

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:13,490
and then I want to take some some item

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:19,909
take this one then I will save what I

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:25,580
have safe now I'm not crazy editing but

00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:28,570
I can see what this is display select it

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,830
armor graph this is the phone app and

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:36,289
then I can refresh now only did I

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,799
retrieve and then have my view update

00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:43,419
but what I show shown you before you

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:48,260
have in view highlight a high level view

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:54,289
to do this we use a concept of view

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:57,080
assignment so here a half user i've user

00:18:54,289 --> 00:19:00,710
data create before but easy to create

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,940
you have a user and then you say the

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,820
kind of

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:09,559
view the user can have then we manage

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:12,500
view I will select the user and apply

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:27,500
the review I just create and then log

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:28,370
out and login again ask the user no okay

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,950
artists you

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,470
I just have one half one view

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:38,210
everything's up but what you can see

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:42,799
here is that you don't have historic you

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:49,309
don't have the even feet this is because

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:54,019
you have different kind of you are

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:55,000
logging in as administrator and say my

00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:59,419
nature sir

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,419
this user and then say we update the

00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:07,360
user and say this user can have it

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:16,580
complete you update it and then logout

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:18,649
work again then have more detail so this

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,840
is some kind of cop see custom district

00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:24,049
and we can say okay my boss don't want

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,559
to see all the detail I have you just

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:30,649
want to see the I liver view the can say

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,200
okay each this operator all should have

00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:36,799
access to these do this or everything

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:46,059
that is every Vivian is customizable so

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:46,059
now we continue by having more example

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:03,200
okay similarly I will show you from the

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,100
weeks have some sauce here which is a

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,370
weak sauce zabi

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,040
no this is kubernetes sauces fuckability

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,680
sauce you just have an integration with

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,470
the proxy interface of kubernetes this

00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,820
is the interface that allow you to

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,580
connect to your communities cluster

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,880
through a local foxy so here I will try

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:28,310
to start the proxy from a DCP if I make

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:31,160
you see TX to show our cluster here I'm

00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:38,920
a cluster which is my PCP trustor you

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:43,940
can say cube City and it's your proxy

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:46,640
this will start a local foxy but with

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,810
River connection to my cluster then I

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:54,320
can go back this is okay now now I try

00:21:50,810 --> 00:22:01,400
to make a discovery based on these

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,130
sauces okay refocus here for traditional

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,260
internet I say we try every time to

00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,570
monetary finger we know that cannot

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,570
change but cannot if it is friend

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,320
abilities is clone active tools so for

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:22,300
this tool we have relative integration

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:31,940
here you can see sorry I have to say it

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:35,020
sorry Felicia problem sorry up again I'm

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,490
sorry can you do this for Communities

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,530
you cannot do this for abilities because

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,570
folk abilities of alternative you need

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:47,780
to discover everything so what we should

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:50,960
do is there may sources so I have

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,410
accumulated sources so sorry and then I

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,490
can apply it to supply then I will go

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,490
manage view

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:16,639
no no money I sure I play this I command

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,929
oh sorry

00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:22,820
are those horses sorry my bad

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:27,230
yeah kubernetes sauces everything is

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:30,200
safe walk is walking the doing what is

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:32,600
happening here is that the European side

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,630
is contacting the cluster and retrieve

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,649
all the namespaces and then if you go

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:42,399
there you will see that abdomen spaces

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:46,610
incriminates has been imported and then

00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:50,120
we do some I think we have this user -

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:53,960
now we say this user can have access to

00:23:50,120 --> 00:24:14,389
cube namespace to read this okay I will

00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:17,929
log out and then log again okay

00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:20,600
now the user has access to the view I

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:25,130
sent you everything's working here and

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,600
what you can see is that even here in

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,389
Google cloud platform you don't have

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,179
access to cube systems but here is

00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:34,519
useful to retrieve the namespace and we

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:39,010
have a view of what is happening this is

00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:42,110
a namespace sorry this is a namespace

00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,299
completely designed by Google to help

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,830
you have a clustering communities for

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:59,960
information so but you are able there to

00:24:47,830 --> 00:25:02,929
see what is happening here CC but we'll

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:10,460
see yes you have to agree to some

00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:12,780
because yeah I do look good okay and you

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,780
have easily

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:20,390
for any company a silly answer

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,390
information for each of the few sorry

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:29,220
envelop go back in the executive view we

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:35,580
are at and then if you have problem you

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:37,710
click on it and everything is ok ok I'll

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,850
go back to the presentation

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:44,540
ok I will show the last thing aggregate

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,540
view

00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,750
okay the last thing I want to show you I

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,899
talk to you about aggregation so I

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,380
recreated you now manually a reference

00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:18,190
manual

00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:27,669
we call it further right then I will say

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:34,029
this thing happy sub service a new order

00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:40,409
service this service I will say I think

00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:43,240
I will say this is external service

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:46,960
automatically I will have I'll give you

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:50,409
a half in my system this is application

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:57,970
service we create before the second one

00:26:50,409 --> 00:27:04,120
is Cuban it is radius yeah

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:08,230
similarly external service kubernetes

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:14,470
readies I can also have direct sources I

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:20,770
can also add under that item here to say

00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:25,270
this service is really raw checks coming

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:29,470
from this source no can you do this for

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:33,279
communities now harvester sources I will

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:40,620
show later which is a B sources then I

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:41,950
can select an item here and to say safe

00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,279
now

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:50,409
we go to the management view management

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:52,140
oh I see and then my favorite view I

00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:56,970
will assign it

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,970
logout and in

00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,190
we're not

00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:15,600
have no fear and view you will see one

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:19,230
thing will refresh you will see that

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,110
this should review depend on a singer

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,810
not that you don't have the review

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,490
expanded here because internally you

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,430
just have to collect the last stitches

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,520
of the view name I singer for the viewer

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:36,240
attache to I sing a note and also there

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,480
but you can see that my zabbix note here

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,630
it is a raw item coming from zabbix I

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,060
will show you quickly how are you

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,930
integrate with zabbix and we have finish

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,930
with this demo

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:26,800
oh forgot my purse 100 do what is

00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:30,940
happening no no okay good Passport so

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:34,690
last thing it is the big sausage just to

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,830
give last example you just have to

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:44,290
connect no sorry yeah

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:46,510
you just have to link to this URL and

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:49,240
then here I will not show you because

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:54,100
it's mine you have a string containing

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,790
the login and a password and it's okay

00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,820
then when you apply it viable just to

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:04,900
give an example you click here to make

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:08,320
the cooking partition so it's true

00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:12,130
and then I import everything in like a

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,730
zabbix knowing that what I don't show

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,980
yeah I didn't show you is that when you

00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,830
make the importation you can set a

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,860
filter here which can be a host or a

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:27,810
group to avoid important everything is

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:36,300
one that is a poly so that is the aim

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:36,300
for this torque sorry up

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:48,340
so this related ID for this talk up so

00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,409
that's why they like the spoon or the

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,150
stork so I hope that you learned

00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:54,520
something

00:30:51,150 --> 00:31:04,720
thank you if I question feel free to

00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:14,830
acts all right we have some time for

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:17,620
questions are there any questions can

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,350
you please show the aggregation screen

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,260
again well you can agree where you

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:29,470
define the status the worst or the best

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:41,159
state okay so I'm lost because this

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:41,159
cleaner I change this one what

00:31:52,429 --> 00:32:03,390
in the dito us I mean yes okay okay yes

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:06,809
simple thing okay yeah okay I spending a

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:09,870
half Craney we have free

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:14,039
we took a great sorority you have what

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:18,240
sorority basic before we say if I have

00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:21,870
three components and one go one is in

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,669
videos are feels enough weighted average

00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,370
is this like when you have a load

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:29,820
balancer component so if one things go

00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:33,750
wrong you can continue to operate so in

00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,880
this case actually we have a new status

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,340
in Europe inside to make someone in to

00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,539
say okay nothing wrong here but it's not

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,000
critical and the last one its weighted

00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:48,090
average it is more complicated which

00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,159
Matt beyond so you have the fact that

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:54,690
for us a which can say this service

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,419
count for 50% second over for 25% and

00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,299
the last one for 25% you can even say a

00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:02,549
half for component but have a critical

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:04,559
component an essential component this

00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:07,049
component is like you have a watch

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,360
sister watch service and then you have

00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:11,460
advanced beyond it before in front of

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,110
that and you say this the load balancer

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,970
is a critical component if the blood

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:17,990
burns will go wrong everything is wrong

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:21,179
and then you can have for our server

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:24,419
weighted average so this is a more

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:26,130
complex way to compute sorority yeah and

00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,890
then in you are free you this is

00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:31,309
aggregate taking into account this the

00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,309
suspect

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,300
hello let's say you have knowledge about

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,050
the services the business services in

00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,720
the CMDB

00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:53,830
yeah can you integrate the knowledge the

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,280
data of the CMDB into this tool Cory no

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,470
clearly it's not integrate but I think

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,220
regarding what this tool is designed

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:05,980
with just API based integration you can

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,460
integrate it you have just to you have

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,110
to develop some or just a wrapper that

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,650
we integrate in rope inside and that

00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:17,490
everything's up but the core algorithm

00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:20,560
the core component the core is a

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:23,140
separate part just not mix it with they

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,900
with where you implement the integration

00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,900
with a tar party - yeah you can do it

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:42,370
more questions no okay then we will

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,909
thank you for the talk and the goals and

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:52,070
see the present thank you

00:34:46,909 --> 00:35:03,229
[Applause]
