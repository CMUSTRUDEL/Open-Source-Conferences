Title: OSMC 2018 | Make IT monitoring ready for cloud-native systems by Rodrigue Chakode
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Modern cloud-nativeinfrastructures consist of large number of components components to monitor (hardware and software). You have to manage hundreds to thousands of components (e.g. container-based microservices). Effective monitoring in such an environment is complex and challenging, notably to avoid false alerts and to concentrate your efforts on incidents that matter. Monitoring should not be just a matter of getting raw metrics through your favorite monitoring tool (e.g. Prometheus) to draw nice graphs in Grafana. It’s important that, for each incident, you be able to assess (quickly?) how it really impacts your business. Hence you need to rely on incidents aggregation, along with dashboards and notification systems that take into account the real impact of every incident on your business services. In other words, you should for example avoid to fire a critical alert while a failed container does not critically impact your business services (e.g. a service you provide to your end-users). Assessing the real impact of each incident allows operations staffs to be able to prioritize issues based on those that have higher impacts on services.

That’s where this talk comes into play. The intent is to discuss advanced aggregation and visualization capabilities aiming at helping operations staffs to deal with monitoring with focus on business applications. We’ll also introduce RealOpInsight [1], an open source business application dashboard management tool that works on top of various existing monitoring systems, including, Nagios/Icinga and derived, Zabbix, and even more. We’ll finish by showing some examples and demo based on RealOpInsight and Icinga [2].

Among others, RealOpInsight provides the following features:

Service Impact & Root Cause Analysis
Business Service Management Map & Advanced Event Correlation
Multiple, Distributed & Heterogeneous Data Sources
Graphical Configuration Manager
Cross Operating Systems
Multi-Tenant/Service Provider Ready
