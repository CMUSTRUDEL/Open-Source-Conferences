Title: OSMC 2018 | Mit KI zu mehr Automatisierung bei der Fehleranalyse by Susanne Greiner
Publication date: 2018-11-17

Description: 
	With the proliferation of artificial intelligence, new IT monitoring approaches and the detection of anomalies in data traffic has been receiving particular attention. Thanks to the insights gained by anomaly detection based on machine learning methods error analysis can be notably accelerated and partly automated. An entire register of supervised and unsupervised learning methods is available as Open Source to help answer a wide range of questions where standard methods are stressed to their limits. Of course it needs the necessary expertise and experience to use the right approach for a specific problem. Challenges, that can be met when implementing such solutions and concrete advantages that have already been confirmed in practice are going to be shown by means of WÃ¼rth-Phoenix NetEye monitoring solution. Several more advances are expected in the months to come .
