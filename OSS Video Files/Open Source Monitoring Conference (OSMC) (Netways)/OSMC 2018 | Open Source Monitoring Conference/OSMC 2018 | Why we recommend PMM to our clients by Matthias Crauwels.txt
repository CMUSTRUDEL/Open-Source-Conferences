Title: OSMC 2018 | Why we recommend PMM to our clients by Matthias Crauwels
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	As service providers, one of our responsibilities is helping clients understand what causes contributed to a production downtime incident, and how to avoid (as much as possible) them from happening again. We do this with Incident Reports, and one common recommendation we make is to have a historical monitoring system in place. All our clients have point-in-time monitoring solutions in place, solutions that can alert them when a system is down or behaving in unacceptable ways. But historical monitoring is still not common, and we believe a lot of companies can benefit from deploying one of them. In most cases, we have recommended Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), as a good and Open Source solution for this problem. In this session, we will talk about the reasons why we recommend PMM as a way to prevent incidents, and also to investigate their possible causes when one has happened.
