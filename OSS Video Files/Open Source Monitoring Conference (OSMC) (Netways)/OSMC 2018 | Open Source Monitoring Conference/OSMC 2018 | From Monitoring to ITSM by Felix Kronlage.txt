Title: OSMC 2018 | From Monitoring to ITSM by Felix Kronlage
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Having monitoring is good. Having proper alerting is better. Integrating monitoring with ticketing is awesome.

Todays open source ticketing landscape ranges from longtime players such as BestPractical’s RequestTracker to newcomers such as Zammad. Thanks to modern APIs on all sides a set of tools is easily transformed into an ITSM stack – routing incidents from monitoring into the ticketing, keeping everyone in the loop and laying the baseline for being able to offer better service level agreements.

While this talk gives a broad overview of available options it concludes with concrete examples as well as recommendations on how to implement and deploy such a setup.

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:19,800
thanks and welcome to the talk the

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,230
alternate title for this talk would be

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,689
actually the lean approach to ITSM

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,210
because people do lean stuff nowadays

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,760
and the idea of the talk is to give an

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,470
idea how to dive into this subject from

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,210
just having monitoring and to actually

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,640
engage with your customers via ticketing

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,739
and since we're the monitoring

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,070
conference I want to start off with a

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,780
couple of quotes monitoring strategy

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,559
should start from the businesses KPIs

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,559
that actually flew by Twitter it's from

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,500
Devdas Bhagat and to ops well I really

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,360
agree with him for ups people it's a bit

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,250
difficult to grasp so I would actually

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,829
put it as I heard at monitor Amma and

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,109
nine years ago monitoring needs to

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,019
enable your team to engage which is

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,560
actually a nice way of putting it

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,720
so let me introduce myself I'm Felix and

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,700
I come from the times where you actually

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,070
would run an open finger daemon on the

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,330
on the network to the outside to

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,340
actually retrieve information and

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,290
publish information about yourself so

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,650
I've been doing open source for quite

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,710
some time and I just very recently

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,509
joined grit scale and this next

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,119
generation infrastructure as a service

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,479
and platform as a service vendor as the

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,990
product owner and probably more people

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,590
know me from the company I've ran for 15

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,619
years bite mine bite mine is in Linux

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,829
UNIX open-source consultancy agency up

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,369
in North Germany I found it bite mine in

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,939
2003 and was a CEO until the end of last

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,280
year and lots of what I'm going to talk

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,990
about here today is actually things we

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,229
gather that bite mine learnings from

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:05,040
that and how we actually came to ITSM at

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,979
bite mine and aside from that if I'm if

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,450
I'm not working there I'm a member of

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,440
the board of the open-source Business

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,760
Alliance which is a nonprofit

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,890
organization in Germany

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,620
that promotes open source on a political

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:20,049
level good example is if you have a call

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,620
for bits we make sure that actually

00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:27,670
open-source solutions looked at the same

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:31,510
way as proprietary solutions so that to

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,370
myself and of course I'm a long term D

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,829
user that's kind of how I started with

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:41,470
open source stuff so I'm run these deep

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:43,959
I teach them a fairly nice term and the

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,150
definition for that is IT Service

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,940
Management refers to the entirety of

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,760
activities directed by policies

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,739
organized instructed in processes and

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,310
supporting procedures that are performed

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,510
by an organization to design plan

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,389
deliver operate and control information

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,389
technology services offers to customers

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:07,569
that's actually I looked it up and put

00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:10,120
it there in a sarten that's again fairly

00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:12,370
hard to grasp if you try to get the

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,680
point across so I would like to put it

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,199
in my own terms

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,819
IT Service Management enables us to

00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,639
liver a superior customer experience

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,340
when things go wrong and I'm sure

00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:27,250
everyone in the audience will agree

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,699
things will go wrong and then looking at

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,790
at ITSM there are certain building

00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:37,709
blocks and one is definitely easy

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:42,040
process that outlines certain things

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:45,160
another one is monitoring the third one

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:50,489
is service desking often referred to as

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:55,750
ticketing and last but not least it's

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:59,590
CMDB and while process is a nice term

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,590
it's again hard to describe so I would

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,989
like to put it as standard operating

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,829
procedures which is the term that for

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:13,019
ops people much easier to understand and

00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:15,430
much easier to get across CMDB again I

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,810
would like to put it as asset management

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:23,440
and coming to the first part of the

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,200
building blocks the process or SOP a

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,050
process needs to enable people in your

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,180
to actually engage at anonymously if

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,310
they have some issue they need to

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,420
actually know how to deal with livets

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,040
themselves without without actually

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,200
insane so if you have an all-time an

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,510
organization for many years they usually

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,820
know stuff implicitly how to deal with

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,540
an outage and that's what often is

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,980
referred to as muscle memory and that's

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,980
a very implicit saying because it's

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,050
build up over time and something that is

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,450
very implicit Lee it's kind of hard for

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,030
newcomers and the process actually needs

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,210
to be a guidance and not a handcuff a

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,100
colleague of mine said a while ago show

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,890
me a process I'm going to show you a way

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,200
around it and by that is actually he

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,570
showed me the in that way that's very

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,640
very good if you have a process that

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,710
actually feels like a guidance and

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,090
actually makes things easier and not

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:24,070
hurdles you in any way so the process

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,010
needs to be taken from very being very

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,290
implicit e to being explicitly and by

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,560
doing so another thing needs to be

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:38,110
observed or taken care of you need to

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,910
have reasons not rules and when we when

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,340
we first started having having more

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,140
customers advised mine a colleague of

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,600
mine on of our first employees

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,550
approached me and said hey Felix I I

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,690
read on the internet that wasn't I think

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,130
in 2008-2009 hey I've read hey there are

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,440
some organizations that have established

00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,230
so-called standard operating procedures

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,430
and what they do is actually write down

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,170
how to handle a certain incident so that

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,780
people know in the moment the incident

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,270
happens how to react instead of then

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,920
starting to think about it and by

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,190
actually writing down standard operating

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,410
procedures when established is building

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,690
building blocks for establishing a

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,820
process and you actually help increase

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:27,310
equality by establishing certain

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,500
standards how to handle incidents so a

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,840
good example for such an SOP is actually

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,490
the first SOP he wrote was how to write

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,370
an SOP and see second when he wrote was

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,260
how to deal with the phone outage at our

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,790
office because we started very early

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,800
with voice of IP

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,990
we would sometimes experience phone

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,270
outages so we need to have a way to

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,980
handle that so he sat down and basically

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,920
what he just did he opened up a wiki

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,450
page and the red man started writing him

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,910
first is verify the outage actually

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,890
makes sure how up phone is he problem ii

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,800
published a predefined item for this

00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,110
case on our status page certain forms

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,300
the rest of the company force open a

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,300
ticket for the phone company and last

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,000
but not least if the item is resolved d

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,400
publish the status item and by actually

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,840
doing that he made sure that if he's not

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,640
around because he knew how to deal with

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,190
it but if he's not around some other

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,350
guys would know what to do and would

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,390
just follow the procedure while the

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,300
phone outage is a very simple example a

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,430
much much better or much harder example

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,340
is for example dr BD if you have a

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,810
cluster of the OBD nodes and you're

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,060
called out and another of the night

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,190
because of the alerting engine calls you

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,290
and you are on duty it's much easier if

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,730
you actually run down to standard

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,040
operating procedures for dealing with

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,140
that outage and so then sitting there

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,330
and thinking huh what am i have to do

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,520
now who do I have to call where do I

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,640
have to open a ticket so that makes it

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,800
just much easier and the bonus is you

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,780
lowers a barrier for newcomers to your

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:02,260
organization's so that's the process

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,990
part and coming to that the next step is

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,610
in monitoring and we had a monitoring

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,130
conference and I'm sure everybody does

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,380
monitoring so and monitoring is of

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,030
course not boring but I'm obviously

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,270
preaching to the choir of a certain

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:18,490
stuff but I want to repeat certain

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,870
things I'm monitoring because while we

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,900
all know him it's kind of good to

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,300
actually have him present so I was

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,430
sitting in a talk from Martin Africa

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,070
from example 42 the other day and he

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,380
said so who is doing monitoring and

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,479
everybody raised their hands and he said

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,680
well I'm I'm not doing monitoring

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,740
anymore I'm doing metrics still we have

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:46,350
something that generates events and

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:50,350
based on that possibly alerts someone I

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,990
see now for example so a monitoring

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,060
should trigger a genuine action

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,339
and it should disrupt your routine and

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,830
by that it assists in achieving higher

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:01,720
quality and that's actually something

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,450
you cannot repeat often enough because

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,970
I've now every time I came into a

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,060
company that has some sort of monitoring

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,339
I always see these certain red alerts

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,920
that everybody ignores and say yeah

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,209
that's been like that for ages yeah we

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,610
know it doesn't matter

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,320
and so that's something I actually want

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,970
to get across it's really important that

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,080
monitoring should always trigger a

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,209
genuine action and disrupt the routine

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,330
so for the monitoring pod everybody has

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:34,830
monitoring so that's good service

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,570
desking service desking ticketing

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:39,790
request tracker is one of the V famous

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,250
examples actually one of the the

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,660
Alzheimer's and also available from from

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,880
net waste in the software as a service

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,550
offering and it's actually what I

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,990
started with many years ago because I

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,510
started in the ICP businesses and

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,700
requests check I was what everybody used

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,790
there then this of course

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,240
OTRS also a famous candidate for having

00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:05,140
some sort of ticketing and new to the

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,959
game new is Samad Samad is actually a

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,920
ticketing that is built by one of the

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:16,079
founders of OTRS so it's not a fork it's

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,670
a brand new approach to to ticketing and

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,589
Martine when he started some up actually

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,899
wanted to make sure that he approaches

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,060
ticketing to a new to the way it's being

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,430
done now basically by people not only

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,410
using email to submit tickets but also

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:34,750
have various other channels like chat

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,850
telegram social media whatever and also

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,649
because lately I'm not quite sure how

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,260
old he is still fits into the open

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,630
source game I just zap him from his life

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,089
so it's right now request record some

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:49,660
art probably for example Chara service

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,250
desk or whatever so the service desk is

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,829
the paper trail for all customer

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,930
interaction and it makes sure that you

00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:59,200
have a good hand over in between teams

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,660
in between people and you handle

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,730
customer expectations with the ticketing

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,770
because everybody can still follow the

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,920
whole trail and it raises the overall

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,230
quality

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,600
customer interactions actually the whole

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,670
company history of baikman lives in our

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,790
request tracker there I actually set it

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,620
up in 2003 and it was used ever since so

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,810
if you have some customer you can look

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,279
up the whole history with that inside

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,529
the request tracker very good if you

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:29,420
actually want to find out why some

00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:31,639
decision was made 10 years ago and the

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,949
force building walk Z is the asset

00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,510
management is the mat in my opinion the

00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:37,940
toughest one of all of them and I'm

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,709
actually very happy that I only have 30

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,630
minutes lot for the talk because if I

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,160
would have a 60 minute talk I would

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,480
actually have to dive into this subject

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,199
very deeply so I can just slither along

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,660
with it

00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:54,079
various solutions all feel very bulky

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,360
icing and there's asset management built

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,579
into a request tracker I never really

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,199
got to use it at at bite man we actually

00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,449
developed something that's called ITB

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,810
which is an infrastructure database that

00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:09,350
basically build around a set of agents

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:12,410
that collect infos from various REST API

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,649
so it's all open source you can find it

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,089
on github 0 and its own project so if

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,690
you don't have anything where you

00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:25,279
actually track assets and some sort of

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:29,390
changes look at that so we have the

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,230
process with SOPs we have monitoring and

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,329
we have the Service Desk so how does

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,459
that all fit together and actually

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:41,149
that's the the next slide is I welcome

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,949
you to the eye doctor exam slide I hope

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,449
you all have good eyes and if you can't

00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:47,120
read it you should see the doctor

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,890
probably no sorry

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,970
basically what I'm just trying to show

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,470
is that monitoring is being triggered

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:59,000
alert is sent out to the alerting engine

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,920
and support case is created and what

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,779
what we used to have is basically

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,910
monitoring alert is sent out to the

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,620
people on call somebody will probably

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,250
take care of but nobody's really sure

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,620
is it being taken care of or not so and

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,709
by that actually now people go to the

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:19,100
ticketing see there's a ticket grab the

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:20,570
ticket and works through the chain so

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,930
connecting things

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:27,770
that's actually how I started loving the

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:31,550
GU code at bite mine we developed Jason

00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:33,830
our tapi which is a ruby based wrapper

00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,830
around the command line interface to

00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:41,420
request tracker and Jason are tapi

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:43,910
exposed Jason HTTP API and as such you

00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,910
can communicate from the outside via

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,720
rest request with request a cup but

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,330
Becklund

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,450
request check I did not have its own API

00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,420
so we had to actually use that that way

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,700
and we hooked it into icinga I won back

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,090
then actually it was even before that it

00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:05,330
was an abuse and via commands very easy

00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:08,840
to do and some blog posts and the code

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,450
is there it's basically on the slides

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,570
for legacy reasons because nowadays with

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,550
icinga - we we can go a different way

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,700
and also because request tracker now has

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:22,550
a REST API as well we can use a single

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,290
to our T which is golang based so you

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:28,270
have a single static binary that you can

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,650
compile adverbs using a two event API

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:33,710
there's also a package released for that

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,010
under bite mine slash goalie singer -

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:40,820
and this submits events to the RT REST

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:45,200
API if somebody looks at the RT REST API

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,810
that is built into RT by default you

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,780
will see that it is some sort of rest

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,350
but not really because it returns very

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:58,250
bulky texts to you and nothing like a

00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:02,540
nice nice jason it works very well but

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:05,840
can be improved so there comes something

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,080
else and took the game what I call roto

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,030
shoot and basically I had to come up

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,030
with all go because if you don't have a

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:18,860
logo it didn't happen so roto shoot is

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:23,300
again : based and it's eating at to RT

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,550
revisited and I think a year or two

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,340
years ago there was actually a new REST

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,560
API published for request tracker that's

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,780
actually an add-on that you can install

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,699
alongside with it and that expose a very

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,689
nice rest

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:39,999
API and a singer to Artie use the old

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:42,639
one rotor suit is actually reworked to

00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:44,889
work with the new API and also has a

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,540
nice addition for further ticketing and

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:51,369
it's available there and basically what

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,639
what happens if you use something like a

00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:57,540
singer - Artie or roto shoot is you

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,389
start up you subscribe to the event loop

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:04,509
for a singer - you possibly get an event

00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:07,269
trigger from the monitoring API you look

00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:10,209
up in your own local cache database do I

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,389
know that event do I don't know it is it

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:16,119
a relevant event yes and then you either

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,040
create a ticket or if it's a known event

00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:20,649
you just update the ticket with some new

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,660
metadata or you delete the ticket if it

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,639
has been resolved of course we only

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,079
deletes a ticket if it is a ticket

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,689
itself has not changed its status

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,689
because what happens is ticket is

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,669
created i see the alert i want to work

00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:35,499
on the issue and actually go resolve it

00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:38,079
and the first thing i do because that's

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:39,939
outlined in my process is i takes a

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,379
ticket by that i communicate to all my

00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:44,079
colleagues say i'm taking care of this

00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,089
and rhodol should we actually see that

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,289
it's been taken i will not further deal

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:54,999
of the ticket and looks back again

00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:57,069
subscribes to the event loop and for the

00:16:54,999 --> 00:17:01,600
singer people we all know the typical

00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:03,639
states so rodas rule has a local file

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
where it actually can be defined how to

00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,269
deal with each of them and whether to

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,169
update or delete a ticket in certain

00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:12,639
cases and what I just described

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,620
basically looks like that rotor suit

00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:17,949
monitoring event stream goes to the

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:24,569
ticket API and from there some guy

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:27,970
handles it so what's next photo shoot is

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:29,350
actually finished support for vomit and

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,899
that's something I've been working on

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,389
lately I want to fully support some art

00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,909
because that's a very nice of doing very

00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:39,159
nice way of doing ticketing and also

00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,940
support other monitoring solutions such

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:45,760
as Prometheus or possibly sensu and then

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,020
look at adding support for arbitrary

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,700
outbound country

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:54,340
books and there are some further

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,410
resources there's actually from the

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,360
singer people a nice collection of

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,210
singer to API examples where they

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,840
collect all sorts of of libraries that

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,120
somehow hook into I sing are too if you

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,800
want to play around with requests Tech

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,370
and actually try things out as a nice

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:19,740
docker image available and also there's

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:23,650
for some at docker image as well so that

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:26,230
leaves one and a half minutes before we

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,960
start with questions but I can say

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:36,270
already thanks for listening are there

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:45,130
any questions seriously no questions

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:46,540
there's a question there yeah I think we

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,240
might have talked about this on Twitter

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,330
at some point but we wrote a similar

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,730
tool to your thing a notification script

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,470
for RT and one of the things I found

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,970
really helpful was making sure that the

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,000
ticket was commented back in the

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:03,180
acknowledgement in the comment field in

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,490
in the ticketing in you know chinga yeah

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,750
that way people can see which ticket is

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,190
tracking which outage when they look at

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,480
the dashboards and all those kind of

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,430
things is that disburse should have that

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,470
feature as well no but it's a very good

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,690
idea actually because you can actually

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,390
do it very nicely by as the API that's a

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:24,280
very good point yes no I will add it to

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:29,320
the list of things I should add it's

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:32,440
awesome very good very good so everybody

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,930
has a well established ITSM process and

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,880
everybody has hooked monitoring into the

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,880
ticketing so this was a whole no brainer

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,050
yeah does they're a new service now for

00:19:41,870 --> 00:20:28,550
ticketing did you make it work with your

00:19:45,050 --> 00:20:29,710
monitoring system how's the bill that's

00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,660
what we're here for

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:40,820
we still have ten minutes so we might as

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:43,270
well anything else okay well thanks out

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:51,260
there there's a question

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:54,290
we found a question are there any alerts

00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:59,450
where you don't recommend opening a

00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:01,400
ticket automatic well for for the stuff

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,120
that that we did at bite my we actually

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,710
made sure that only alerts are triggered

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,210
for stuff where we want to react to

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,710
because otherwise it wouldn't be an

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,840
alert that's because basically if I if I

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,930
don't react if I don't need to react to

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,300
any Ludd why should I create an alert in

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,850
the first place for informational

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,950
purposes yeah you know there are

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:29,660
different types of ticketing the ticket

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,810
requests for information or requests for

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:36,140
change and all these things may be there

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:39,620
you don't create only incident tickets

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,900
some other ticket types well what we

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,210
actually have is some that that can be

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,740
configured both in a single - Artie or

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,680
wrote oh shoot is that you actually

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,830
submit the tickets to certain cues or

00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,059
all that or certain recipients or that

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,220
so

00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,379
for there's a differentiation on the

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,990
ticketing side of course wetlands and

00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:01,879
for example for for certain customers we

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,429
would actually route those tickets in to

00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:08,059
a customer queue and then the customer

00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:10,879
queue on the ticketing side has has

00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,860
configured whom to notify via the

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:15,559
ticketing because that's again up to the

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,450
ticketing on where to send so certain

00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:21,460
customers where we would have an SLA

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:24,409
would actually once the the singer to RT

00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,450
sends the event to the ticketing ticket

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,759
was created and the customer got an

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,309
email from the ticketing hey we recorded

00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:32,960
something that now by my needs to react

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,029
to because that was part of the SLA

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,860
agreement and that's what it's actually

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:40,009
very nice because you know when the time

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,169
starts ticking and you can easily define

00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:44,090
that in these support contracts because

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:46,669
also part of the support contractors is

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:48,980
then that because usually if you have an

00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:51,039
SLA you have something like from the

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,549
moment the customer reported an incident

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:57,470
time ticks and you can actually increase

00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,879
or you actually can increase the value

00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,840
you offer to the customer if you

00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,139
actually put in there

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,669
well the notification doesn't need to

00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:06,169
come from the customer itself but it can

00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:08,119
also be generated from the ticketing

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:11,090
because that's a higher value than for

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,960
the customer yeah does it answer the

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,960
question thank you

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,330
instead a need for merging tickets

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,910
because if you generate the ticket

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:30,549
automatically from alarms you probably

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:34,280
have a la alarm multiple tickets fee for

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:36,740
now actually singer - Artie and Rhoda

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:41,000
shoot but they both they correlate

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:44,960
so if I for if the if it this is filling

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,960
up and I get an alert for the in via the

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,559
event API in a notification for the same

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,480
alert every 15 minutes or whatever it

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,059
detects that it's still the same and

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,179
doesn't create recreate a ticket however

00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:01,700
if the status information changes it

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:03,710
updates you ticket so what happens for

00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,140
example is a if you have a warning

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,990
warning disk is becoming critical

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,910
it opens ticket then the disc switches

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,790
to critical because it's being filled

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,490
even more your singer to RT updates the

00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:20,090
same ticket with information now it is

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:22,429
critical for that it does so there's

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,020
there's no merging needed because you

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:30,770
only work on one ticket the whole time

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:32,419
for this one one alert basically because

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,910
you have unique identifiers for the

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,590
alerts so you can actually identify is

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,799
it still the same issue that's popping

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:42,679
up boys are different there's you I'm

00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:45,590
convinced and I'm convinced expelling on

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,929
the view if you have alarm about the

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,270
disc which is getting fooled and it's

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,130
probably the system admin which is

00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,380
interested in this information and he

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,240
has to take action the customer to

00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,620
because maybe I'm not reacting to it so

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,390
I'm not valuing the SLA the hdt customer

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,280
probably certainly interested in in it

00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:12,200
services in the business case you know

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:13,460
and no I know I comprehend see questions

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,799
though you're asking you have like

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,240
basically you have five alerts they all

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,880
are four different parts of the problem

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,080
but for the customer it is one problem

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
because the website is not reachable

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,179
yes well right now there's no merging

00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:35,840
done because basically a few that's

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,999
that's monitoring philosophy I guess but

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,129
the four in that case the ops people

00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:43,529
should get an alert for all the

00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:46,639
technical issues and there should

00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:49,019
probably for the customer side a

00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:51,600
separate checks that actually checks the

00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:54,389
business logic and that's the thing the

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,279
customer should get for example the

00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:59,610
customers interested is the website

00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,840
running or not well while the ops people

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,580
might still need to know that they

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,710
actually need to know of the database

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,509
crash behind it and so that's basically

00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,070
more or less something you should

00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,950
probably configure in the monitoring

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:16,649
side who is being alerted and the ticket

00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:18,690
is the overall thing that the customer

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:20,220
sees and that you actually take as the

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:29,940
ops person to say I'm working on the

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:33,869
overall problem that's okay so we have

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,389
four moments anything I was really

00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:38,669
actually looking into not doing overtime

00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:45,350
because I guess a lot of people want to

00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:49,019
go to the singer to status update so now

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,720
then I would like people to give a hands

00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,129
to the OS MC or got people because

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,059
they're doing really a great job and

00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,059
it's not some conference

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,770
and if you want to reach me you can

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:10,150
write me an email right via Twitter and

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,530
well thank you very much we have a

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,980
little present for you still you be

00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,790
there you go

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,220
Thanks well thank you for listening

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:32,079
[Applause]
