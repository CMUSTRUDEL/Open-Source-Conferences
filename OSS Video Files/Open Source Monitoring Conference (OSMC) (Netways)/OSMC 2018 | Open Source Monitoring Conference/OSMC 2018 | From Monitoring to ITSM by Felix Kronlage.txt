Title: OSMC 2018 | From Monitoring to ITSM by Felix Kronlage
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Having monitoring is good. Having proper alerting is better. Integrating monitoring with ticketing is awesome.

Todays open source ticketing landscape ranges from longtime players such as BestPractical’s RequestTracker to newcomers such as Zammad. Thanks to modern APIs on all sides a set of tools is easily transformed into an ITSM stack – routing incidents from monitoring into the ticketing, keeping everyone in the loop and laying the baseline for being able to offer better service level agreements.

While this talk gives a broad overview of available options it concludes with concrete examples as well as recommendations on how to implement and deploy such a setup.
