Title: OSMC 2018 | SLA Monitoring mit Icinga & Prometheus by Moritz Tanzer
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Our hosted customer services are committed to a strict SLA, so we need a monitoring system which is high available and is able to distinguish specific regional network outages from SLA violations while still producing useful monitoring data. The satellites use diverse upstream providers and are located at different locations.
Therefor we instrument several open source tools to scrape and aggregate metrics from a customer perspective.
We built a setup with multiple Icinga2 nodes combined with a vary of prometheus exporter and instances which can operate completely independent. In a reporting purpose we decided to have a fully redundant monitoring setup with consistent data off all distributed satellites.
