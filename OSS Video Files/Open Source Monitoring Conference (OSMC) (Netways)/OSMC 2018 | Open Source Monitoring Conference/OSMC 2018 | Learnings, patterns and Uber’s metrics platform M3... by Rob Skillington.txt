Title: OSMC 2018 | Learnings, patterns and Uber’s metrics platform M3... by Rob Skillington
Publication date: 2018-11-17
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	At Uber we use high cardinality monitoring to observe and detect issues with our 4,000 microservices running on Mesos and across our infrastructure systems and servers.  We’ll cover how we put the resulting 6 billion plus time series to work in a variety of different ways, auto-discovering services and their usage of other systems at Uber, setting up and tearing down alerts automatically for services, sending smart alert notifications that rollup different failures into individual high level contextual alerts, and more.  We’ll also talk about how we accomplish all this with a global view of our systems with M3, our open source metrics platform.  We’ll take a deep dive look at how we use M3DB, now available as an open source Prometheus long term storage backend, to horizontally scale our metrics platform in a cost efficient manner with a system that’s still sane to operate with petabytes of metrics data.
