Title: OSMC 2018 | 10 years of OSMC: Why does my monitoring still look the same? by Michael Medin
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Little over 10 years ago I packed my brand new Sony Ericsson W910i, my IRiver mp3 player to fly to Nuremberg to attended my very first OSMC as an amazingly proud Nagios administrator…
Now 10 years later I am back: To share with you how my monitoring has changed over the course of the last decade!

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,029
thank you

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,850
can you hear me yeah presumably since no

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,890
one is responding anyway this talk is

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,170
gonna be about going to the conference

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,210
for the last 10 years or so essentially

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,189
knowing nothing about monitoring to

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,399
going to knowing nothing about

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,760
monitoring so it's sort of my journey

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,230
from one to the other and as always any

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,930
questions or anything feel free to chime

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,360
in though for four reasons which will

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,840
later be apparent you want but let's get

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,910
started

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,710
so I usually title myself as an

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,199
architect not because I am an architect

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,660
but because I've noticed that old people

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,840
are architects and I've started to get

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,730
old it's it's horrible but it actually

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,219
happens you know what I love to do is

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,140
build things I I love the concept of

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,689
building you know creating going from

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,360
nothing to something without just your

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,280
hands and your imagination it's that

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,950
magical feeling when you can see that

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,930
there is nothing here until suddenly

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,790
there is something there right that's

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,009
what I get off on I I don't really care

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,299
for the whole you know drawing things

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,759
but I do like to point my finger

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,040
sometimes so that's a good thing anyway

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,470
this is usually how I look when I am NOT

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,600
building things this is me skiing for

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,680
the first and almost last time in my

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,070
life I also have two girls at home who

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,659
are essentially useless thus far in the

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,079
last eight years they have committed

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,610
zero lines of code you know I was I was

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,140
thinking you know and it's client you

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,259
know as a three-team guy is gonna be

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,350
awesome but no it's just you know me

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
instead taking care of them yeah don't

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,159
get kids that's what I'm saying

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
but but at least nowadays when I'm not

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,320
building something I am slightly happier

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,990
because I can go skiing again because

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,430
they bothered me into it but that's not

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,979
why we're here right because we're gonna

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,270
talk about Anna's client and actually

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,700
we're not going to talk about Anna's

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,890
client this year and I don't always talk

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,140
about Anna's client is just frequently

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,660
a couple of years back I did application

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,520
monitoring trying to get people to stop

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,010
monitoring Hardware and instead

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,680
monitoring applications and then I did

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,170
why we do monitoring wrong trying to get

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,590
people to stop monitoring Hardware and

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,940
instead start monitoring applications

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,740
and this year I'm essentially doing the

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,240
opposite because I'm doing a talk where

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm trying to get people to stop

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,250
monitoring applications and start

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,010
monitoring Hardware instead so we'll see

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,950
how that turns out the original title

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,230
for this talk was the cynical history of

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,239
monitoring but I felt it was a bit too

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,459
depressing so I changed it into ten

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,950
years and see because it sounded

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,660
slightly more happy right and the

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,690
original byline was really you know how

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,510
Netflix ruined monitoring and everything

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,820
else and I want to be clear I don't I

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,450
don't hate stranger things I dissolve

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,980
stranger things but yeah yeah there's

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,510
one other guy who also loved strange

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,100
things but but the problem here is that

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,780
they do eight episodes which are

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,320
watching one day and then there's

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,850
nothing for 365 days and then there is

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,010
eight more episodes and then there is

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,470
nothing for like four five six hundred

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,840
days and this four there is still

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,510
nothing so I'm getting you know you know

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,760
I need my fix I need you know a constant

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,070
flow you know we have a contract 26

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,519
episodes one every week across the year

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,350
not not nothing for years and years but

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,940
anyway I'm digressing what I'm talking

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,010
about is going to the open source

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,709
monitoring conference ten years ago and

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,630
this was the first time for me going to

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,260
noon bug I don't know anything about

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,150
nieuwenburg

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,190
well not correct I knew two things about

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,390
Newburgh the first one apparently was a

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:02,790
lie because because this this is not in

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:04,620
nürnberg yeah the other thing you tend

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,590
to knew about Newburgh is obviously the

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,470
really seriously space headphones

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,269
they had back in there in the forties

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,970
but for me what I always remember is

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,220
that I was scared to death because I'm a

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,840
developer I don't I don't do monitoring

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,430
I don't know anything about monitoring

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,039
I've never worked with monitoring I

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,630
develop stuff and then I eventually end

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,200
up having to run them which means that I

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,290
need to monitor them right

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,850
but it's always been a side gig for me

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,560
and when you're gonna do a talk in front

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,210
of people who are presumably working

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
with monitoring when you don't know

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,110
anything about monitoring you have this

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
fear that someone will eventually an

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,130
erase their hand ago hey Michael you're

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,910
completely wrong and I'd be like yeah I

00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,530
know I don't know this stuff you guys do

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,940
and and for me that's always been the

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,740
greatest fear right that someone is

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,560
going to call my ruse right and tell me

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,910
that I don't know what I'm talking about

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,800
and that's the one thing I've learned

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,230
from going to this conference that no

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,570
one here for deaths you know I can go up

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:05,170
here and say whatever crazy I want

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,360
and you'll just be like awesome this guy

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,860
knows way more than me because I have no

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,780
idea what he's talking about so

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,330
essentially what I'm doing is a Trump

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,370
you know I'm just lying you know I'm

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,000
just gonna you know come up with

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,220


00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,670
stuff from the top of my head that has

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,090
no sense or bearing whatsoever but it

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,710
works and that's the cool thing about it

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,180
but anyway I'm digressing you know 10

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,940
years ago when I came to this conference

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,660
I had this little eye with me it's the

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,070
sony ericsson w9 10 i and you know for

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,140
the youngsters in the room

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,210
ten years ago phones came in different

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,280
form factors you have like slider phones

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,040
you had like flip phones and you have

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,810
all sorts of weird phones not just what

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,380
we have today which is the broken glass

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,880
phone right I don't really know why but

00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,610
all the hipsters have them

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,640
I myself tend to try to not do the

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,130
broken glass edition but the interesting

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,930
thing is that when I was researching for

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,030
the researching that sounds grand right

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,290
when I was preparing slides for this

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,990
toolkit which essentially is google

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,170
image search I found this

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,090
so the slider phone is back you know and

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm totally getting it once it hits

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,260
Europe apparently it's it's a Chinese

00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,320
phone right so they're way ahead of us

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:23,920
but but you know if you compare my phone

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,810
and now to you know my phone back then

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,120
there is a slight difference because

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,950
this one is way larger you know back in

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,330
days to try to make smaller things

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,180
nowadays is going to be bigger and

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,000
bigger and bigger but you know my phone

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,310
had about 40 megabytes of RAM which is

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you know pretty much what every one

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,250
application

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,010
is using nowadays it technically had

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,010
internet and it had a Walkman which was

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,230
like the ten year ago mp3 player thingy

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,750
right but of course that didn't really

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,000
works I also had a real mp3 player with

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:59,320
me and the interesting thing about this

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,510
mp3 player is that it had the dongle you

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,180
know you can see it up here right so ten

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,600
years ago we before Apple invented a

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,130
dongle I had it I had the dongle first

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,140
right and the interesting thing is that

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,150
the dongle goes the other way so you

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,430
plug it into the headphone jack and out

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,760
comes a USB port but you know it's the

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,470
exact same thing right and of course you

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,050
know because I'm a gadget freak I had my

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,690
tablet with me this is what tablet look

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,610
back then and once you hel this in your

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,470
hand you could almost feel like this was

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,870
Star Trek right you walked around with

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,190
it then you could like it swiping and

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,380
things didn't work so you had to click

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,640
yeah but but still you know and and you

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,290
had to use the keyboard most the time

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,770
but still it felt like Star Trek right

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,570
and I've always loved technology and you

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,450
know the the stuff that we will

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,300
eventually get right and for me Star

00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,400
Trek was never about aliens and and

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,620
stories and things like that it was

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,690
always about the gadgets you know when

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,550
when when Picard and there's the room

00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,770
and goes you know like tea Earl Grey hot

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,479
it's the reason why I drink tea you know

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,140
why I don't drink coffee because I'm

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,630
gonna say that to my tea maker and and

00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,160
all of these things you know like tell

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,950
them them to turn on the lights and you

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,840
know talking to your computer all of

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,510
this stuff has always been what I enjoy

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,870
and what I like and you know 10 years

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:21,160
ago I I wired some cables to my door so

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,470
that when I opened the door the lights

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,910
turned on I of course it executed myself

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,250
in the process but still it was cool

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,610
right you know you could feel that you

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,250
know this is the future and then then

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,990
this comes along and I go like wow I

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,909
don't want to talk to my computer I want

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,270
to go like this you know kung fu you

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,520
know and now I have a touch computer

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,770
then you realize that it's just like

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,240
kung fu that you know sitting like this

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,610
for hours and hours means that you need

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,040
strength in your arms which which I

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,710
don't possess so so I never used a touch

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,510
computer and a lot of these Maha

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,130
and technology if you will you know

00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,440
tends out to be like that you know it

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,480
looks awesome on paper and then once you

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,210
actually get it you realize that yeah

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,010
not really my thing but still you know

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,450
you you really wanna want to be cool

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,000
right then you want to have all this

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,040
future technology which is why I have an

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,200
entire room full with you know useless

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,040
stuff that I bought throughout years at

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,950
home the reason why I'm telling you this

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,620
is because we are living in a world of

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,050
magic you know ten years ago all the

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,560
stuff that I imagined the future would

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,380
hold

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,990
I pretty much have today all of the

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:37,540
stuff that ten years ago was science

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:40,450
fiction has turned into reality so we

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,190
are living in this magical world where

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,420
you know I can actually talk to my

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,910
computer it's not science fiction

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,490
anymore when I get home I say hey Google

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,920
unlock my door and it unlocks my doors

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,300
now this is idiotic because my

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,920
neighbor's can do the same thing and the

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,460
thieves can do the same thing but I

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,140
don't care because it's awesome you know

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,930
the feeling that you know my voice

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,730
controls the lock to my door is enough

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,050
for me to have this feature and of

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,670
course you know I can you know tell it

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,030
to turn on the lights I can tell it to

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,740
turn on

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,170
you know the television and all that

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,270
stuff ten years ago I bought a special

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,980
headset I had Dragon Dictate in my

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,590
computer and I spent hours and hours

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,690
trying to teach it my voice and the way

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,340
you did it was essentially teaching it

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:27,280
your voice so you sat there going like

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:32,500
dog dog dog and then you had to go to

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,480
the next was a cat hat hat and you spent

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,120
hours and hours just repeating these

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,400
words and and still you know you could

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,830
barely use it to start things and use it

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,010
for commands right a couple of weeks ago

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,390
my google home started to speak Swedish

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,190
I'll just woke up one morning and say

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,660
you know hey Google Voice lockdown and

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,000
it responded back to me in Swedish I

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,460
didn't train it I didn't update it and

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,650
do anything it just magically went from

00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,120
speaking English to speaking English and

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,620
Swedish and this is magical right and I

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,740
mean if we talk about computing power

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,450
this phone that I have today is more

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,030
powerful than my laptop

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,680
years ago in every possible way the

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,780
screen is better the camera is I don't

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,310
even think my laptop had a camera but

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,860
but you know the battery is better the

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,640
the CPU is better there everything is

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,330
better right

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,000
so in this 10 years we've gone from

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:28,690
science fiction to reality and you know

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,710
this this almost can happen right you

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,320
know nowadays when you plug something

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,080
into Linux computer it almost always

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,370
works you know it's just rarely that you

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,690
have to download some weird driver

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,250
somewhere and you know configure

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,100
something most of the times it just

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,230
works out of the box right and of course

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,930
two weeks ago they launched self-driving

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,970
buses in Sweden first in Europe or still

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,410
they tell me and and you know the first

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,390
thing that you strike you when you go

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,640
this is that they're not self-driving

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,650
self-driving because there's a driver in

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,060
them and you know whenever it hits

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,430
something you know it doesn't expect

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,620
like someone parking a bike next to the

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,260
road it just stops and goes beep beep

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,480
beep beep beep and then the driver has

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,160
to go and drive around the bus and we're

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,650
sort of drive around the bike and then

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,180
the bus can continue right and and if

00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,950
you actually look at it it's it's not

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,220
even a bus either right it's just an

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:21,760
weird yellow or painted car right with

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,850
with bus doors so so even that is sad

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,350
right but but still you know this is

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,680
self-driving cars on the streets in

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,830
Sweden ish right and you know we even

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,840
have flying cars now when I imagine

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,210
flying cars I was imagining something

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,240
slightly more practical but you know

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,700
kudos for making it a bloody convertible

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,250
car in space that's way more ambitious

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,050
than having like you say a flying car

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,050
online on the ground which which you

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,910
could actually use right and it's not

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,860
just technology that's changed in these

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,300
Taine's 10 years I mean 10 years ago

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,700
when I wanted to watch a movie

00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,530
I had to import it from the US then I

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,170
realized that my DVD player couldn't

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,970
play it because of regional encodings so

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,710
I had to download it on Pirate Bay and

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,240
then I realized that the format was

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,460
wrong so I had to convert it to some

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,710
other format and then copy it off to my

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,850
big chunky computer that was connected

00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,740
to my television and all this took a lot

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,080
of time and you know nowadays I can just

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,260
watch things on Netflix with a click of

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,570
a button right and then I

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,790
the show is not on Netflix I had to get

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,530
an HBO subscription and then you quickly

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,790
realized that it's not on HBO either so

00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,590
you have to get another subscription and

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,000
another subscription and eventually you

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,520
have all of the subscription right so

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,680
we've changed how we consume things

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,630
right and if we look at monitoring 10

00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,310
years ago what were we doing well we

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,990
were configuring thresholds we were

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,630
configuring bounds you know we were

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,430
setting up alerts and and if I look at

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,860
monitoring today what I'm doing is

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,130
essentially configuring bounds setting

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,170
thresholds setting up alerts so so while

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,230
you know some things have gone from

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,540
science fiction to reality monitoring

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,820
seems to have gone from over there to

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,550
over there you know we haven't had this

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,260
drastic change that we've had in the

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,810
rest of or ever I would say the rest but

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,720
in many parts of the industry we haven't

00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,700
gone from you know science fiction to

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,190
reality we are not living in a world of

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,920
magic we are living in the same world

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,300
where we live 10 years ago and that's

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,660
pretty much what I'm gonna talk about

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,090
here so I've always had a soft spot for

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,460
not years mainly because they're inept

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,500
windows supports has loved me to have my

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,500
Ennis client thing going for the past 10

00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,750
years or so but you know 10 years ago

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,650
now jaws was an old system it was

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,270
outdated

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,500
it was sort of long and for the next

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,420
version right when they were going to

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,580
fix all the quirks and issues so ten

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,800
years ago ish I was at the conference in

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,470
Sweden where Ethan was giving a keynote

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,260
and of course after the keynote Ethan

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,000
was at the Q&A session and the first

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,700
question he was asked was you know

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,350
what's the next big thing for nagi us

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,900
you know what's gonna happen in the next

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,310
24 months and of course you know he goes

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,370
like you know I'm never gonna give you

00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,360
up I'm never gonna let you down no he

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,490
took it in a slightly different

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,820
direction because what he said was that

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,190
Nagios is feature complete and that was

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,230
a huge blow to my stomach because all of

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,720
the stuff you know I wanted I realized

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,820
was never gonna happen and this was

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,660
really sad and for me this is when

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:29,420
Naja's died the exact date and you know

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,550
demise scenarios can be debated but

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,220
ultimately this is when I started to see

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,970
the cracks this is when I started to see

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,060
that now

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,319
was not the future and of course you

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,829
could see that you know the community

00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:45,110
was starting to fracture you could see

00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:47,389
that you know all of the problems that

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,160
Neos had it was being solved elsewhere

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,709
we had more gehrman for the scalability

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,209
issues we had a Dodgers and throk for

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,430
the web interface in a penis

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,170
we had an Camille MK live status and

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,050
whole bunch of these add-ons were you

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,970
not duct tape things onto nodules to be

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,980
able to use it in the next generation

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,290
but all of these things you really have

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,089
gone into nodules but the problem here

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,709
was that things weren't going into

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,290
knowledge us it was no road map there

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:15,829
was no next version because now just was

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:18,470
feature complete right and for me this

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:21,009
was always you know when things went you

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,360
know from awesome to not so awesome

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:25,699
of course this is when we had all the

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,970
Forks right then you know the a senior

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:30,379
one is obviously the most famous but

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,930
shinken was probably the first one right

00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:34,009
and when Chung garbs came around and

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,050
said hey you know we're gonna rewrite

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,149
nowadays in Python it's gonna be more

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,000
performant I was like seriously really

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:42,829
stupid as a dumb best idea ever

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
you know how could rewriting something

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,339
in another language make it better and

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:51,529
and Python seriously that's like the

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:53,629
worst language ever and the sad thing is

00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:56,059
that he was right and I was wrong it's

00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,879
not about the language it's about the

00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:01,040
vision the the thriving community you

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,300
know the that there is a next version

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,429
there's gonna be new things coming

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,799
that's what is important the language

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,870
doesn't matter and I mean shinken is

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,250
still around not just technically it's

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,079
also still around but but it's not

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,730
happening much right and then we

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,439
obviously had the icinga one which was

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,039
the bloody fork we had Neiman when

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,959
andreas Erik song tried to sort of do

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,850
something with nodules which ultimately

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,439
I wouldn't say failed but it didn't

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,110
become the next big nodules

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,350
but you know for me nah just really died

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,820
on when I was doing that Q&A session

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,159
when he said nah G us his feature

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,690
completes but the irony here is that

00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:38,240
Naja's is not dead you know because

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,130
every single company you go to they

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,289
still use nodules in some form or shape

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:44,570
you know you can go to like one of those

00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:47,270
hipster unicorn companies and they're

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,530
using nodules I go like why because and

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,740
they're like yeah you know it's

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,250
it works and and that's really the irony

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,840
here because not just could have been

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,710
really awesome if you know we hadn't

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:02,600
given up on it so why was nod you're so

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,340
awesome you know ten years ago why was

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,890
it awesome because as I said you know

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,800
the UI was crappy you know it had a lot

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,420
of issues configuration files that you

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,910
know was difficult to parse difficult to

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:18,260
update difficult to maintain right and

00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,280
you couldn't reload the configuration

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,320
without restarting things no UI for

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,180
updating things so you had to use the

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,220
configuration files and you know all of

00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,810
these clunky stuff but on the other side

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,970
you had all this cool stuff right it

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,100
worked you know it did its job you know

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,190
it monitored pretty much everything you

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,330
had and if it didn't monitor whatever

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,000
you had you could always write the

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,490
scripts for it and it was the de facto

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,810
standard so they were like thousands of

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,130
plugins work well I don't know I'm

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,190
counting them but there were many

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,780
plugins and also had this you know 3d

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,090
view you could you know open up and

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,130
people go like wow that's awesome I want

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,920
it I don't need it for anything I just

00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,690
want it because it's awesome but you

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,950
know if you open up the box and you look

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,560
inside essentially what you have is

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,450
Chrome I mean every five minutes we go

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,190
out and run a script if that script

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,140
returns something else than zero we send

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,240
an email that's pretty much not yes

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,460
right I mean you could you could do this

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,950
with you know 30 lines of shell script

00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,030
and you know some duct tape but still

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:22,670
you know it works right of course the

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,170
core feature of Nagios is to check even

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,270
if you just want to graph you know the

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,550
performance metrics or the something you

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,840
still need to run a check right so there

00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,340
were a lot of these where you checked

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,380
something and you set the bound to like

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,030
4 billion because you just wanted to

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,670
have the graph and you didn't want to

00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,230
get an alert of course the graphs were

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,450
always kind of tucked on the decide

00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:43,040
because there were no names no support

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,450
for graphs analogous you just had the

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,100
performance data which you could log off

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,440
somewhere and then someone else did a

00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,600
graphing fight but still your had graphs

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,270
and of course you know for the for the

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,910
hipsters you had word for SNMP J max W

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,430
mi and in all this other stuff as well

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,490
and people weren't like we don't want

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,070
that we want scripts they're awesome

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:09,169
because checks are

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:10,129
right checks are simple checks are easy

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,259
you know

00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:14,570
you can read a script you can understand

00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,100
it you can reason about it you can run

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,559
it locally to figure out what it does

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,350
you can modify it you know it's easy to

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,629
work with checks and you know once you

00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,039
actually have something that you're you

00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:26,690
know doing you can just put it into

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,730
nodules and it's happening automatically

00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,679
so it's very easy to go in from I know

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,330
on a monitor this to something that

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,039
actually works but I mean the big

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,749
problem here is not writing the script

00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:39,139
the big problem here is figuring out how

00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:41,509
and when something's broken because

00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,609
somehow you need to understand that this

00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:45,830
thing you have how do I know when it's

00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,629
broken and obviously if it's something

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,639
you have written you know that but you

00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:52,340
know when you just got some stuff thrown

00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:54,169
across the fence you'll be like no clue

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,299
what this is so the first thing you do

00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,039
is obviously go to google and then you

00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,359
google for like you know Oracle database

00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,039
how do I monitor it or something like

00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,200
that then you find like 25 different

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,960
scripts that sounds like they came to do

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,369
the same thing and then you download a

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,419
couple of them and you start them out in

00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:10,190
realized you need to install some

00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:12,080
drivers and then you need to have some

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,149
you know s a password and you have no

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,529
idea what that is and you know you go to

00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:17,899
your DBA and he's like you know you're

00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:19,489
not getting the SA password and you say

00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,600
but I have none needed for monitoring so

00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,210
you're not getting it so you get your

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,909
boss to ask and then finally you get the

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,289
password and then you you know you run

00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,580
the command and you can connect they're

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,200
like so how am I gonna monitor this

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,049
thing I'm no clue or the tablespaces

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,940
it's just something do I need to monitor

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,710
it I don't know a lot of people they

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,629
monitor the tablespaces but most people

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,889
haven't said to alter extend so

00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:41,299
essentially what you're monitoring is

00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:43,700
that Oracle does not have a bug in the

00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:45,080
old extension feature of their database

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,909
which is a good thing because there are

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,399
bugs in your can database but just don't

00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:53,029
maybe the best place to monitor them but

00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:54,649
but this understanding you need for to

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,960
do some monitoring it's actually the

00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:59,210
difficult part right it's not no tacking

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,679
some scripts together it's no wing hull

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:03,619
to monitor something that's difficult

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,090
and that is difficult that's not going

00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,249
to go away because you can you know

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,899
download scripts or because you get you

00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:11,539
know the your monitoring solution

00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:13,340
rewritten in Python you know the the

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,590
monitoring thing is still the difficulty

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,340
now if we sort of flip this around and

00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,320
go ten year

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,659
into the future what we have is this you

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,850
know graphs overlaid on maps graphs

00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,470
overlaid on graphs graphs overlaid on

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,539
graphs which are overlaid on other

00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,090
graphs which are overlaid on color-coded

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,610
boxes right I mean it's it's awesome and

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:37,760
it's in dark mode so you know it's

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:39,320
awesome I even have my dark mode shirt

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,520
on so you're gonna know that I'm awesome

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,740
right and that's what we have now does

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,000
you know dark mode UI we have pretty

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,429
graphs and it looks really really

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,990
professional but you know underneath it

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:53,929
what we really have are you know weird

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,450
config files you have to restart the

00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:59,480
agent to you know change the

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,640
configuration there is no web UI to edit

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,350
this configuration but you can always

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,820
sort of work around this by saying that

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,529
no but I don't want to edit my

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,230
configuration in the UI anyway because I

00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:11,450
want to have it in get yeah you may be

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,429
maybe not the password myth but but the

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,890
other bits but but still you know it's

00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:17,630
it's always the same right because we

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,750
have the same problem with Nadia's and

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,100
we solved them the same way right but if

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,070
you look at a lot of these modern tool

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,960
you get things like this it's super

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,850
awesome because people you go like wow I

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,409
won't have that I don't need it for

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,880
anything I just want to have it because

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,100
it's cool right

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,720
but you know ultimately they work they

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,730
collect metrics and you can do things

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,770
with them right and if we sort of open

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,990
up the box of the modern tools we will

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,909
find essentially chrome you know every

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,399
five minutes or a second it is nowadays

00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:48,470
they go out and scrape some HTTP

00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:49,909
endpoint fetch some data you know if the

00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,350
data czar bigger or smaller than a

00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:53,390
certain number we send off an email or

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:58,190
you could do this with you know shell

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:59,929
scripting curl in ten minutes right so

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,270
ultimately we haven't changed that much

00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:05,240
right and you know we know that metrics

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:05,840
is the you know core feature of these

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,789
new tools

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,950
it's the first-class citizen if you will

00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:11,419
and of course we know that metrics are

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,380
awesome because they never lie and

00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:17,390
graphs are awesome but ultimately graphs

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,279
and metrics are not going to wake you up

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,440
at four o'clock in the morning so we

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,970
need some sort of alerting and then you

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,399
end up with this alerting thing that's

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,960
just tacked on at the end where you have

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,020
that weird syntax and you can you know

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,320
maybe figure out how to get the alert

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,690
and

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,240
it's kind of wonky but you know it works

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:37,640
it's there and you can use it now the

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,430
reason why we switched metrics from

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,290
checks is because it's easy to

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,850
understand metrics you can just you know

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,490
do curl on an endpoint then you get a

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,990
whole bunch of numbers and it's easy to

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,310
understand because it's a number right

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,780
and you have a description and you can

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,240
even get some help text in there if you

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,740
want so all of this is super awesome and

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,750
it's easy for developers to add new

00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,720
metrics it's easy to understand them to

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,310
reason about them but you know the real

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,850
problem is not getting a metric in or

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,650
out

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,690
the real problem is really you know

00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:09,170
figuring out which metrics to monitor

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,250
and why because ultimately if you go and

00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,650
look at your metrics you will have

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,650
thousands of them and knowing which

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,450
metrics to to use for what purposes and

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:19,610
when is really the difficult thing here

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,750
right so what you do then when you end

00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,400
up in this scenario well you could

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,140
Google because Google has all the

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,880
answers for you and you Google you know

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,170
how do I monitor something and what you

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,020
will usually end up on this you know

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,660
Google's golden signals or you know the

00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,220
use method or the read method or you

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,960
know whatever acronym they came

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,220
up with but essentially what they're

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,320
telling you is you know if your monitor

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,760
the latency you know the error rates and

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,950
the traffic and that kind of stuff of

00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,710
your HTTP endpoint you know everything

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,330
is fine and then you're thinking yeah

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,970
but I don't have an HTTP service I'm

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,710
gonna monitor my main server and they go

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,930
like yeah well there's probably a

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,770
similar metric you can use you can

00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:59,360
always look at the list right and you

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:02,990
know that's really the problem you know

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,750
finding out which metrics use and of

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,400
course someone will eventually go ask

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,270
yourself you know what does this number

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:14,030
actually mean and you'll be like yeah

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:17,210
it's like the requests per sack maybe

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:20,660
it's Bill is my yeah it's something

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,760
requests something and they go but yeah

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,630
but but you know I have 25 here why do

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,820
you have 36 yeah because my system is

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,250
better than yours

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,230
and understanding what all of these

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,090
metrics are is is difficult unless

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:38,930
you're written the software yourself

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:41,150
right which usually haven't and then

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,200
once you've sort of glanced off the fact

00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,440
that you have no clue what you're

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,730
monitoring

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,830
you end up with the fact that

00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,710
mathematics are actually not simple

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,750
because averages are not always what you

00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,070
expect them to be but the good thing

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,409
here is that you usually start out with

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,850
average response time and then you have

00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:59,159
like five servers so you take the

00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,509
average of the average response time and

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,070
then you put that in a graph which means

00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:03,899
that you're essentially displaying the

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,230
average of the average of the average

00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:08,730
and for those who don't follow this

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,159
mathematically an average of an average

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,399
is absolutely nothing it's like saying I

00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,740
have four cores and the two sodas what's

00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,690
the average of that and mathematically

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,159
you will absolutely get a value but it

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,049
will have no meaning there will be no

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,690
sense to this because you can't do an

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,220
average of an average mathematically so

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,860
what you usually end up with in all of

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,200
these graphs is essentially nonsense

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,120
it's nonsense that has some sort of

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,789
bearing and some sort of meaning to your

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,340
system because when the nonsense changes

00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,379
from this to this you know that

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,299
something has changed right but the

00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:44,519
values in themselves have no bearing

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,500
they have no meaning and you can't

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,970
really make sense from them so it's very

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,190
difficult to say that you know when this

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,019
value goes about this threshold that

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,419
means something because the value itself

00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:56,100
doesn't need anything and you know once

00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,450
you've sort of realized that the fact

00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,549
that you know that the average response

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,850
time is good doesn't help the guy

00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:05,370
drowning you can sort of get into the

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,750
next hurdle and that's the fact that you

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,429
don't have one system you're going to

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,019
monitor because you usually have you

00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:12,240
know a load balancer you have an ingress

00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,009
proxy you have an HTTP server you have

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,110
an application you have some middleware

00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,159
you had a database and then you realize

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,659
the fact that the only way we can

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,220
monitor all these together is if we have

00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,440
some sort of dimensional structure you

00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,690
know if we say that the name here means

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,250
something all the way to here and then

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,990
you need to sit down and sort of come up

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,490
with some way to figure out how you're

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,019
going to structure all your dimensions

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,629
across all your infrastructure and

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,840
that's also kind of difficult because

00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:38,639
you have usually some sort of cloud

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,679
infrastructure nowadays that says that

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:42,750
this is the way we call the metric these

00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,909
are our dimensions and then you have

00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,500
some custom infrastructure that maybe

00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:48,240
doesn't it there too those rules and

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,580
then you end up with know somewhere here

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,200
right where you know you've gone from

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,809
it's really difficult to do monitoring

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,860
with scripts to it's really difficult to

00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:58,930
do monitoring with metrics

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,640
and we haven't really solved the

00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,140
problems right you know when when the

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,150
other things you know when ten years

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,940
into the future we can awesome right

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:09,010
monitoring just went from checks to

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:15,790
metrics we went from you know one

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:18,700
language to another and the reason why

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,070
this is is because of this and this is

00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,440
why I blame Netflix and it's not Netflix

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,390
per se it's that all of these DevOps guy

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,950
wanted monitoring and they came along

00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,660
and they said no hey we're gonna do

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,490
DevOps we're gonna do monitoring our way

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,020
we don't want to have Nagas we want to

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,810
have our monitoring tools we want to

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,430
have our ways and you know I'm not

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,170
saying ultimately that they're wrong I

00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,770
mean the new tools are fine and they

00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:43,630
work really well right but they just

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,220
reinvented everything they took na juice

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:49,270
and they rewrote it in their language

00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,920
right and that's not necessarily Netflix

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,780
for the ubers fault or some other

00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,060
hipster company it's the fact that

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,340
Nadia's died and there was no next

00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,740
version so it's ultimately Nadia's own

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,900
fault that Nadia's demised but the sad

00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,820
thing is that instead of building on top

00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,210
of what we had we built something

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,610
completely new by on the side so instead

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,250
of flying cars we got electric cars that

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,230
looks like they can fly right and and

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,090
I'm not I'm not bashing electric cars

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,580
they're super awesome but they're not

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,200
flying cars they don't solve the

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,630
congestion problem because an electric

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,980
cars take up the exact same space as a

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:28,480
regular gasoline car they don't solve

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,040
the environmental problem because

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,220
essentially we're moving off of gasoline

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:35,190
to coal power and artists you know the

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,780
same amount of fossil fuel release right

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,610
so instead of you know all of these

00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,350
awesome new monitoring solutions we

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,660
essentially got you know awesome new

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:45,960
monitoring solutions we read lingo where

00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,370
you know we had C++ and Python before

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,040
and if you look at monitoring you'll see

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,320
that it's very reflective of the era and

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,030
the people who are building it first we

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,470
had these guys who wanted monitoring and

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,060
they loved standards you know they

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,130
probably have a standards for doing

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,970
their standards because half of them are

00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,590
called the same right but but if there's

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,330
anything they love except for standards

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,910
these numbers and dots you know it's

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,750
like 802 dot eleven there has to be

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,190
doffed in it right

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,380
so what monitoring do you think these

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,090
guys come up with well of course it has

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,669
a lot of numbers and dots in them right

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,909
I mean it's it's the only way it could

00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:23,320
be and I'm not saying it's bad I'm just

00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:25,419
saying it's very reflective of the

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,340
people and the tools were impossibly

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,080
complicated you need it to be certified

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,510
to use them just like you have to be

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,100
certified to use the router right so all

00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,809
of this we sort of built up by the

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,900
people who were needing the monitoring

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,429
and then these guys comes along and you

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,870
know they spent their entire lives

00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:42,820
writing scripts right and you know

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,309
shoehorning things together and using a

00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:46,840
lot of duct tape and the c s-- admins

00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:48,909
when they came along their monitoring

00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,500
were based on scripts right because

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,610
that's how they work and that's what

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,080
they do right it's what's easy for them

00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,120
and then if we look at you know the next

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,039
generation monitoring we had these guys

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,360
you know who were building applications

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,490
who came in and you know wrote they're

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,409
monitoring so of course their monitoring

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,580
is going to be based on 3d graphs and

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:11,950
nice you eyes and cool dark themes right

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,750
but it hasn't really change how we do

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,429
monitoring you know back in the SNMP

00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,659
days you know we still had chrome

00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,890
running every X minute fetching data

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,270
checking it and then comparing it to

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,789
whatever it should be and then we sent

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,130
off an email in nodules we have nodules

00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:29,679
running scripts every X minutes and

00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,870
sending off the email alert and nowadays

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,330
we have Prometheus fetching metrics from

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,880
rest endpoints every X minutes sending

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,940
off alerts right so it kind of works the

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,919
same as it has for not the past 10 years

00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,539
but more like the past 40 years or

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,730
something like that I have no clue when

00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:49,120
SNMP was invented way before my time

00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:50,650
it's too difficult for me so what I'm

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,690
saying is that you know if we want the

00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,880
next generation monitoring to be the

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:56,950
flying car and not just the car that

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,470
looks like it can fly we need to think

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,990
about this differently we need to you

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,789
know not rewrite it in some other fancy

00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,500
language we need to actually think about

00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:08,080
the problems we're having and try to

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,620
solve them monitoring is not about

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,600
checks

00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,250
it's not about metrics and it's not even

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,950
about logs it's about all of them

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,360
together right we need to use metrics we

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,070
need to use tracks and we need to use

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,039
logs and we also need to use things like

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:24,160
events or SNMP traps as they will call

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,200
back in the SNMP days because all

00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,270
these together is what forms the vision

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,620
of things like and these tools shouldn't

00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,270
be you know something you put a lot of

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,900
duct tape around and you know somehow

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,220
get together like a lot of you know the

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,810
enterprise package monitoring solution

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,900
that just she won't see in an elk stack

00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:43,450
because then they get logs as well

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,190
that's not really what we need we need a

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,680
solution that actually can look at all

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,260
of these right and we also need a way to

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,480
communicate with our monitoring soon so

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:56,290
that we can figure out when we get this

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,720
metric what is the unit is it seconds or

00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,250
microseconds or milliseconds we should

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,440
be able to know this right the tools

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,580
should be able to detect this but but

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,780
more importantly the tools should be

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,160
able to say that hey you know we're

00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,720
monitoring things in milliseconds here

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,300
can you give me this metric in

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,380
milliseconds instead of seconds and you

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,300
know they should be able to do this

00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,950
without me configuring it they should be

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,410
able to do this by talking but

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,880
communicating right and then we have the

00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,860
things like we're sending averages

00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,300
everywhere because it's easy we should

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,830
send histograms everywhere because

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,860
that's truth or that's more truth than

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,419
averages but to do that then we need to

00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,610
have this communication in place because

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,070
histograms require some sort of upfront

00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,419
configuration so the monitoring tools

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,169
need to be able to tell the client that

00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,060
hey you know I want to have the

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:39,490
histograms with this bucket size because

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,500
that's what no 2 3 & 4 is sending me

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,210
you shouldn't have to configure all this

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,669
by yourself and you should be able to

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,669
take the average response time of your 5

00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:50,950
server cluster it shouldn't be something

00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,990
you have to do by hand or just you know

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,090
let's hope the averages are kind of the

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,670
same as long as the load balancer is is

00:34:55,090 --> 00:35:00,070
equal right and then of course you know

00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,070
all of these metric names we need some

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,170
sort of standard to get them to be

00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,780
together right so I know what this

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,940
metric mean you know a way to move my

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,070
dashboard from one system to the other a

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,810
way that I can share this dashboard with

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,180
other people without having to tell them

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,400
you know yeah grab some metrics and put

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,840
them yourself in the dashboard but but

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,880
nowadays when you have you know going

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,500
from one team to another they're naming

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,180
schemes for their metrics is completely

00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,980
different when you're moving from one

00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,330
cloud provider to another all the

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,970
metrics will be renamed right

00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,400
there's no way to build a solution that

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,380
works in all these settings except hand

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,720
tailoring t'en to all these settings and

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,050
of course you know in the SNMP world we

00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,110
have

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:42,760
naming schemes so essentially what I'm

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,950
trying to tell you here is that the

00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,950
monitoring solution of the future is

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:51,640
SNMP because that takes all the boxes

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,900
right and before I'm loose I'm

00:35:51,640 --> 00:36:01,050
essentially going to say thank you for

00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:06,119
listening then that was all I had

00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:06,119
[Applause]

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,599
so we have still some time for questions

00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:17,720
what questions can Michael answer for

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,720
you

00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:23,339
anyone oh really you didn't get the

00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:24,930
whole dumb thing you know it sure it's

00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:32,549
gonna be fake media if it's a bad

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:35,160
question yeah when will you implement an

00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:39,180
SNMP agent in an his client plus plus so

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:43,549
we get rid of this funny you asked that

00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,549
have you looked at the latest version no

00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:54,030
hopefully never but you never know any

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,740
other questions it just as a quick

00:36:54,030 --> 00:37:03,140
reference is Anna's client feature

00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:03,140
complete no it never will be

00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:10,740
so anyone else Michael what is the next

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,539
big thing for Anna's clan yeah I know

00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:16,859
it's featured no well I was kind of

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,319
asked that question a while back yeah

00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,309
I've seen a couple of minutes back and I

00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,109
started to build a new web interface in

00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:28,230
angular2 it will set the time now it's

00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:30,089
force 825 no no version changes quickly

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,079
and and unfortunately angler is like the

00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:35,549
worst thing ever so I've spent hours no

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,020
it's like weeks and weeks and weeks

00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:40,770
trying to get this web interface to

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:43,069
actually work and I've failed us for so

00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,450
once that's done then I'm gonna focus on

00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:48,480
two things essentially it's gonna be dr.

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:51,260
sport and Prometheus so that's pretty

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,760
much the next two things on the agenda

00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,930
alright Michael thank you very much for

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,579
being here it's always great to have you

00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:01,250
here thank you you have a small present

00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:02,810
for you is it maybe

00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:10,110
thank you

00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:21,959
[Applause]
