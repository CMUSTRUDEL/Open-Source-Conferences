Title: OSMC 2018 | Eliminating Alerts or “Operation Forest” by Rihards Olups
Publication date: 2018-11-19
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Our goal is to eliminate alerts and a common mantra is “alert only if absolutely needed”. But that’s only for the monitoring-related people, whereas it seems as if the mantra for others is “whatever”. Excessive alerts are like Stephen King’s Langoliers – they eat our time. Decommissioned servers, flapping alerts, mysterious emails.
Let’s bring on “Operation Forest” and see what – and even more importantly, how – can be done about that. The monitoring tool You choose is just a part of the solution. What good is your tool if nobody pays attention to it?
We’ll talk about the usage of weapons like Terminology, Persistence and Involvement, as well as CommonSense and Policy as potential problem-solvers. Case studies (aka anecdotal examples) will be brought forward to illustrate ways alerts can become useless, be ignored and lead to serious outage.
