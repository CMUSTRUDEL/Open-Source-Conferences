Title: OSMC 2018 | Eliminating Alerts or “Operation Forest” by Rihards Olups
Publication date: 2018-11-19
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Our goal is to eliminate alerts and a common mantra is “alert only if absolutely needed”. But that’s only for the monitoring-related people, whereas it seems as if the mantra for others is “whatever”. Excessive alerts are like Stephen King’s Langoliers – they eat our time. Decommissioned servers, flapping alerts, mysterious emails.
Let’s bring on “Operation Forest” and see what – and even more importantly, how – can be done about that. The monitoring tool You choose is just a part of the solution. What good is your tool if nobody pays attention to it?
We’ll talk about the usage of weapons like Terminology, Persistence and Involvement, as well as CommonSense and Policy as potential problem-solvers. Case studies (aka anecdotal examples) will be brought forward to illustrate ways alerts can become useless, be ignored and lead to serious outage.
Also find out: what’s “Operation Forest”.

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,789
my name is Lee Hertz and today I'll try

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,070
to tell you a story I'm not much of an

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,680
artist this might be obvious here so I

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,119
did my best at Birds other people draw

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,119
much better Birds this is mine

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,120
disclaimers first no views are endorsed

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,530
by any employers past or present and any

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,879
resemblance whatsoever to real-life

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,010
entities is completely kind so dental

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,629
the storyteller today is has been

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,570
involved monitoring for about 20 years

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,879
as out of these the twenty has worked at

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,850
zabbix for six years is a bit addicted

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,780
to OpenStreetMap mapping so that's my

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,559
hobby I'm a tea drinker I take my normal

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,180
size D mug to D conferences people

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,010
usually ask whether there's beer or

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,820
gerak or some other drink this has not

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,920
seen anything alcoholic its Fritz forty

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,720
now with that whole out of the way we

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,659
can dive into the story right there in

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,150
the chapter one this is a story about a

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,340
single day in on-call life where a

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,470
product the protagonist me has joined

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,220
the new team and this is my first on

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,430
call it starts on a Friday so in the

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,700
very morning I'm starting my uncle they

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,040
fresh full with force and their subtitle

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,090
for this one is how I understood that

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,850
alerts are bad I start at 10 o'clock

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,479
because I'm not an early bird and on

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,570
this Friday I start very open eyed and I

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,490
go by the thinking that alerts are good

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,840
because they are informing us and alerts

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,640
are always useful because this is a

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,560
great team so all of the alerts that I

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,469
received they have perfect information

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,869
everything will be peachy excitement

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,630
First Alert has arrived and I'm starting

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,060
to look into the problem but a minute

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,190
later I get an email from a somebody

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,050
working on a system saying that they

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,150
just didn't think monitoring would pick

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,690
it up so they didn't put that system in

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,020
maintainer

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,810
didn't silence it the enthusiasm has

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,220
slightly dropped but not completely yet

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:25,080
so I'm still keeping my strength on this

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,640
then another alert arrives this time

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,590
somebody else responds that well it's

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,450
actually a system which hasn't been used

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,460
we just didn't properly remove it from

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,640
the environment so it somehow came back

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,350
and alerted you in a way this alert was

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,150
not the worst one we found out that one

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,140
system was not properly removed but I

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,750
was not that excited anymore another

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,880
alert this time the response was that

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,800
well yeah it alerted but actually the

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,390
values are kind of okay so we'll just

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,150
ignore it

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,800
and I had this vision that that if I

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,100
would go and tell people that we should

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,380
not have alerts like this it's almost

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,840
like seeing people poking their armpits

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,370
with nails so I spend a week convincing

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,920
them that's it's it's painful it's not

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,750
very useful and they go oh yeah great

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,160
and then you know the next day I would

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,780
see them but that day you'll stick in

00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,330
alder there I so I try to think of is it

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,920
always that bad actually these habits

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,230
were the alerts are ignored and maybe

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,760
not always there are these

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,400
unconventional habits that might seem

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,610
strange from the outside but that might

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,380
have these cases where they are not the

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,870
they're actually proving to have some

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,630
use for example in Burma now Myanmar

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,940
there's a Pathan Chi and tribe which

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,570
probably people have heard of because

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,130
when these tribes they had to move to

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,050
other countries live in refugee camps

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,310
this was the only tribe which was

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,120
actually economically self-sufficient

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,100
from tourism so this uncommon habit

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,580
turned out to have a positive effect at

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,010
some point during their their their

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,120
voyage to a neighboring country that's

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,290
probably not the best word for that

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,790
though strike it out so I was thinking

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,860
about starting to think about these

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,250
habits around one o'clock at that time

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,140
so I had seen some practices and I was

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,109
thinking about habits that don't seem

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:21,750
good to me to put it politely Tamar

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:25,979
triple7 probably is one I would put on

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,639
the list sudo su if somebody here is

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,139
using sudo

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,349
don't tell me I like to think that we

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,860
all here are perfect and keeping an eye

00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:36,659
on the alerts or on the metrics was

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,889
something I thought sorry to think is

00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:45,060
not a good thing so I kind of evoked in

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:49,370
myself the fire a sense of fire sense of

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,229
smoke and smoke usually produces

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,150
emotions of excitement of engagement of

00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,370
getting up doing something it's working

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,349
in the woods cooking food maybe if I'm

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,840
sitting in an office and I'm feeling

00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:03,389
there's smoke I'd probably get concerned

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,520
first time if that would repeat every

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,349
day I would get not very concerned by

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,569
the end of the month probably and that's

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:15,120
like the boy who cried wolf

00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,069
story all over again and if we had fire

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,419
alarms which did this that just like oh

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,610
we'll just ignore it today oh it's

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,879
nothing somebody just hang their coat on

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,860
the sensor or something but somehow this

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:30,990
 is accepted from the monitoring

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:34,589
systems in many environments and these

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,419
alerts they're not big in most cases but

00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:40,349
they are extremely efficient eaters of

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,479
our time so I would actually say that

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:45,710
alerts are like Langille ears if anybody

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,939
here has either read or seen the movie

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,330
or miniseries adaptation of Stephen

00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:54,599
King's story soul anglers are these

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,279
either they eat the time that's the past

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:59,009
they eat the time the space objects

00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,139
everything and I was watching that

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,849
during my childhood it was pretty scary

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,889
actually they were eating everything you

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:06,649
couldn't really run away from them so

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,149
that's like that's like alerts right

00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:12,149
they're eating my time I can't really

00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:14,550
run away from them and I was thinking

00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:16,199
that I could maybe make a plush lunga

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,969
leader and when there's somebody

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,800
responsible for useless alert that could

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,589
throw at them and then they would have

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,349
it it's like a traveling trophy in a bad

00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,029
way so if somebody else is responsible

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:30,360
for a useless alert they would be able

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:34,050
to pass it on whoever has it feels like

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,229
a bit in a bad way maybe so the

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,149
conclusion of that stretch of the day

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,470
was that actually all alerts are bad

00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,870
because I can envision too

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,300
stabilities one something bad has

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:51,180
happened or is about to happen very soon

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:54,120
or it's useless alert and to reinforce

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,090
that I try to visualize that so that

00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,720
alerts are bad inkay alerts all of them

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:06,090
those two kinds they all are bad there

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,190
are no good alerts and afternoon arrived

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,060
so we're entering Chapter two of the

00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:16,280
story in this chapter I understood a bit

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,280
more about why bad alerts happen

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,900
sometimes it's good to take a bit of a

00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:25,530
break from the work so I started reading

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,180
about the etymology an afternoon it's

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,950
defined as the time from noon or

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,750
lunchtime till evening and we usually

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,880
think of that as being twelve o'clock

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,919
but it hasn't been that case always

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,470
because the name actually comes from the

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,160
Latin word of nine which meant the ninth

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:43,440
hour that was the ninth hour Romans were

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,210
counting hours from the sunrise so

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,930
approximately the ninth hour was around

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,330
what is 3 o'clock in the afternoon but

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,580
then somewhere between twelve and forty

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,190
twelve and fourteen centuries it shifted

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,310
by three hours from three o'clock to

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,720
twelve o'clock and there's no perfect

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,860
explanation but one of the possible

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,890
reasons is that monks were fasting until

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:11,790
noon that is they were avoiding food and

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:13,979
they're probably not the most kind of

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,560
people that you think which who are like

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,660
really not eating much by the visual

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,990
image of that at least I have of them

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,600
and so the noon that's the time until

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,810
until which they were not eating shifted

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,030
by whole three hours then I went back to

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,729
work and I looked at some graphs and

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,409
alerts that were coming in and I really

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,450
loved graphs they they're good ones at

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,810
least they realize things they allow us

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,310
to see problems sooner and I started

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,229
looking at graphs that were showing the

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,720
disk space on systems which had disk

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,280
space problems unexpectedly and these

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,050
graphs they had something in common it

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,330
was just that the disk space was just

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,490
disappearing it was going somewhere and

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,470
all of them on some of them to Graham

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,820
was a bit more different and with more

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,610
interesting because it's already going

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,370
like Assaf tooth pattern and it almost

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,380
looked like the disk space runs out

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,149
somebody manually delete some files and

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,540
then it repeats and repeats and it

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:11,130
repeats again of course not all of the

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,600
graphs were this simple some of them

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,940
looked like whoa what just happened

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,470
there if this was a cardio grande attack

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,880
that the doctor would probably go like

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,770
no I'm not touching that one so these I

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,510
felt like that doctor because I was like

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,250
no I'm not touching that one I'll try to

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,620
solve the ones where it's actually going

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,950
down in an even pattern that I'll start

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,020
with those so I picked one of those

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,050
systems and I checked with the people

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,490
responsible for it and try to see what's

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,399
going on and how can we resolved

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,190
actually constant dropping of free disk

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,290
space and I received a response that

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,570
they currently don't see a disk space

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,990
issue which was correct there was more

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,520
than 40 percent of free disk space at

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:58,160
this point I recalled another movie from

00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,000
my childhood or at least younger years

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,950
probably some of you have seen a movie

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,209
were Sandra and kinu they're on a bus

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:08,190
and this bus it has a bomb and it hasn't

00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,810
it cannot slow down and they're just in

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,839
Sandra is driving probably because she's

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,730
a good driver or something and this

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,579
currently I don't see a disk space issue

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,990
looking at that graph I thought that

00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:21,060
would be like Hina going like currently

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,970
I don't see a road issue what it's free

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,680
what's the problem girl yeah so I had

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:33,480
already established for myself that all

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,520
alerts are bad but I was also starting

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,839
to get an impression that it's even

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,820
worse than that

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,370
I was started likening the alerts to

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,620
trash a trashy place will get more trash

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,930
a clean place is much less likely to get

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,700
trashed it's the same with the alerts if

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,589
there's an noisy environment there's

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,270
more alerts and then people don't feel

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:55,170
that responsible for introducing yet

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:58,130
another so alerts attract trash or trash

00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:02,070
attracts alerts something like that and

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:05,970
I thought of a forest which is clean

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,560
nice and it would be it would be less

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,140
likely to get trashed

00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,440
that's how operation forest was born

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,570
operation forest is like alerts and we

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,550
should stop trashing our forest because

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,470
we all live in it it's like throwing

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,220
trash in the office on the floor that's

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,870
like creating these alerts so trash in

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,940
the forest is bad inkay and there might

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:41,940
be somebody who is oh there's a bird in

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:44,010
the forest the same one yeah and so

00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,810
there might be somebody who says that

00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,980
well those alerts there about my systems

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,140
don't worry about that I'm responsible

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,880
about them but it's almost like saying

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,500
oh the thrash I threw in the forest

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,410
that's mine don't worry about that

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,420
so no any alerts that are there they're

00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:01,860
our collective responsibility so I was

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,530
not accepting that then looking at other

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,300
problems there was case sre

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,940
investigating I thought hey what's going

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,340
on there's this disc fo land and the

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,320
logger Kate is not working there turns

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,970
out that if this is completely full law

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,550
tort it creates an incomplete file and

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,160
then stops reading that file ever again

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,410
until it's manually cleaned up this by

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,420
the way is actually related to a

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,970
real-life entity or real-life thing

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,080
because there is a bug like that so I

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,580
figured out that not only alert

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,860
themselves are bad because they eat our

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,750
time but not paying attention to them

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,970
which is the extension of having many

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,620
alerts will lead to even more alerts so

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,850
trying to think more about what causes

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,880
the alerts of course it's the technical

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,340
challenges things like this hardware

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,410
problem the software bug and so on but

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:57,030
ultimately all of those we can work

00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:00,540
around we can try to solve but the thing

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,700
that is most the hardest to eliminate at

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,590
least for me is the human factor whether

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,210
it's lack of time whether it's the

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,290
attitude whether it's the regional

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,840
culture the organizational culture so

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,970
suddenly this seemingly technological

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,060
problem I received too many alerts or

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,190
too many or one of the alerts the

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,500
nighttime it becomes more of a human

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:25,050
problem

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,450
and that leads us into the chapter three

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,450
in the story and evening is approaching

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,340
in this chapter the protagonist tried to

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:40,200
battle the alerts and a bit of spoiler

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:43,830
didn't fully succeed yet so I tried to

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,170
think of ways to deal with the alerts

00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,670
and that we could possibly just change a

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,190
tool will change the monitoring solution

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,480
will change the alerting solution

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,890
instead of just sending the emails we'll

00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,600
have the mobile alerts SMS phone calls

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,000
that idea quickly disappeared because

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,370
people who would ignore the alerts they

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,590
would be able to ignore anything one way

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,910
or another even if we would lead cables

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,070
to their chairs and every time there's

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,320
an alert early an electric shock they

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,710
just would just start wearing a tinfoil

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,980
Underpants people who ignore problems

00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,930
they're very good at it so I dropped

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,150
this idea I figured out it's not the

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:27,210
tool it's us so I try to think of ways I

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,840
can help or I can show things that I'd

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:33,480
like to be better at and the one thing

00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,340
that always has helped me to get better

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,590
alerts is understanding what I'm running

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,960
and what and how I'm monitoring so if

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,760
there's a cash filling up I have to find

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,170
somebody who knows and cares about that

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,900
so I can figure out is that a problem

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,630
will this thing go down in a week is

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,900
this a normal pattern because if the

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,990
problems are left untouched for a very

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,760
long time it's like crash in the office

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,710
you just throw things there there's an

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,890
apple there's banana and there's that or

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,420
no mango whatever people eat and at some

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,550
point it all starts through out there

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,870
and there's new life developing maybe

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,820
and then that problem if that's the

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,620
problem right it goes around the office

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,010
and at some point just by two nests you

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,940
go like oh I didn't expect that it's the

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:23,280
same with the alerts and as extension of

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,290
the knowing what I am running and how

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,890
I'm answering it I also must know my

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,050
mom's ring solution so I must understand

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,560
it well enough to be able to run it

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,560
efficiently

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:40,600
and I recalled a case where I actually

00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,009
lost two days writing a script because I

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,370
didn't know my mom for ink solution had

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:47,230
the functionality built in I recall the

00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,420
person thinking it's funny that the

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,459
monitoring solution there's a week-long

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,319
course available for it because haha if

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,790
your monitoring solution is so complex

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,490
who needs it

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,259
but by this time I had figure out that

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,779
if a monitoring solution is so simple

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,699
you can pick it up in a day it's either

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:07,029
something that you'll have to write

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:09,129
things that yourself mostly or it will

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,079
be so impossible that you will not be

00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:16,329
able to mount or anything past the first

00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:18,009
week and then I looked at what we have

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,660
the new things that are coming into our

00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,790
environment we had new database it came

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,170
with its own monitoring tool we had you

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,809
know a scale things came with its own

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,459
monitoring tool then I read in the news

00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:29,170
that grep is coming with the monitoring

00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:32,319
tool built in it will have graphing

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,959
engine well maybe I imagined that one

00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,240
but everything now comes with its own

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,980
monitoring solution and a bigger

00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,929
environment and especially more diverse

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,600
environment will eventually have dozens

00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:46,480
of them literally dozens of monitoring

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,790
solutions that the people running them

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,559
nobody really knows them they kind of

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,420
see the graphs but if something breaks

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,160
or something is in correcting them

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:58,149
either nobody will able to fix it or

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,179
nobody will even notice it so I promise

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:03,100
to myself that I will not tell anybody

00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,720
that it doesn't matter which monitoring

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,350
solution did they choose it matters a

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,980
lot

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:11,770
but it's our choice which monitoring

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:17,250
tool we choose and I will try to pick

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:21,929
one know it and then benefit from that

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:26,169
because we can nail a screw which is

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:27,970
exhibit one here with a rock which is

00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:31,480
exhibit two here let me demonstrate that

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,740
here umm okay they will probably throw

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,250
me out for that so I'll skip that one

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,260
but you can also do that with the hammer

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,830
this is actually a hammer a pretty

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,120
expensive as well and in both cases that

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,700
is usually considered a pretty crappy

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,920
thing to do so you can take the best

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,480
monitoring tool or the simple script

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,190
you can still ignore the alerts from

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,840
them you can still make crappy things

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:59,230
with these two great tools or the bad

00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:04,990
tools if you will if another alert

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:07,480
arrived and for this one the email

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,490
response didn't already surprise me that

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,350
much because the response was that yeah

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,610
log rotate was on the server it was kind

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,110
of working but the files were not

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,090
removed so I just waited them manually

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,680
and that was it at this point I was

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,120
feeling like in some comic book and

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,850
there was this bubble coming out like

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,170
there's a pattern here this is really a

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,560
human problem this is not a

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:31,050
technological problem so I figured out

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,060
that I'll draw a schematic of our

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,860
organization and our team and what is

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,990
the thing that is wrong with our team

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:43,510
possibly and so I drew this schematic

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:47,350
and I'm not good at that drawing thing

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:53,230
but this was like a flowchart of what's

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:56,920
wrong with with the team and I put in my

00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:02,670
friend in there because it made things a

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:06,100
bit more human so I try to summarize the

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,530
important things and I fixated on one

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,450
which was that I should try to fix the

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,370
problems I promise that I'll fix the

00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,290
problems instead of just delaying them

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,820
of course unless I mean a speeding bus

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,220
with a bomb then delaying it this kids

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,290
kind of find it's I'm not gonna like say

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,630
oh I I'll just fix it now

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,700
I'll not delay it but the same applies

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,580
of course to IT if we have an emergency

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:32,440
delaying a problem is perfectly fine but

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,570
ignoring it afterwards less so and as an

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,240
extension of that and stander likes that

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,130
approach as an extension of that I

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,040
promise myself that I'll fix problems

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,230
for everybody for my team for as many

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,910
people as I can instead of just going

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,250
and fixing at them in a small

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,550
environment like for one instance or for

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,420
this group for this project I'll try to

00:19:51,550 --> 00:20:00,490
fix them at the core where they appeared

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,539
and I never thought about ways to help

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,210
with this

00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:07,149
how I can communicate that better and

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,859
one thing is having better alerts not

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:10,509
just eliminating them but also having

00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:13,149
better because that will help to

00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,129
eliminate them eventually and I recall

00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:18,159
the phrase where it seemed like somebody

00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:20,889
had set a car and sentence but and

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,899
somehow half of that was lost and then

00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,340
the internet took half of it and run

00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:27,700
away with it saying email is the worst

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,429
notification method losing the the the

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,989
context email is perfect notification

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,820
method for things where you don't need

00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:35,559
immediate attention or as a

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,479
supplementary notification when you

00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,989
receive something on your mobile device

00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:42,639
usually or your chair if you have wires

00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:47,349
then you get more information in the

00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:49,149
email usually so that's like saying that

00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:52,149
walking is the worst method to get from

00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:53,649
Europe to Americas and then somebody

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:56,679
cutting off and saying walking is the

00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:59,769
worst method to get somewhere to get

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,659
context always is important so I'm very

00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,099
much liking email so don't tell me is

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:09,879
the worst ratification method

00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:11,169
I'll get sad and cry so I promise I made

00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:14,559
to myself was that I'll work tirelessly

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,879
to improve these alerts to be them to

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,629
make them less frequent and more useful

00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:22,919
and meaningful and the way to do that is

00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:26,340
by having short concise titles obviously

00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:29,349
I'll make no typos in the instructions

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,909
because even if that typo is in the

00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,009
sentence that might just leave bad

00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:34,749
impression of me I'll get used to it

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:36,789
and I'll start making typos and

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:40,269
technical instructions like commands for

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:42,249
somebody to run if I write in a bad way

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:46,989
that will affect my thinking that will

00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:49,059
mess up my thinking eventually I also

00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:50,649
figured out that if so if I there's a

00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,019
known problem maybe a bug or a

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,519
configuration issue and I know that hey

00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,529
this will probably happen three times

00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,779
before we get the fix in and we deploy

00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:00,399
it I will add an automatic action to

00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:02,169
resolve that because I know that it'll

00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:03,909
probably happen at least thirty times if

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,999
I summated three it's like software

00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:08,349
development where you take the estimate

00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:10,210
multiplied by two and that's not

00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:12,659
including testing and documentation and

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,659
and so on

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:21,140
I received an alert which was more about

00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:23,060
my field and I thought hey that's that's

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,040
not something we can fix it's a known

00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,470
problem but it's useful to know when it

00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,410
happens so I'll keep the alert on and

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,060
then I hit myself for that thought

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,220
because monitoring is not my personal

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:36,470
task list it's not my personal reminder

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,140
if something is used if it's useful to

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,850
know that something happened then I'll

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,130
make I'll make it log it somewhere and

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,860
if it's really useful I can take a look

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:47,270
at that log later and when that is done

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,500
usually nobody looks at those logs

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:54,140
because it turns out it's actually not

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:56,000
that important or even interesting after

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,060
spending this it was already somewhere

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,710
deep in the night spending this time I

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,340
thought hey maybe I'm just imagining all

00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:07,760
this maybe we don't have a large problem

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,130
and there I saw the alerts but I wasn't

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,980
sure what's were they coming from and

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:15,670
how they are spread out is it really a

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,290
problem or is it just a huge environment

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,850
so I wrote a few scripts and I was glad

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,280
I was using a pretty open monitoring

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,460
solution to be able to do that and I was

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,880
generating reports more extensive than

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,620
available built in and I proved I was

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,950
able to prove to myself that yes we have

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,270
a problem with the alerts and I promise

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:42,380
that I will also share this information

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:45,110
with the team then the team was going to

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,340
adapt all new material mythology's well

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:51,440
all new at that time and I try to see a

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,080
look up in the dictionary what's agile

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,450
and I found something that oh I'll not

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,250
have to maintain that and then for dev

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,860
observers Oh everything goes in

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,200
production and yes before you Lynch me

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,970
that's all completely misunderstood

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,210
that's not how it's supposed to be and

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,970
yes the second one of course as well

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,740
both of these had super great visions

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,250
and then it's now it's like framework

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,290
this

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,050
scalable that and it's all a bit

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,640
different but there's of course a chance

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,070
for all of us to take the good things

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,730
out of this and that is monitoring your

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:27,830
lated this is sort of a common knowledge

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,970
by then but still almost nobody does it

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,710
on a large scale

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,590
bringing the developers in on the

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,299
monitoring so I decided to every time

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,340
there's somebody at least briefly

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,380
interested in monitoring I'll try to get

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,049
them access to all the monitoring I can

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,200
I'll try to put all the problems in

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:49,730
front of as many people as I can as soon

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,530
as I can and then I quickly hacked a way

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,450
to put all the current problems on a

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,010
system and message of the day so if

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,620
somebody lives on a server day level

00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,230
like blast these are the problems even

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,150
the ones that are not alerting to the

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,100
mobile devices for everybody so if

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,080
there's a problem which is just the

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,730
long-term problem if you see that every

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,770
day in the message of the day you might

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,929
be more likely to fix it well that was

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:14,840
my thinking possibly it might grow

00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:16,429
people and to use news to the problem so

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,020
they'll go like oh that's normal and if

00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:23,510
it disappears they get alerted this idea

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,000
borrowed from Ilya from company Badu

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:31,640
so he's the one championing it I can

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,890
borrowed the idea as I had worked for

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,630
quite a few hours by now I was thinking

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,490
also about broiler topics and one of

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,740
those was reading the Wikipedia page

00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:42,740
about how language shapes perception of

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,740
reality and how it disputed this way

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,620
that way and this way but there was a

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,370
thing I learned from a wise man which

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,630
was that language matters in the

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,770
technical teams in very specific

00:25:53,630 --> 00:26:02,809
occurrences word false another Latin

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:04,580
word for whatever and the wisdom was

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:08,000
that we should never ever say false

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,980
positive miss configuration of the

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,289
monitoring system for example it's never

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,090
a false positive if somebody utters

00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:17,210
those words the first thing that should

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,039
happen is don't use them the the

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,990
conversation should stop the words

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,179
should be erased from everybody's memory

00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,919
and then it can continue because what

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,380
happens is that if we say it's a POLST

00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,419
false positive the first response from

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,480
everybody is like oh well it's good here

00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:35,120
then no problem if we say it's a miss

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,830
configuration the response usually would

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,299
be like how do we fix it them and

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,550
language and the terms that we use it's

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,980
a very good topic

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:48,330
this one an IRC probably four hours so

00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,340
I'm glad to continue that discussion and

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,770
add more words or phrases not to be used

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,530
to my addiction airy talking about the

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,180
language I'm not very good with

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,750
communicating with people I tend to go

00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,460
and tell them like this is bad and in

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:07,300
different environments this can be

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,210
different turns out surprise so for

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,250
example even at the country level and at

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,610
the Continental level even some of the

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,470
terms phrases and how we approach and

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:21,090
tell others about the problems can work

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:23,710
or better or not that great and

00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,630
supposedly that you say word hate is

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,790
usually very has very strong

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,320
connotations as opposed to large parts

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,140
of Europe or if you say that you hate

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:37,360
useless alert that's perfectly fine

00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:39,280
and so if alerts are mostly a human

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,680
problem then I should try to convince

00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,260
people and I should try to talk in a way

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,450
that doesn't put them off right away

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,170
because if I tell this sucks and they

00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,700
wrote that I'll try to change myself to

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,910
put that in a way that is more

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,170
approachable for them actually even

00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,870
saying that there is the difference

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:04,020
possibly between Europe and USA and the

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:07,150
communication can be considered impolite

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:12,400
so I continue reading this supplementary

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:14,410
material and there was a page talking

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,170
about the possibility of a tact filter

00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,820
were sort of normal people the non geeky

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,140
people they have the outgoing tact

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,930
filter and geeks have something more

00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,910
incoming and the explanation was that

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,160
when people grow up geeks might get

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,690
picked on a bit more frequently and then

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,830
they are told well they didn't mean that

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,840
but the normal people would be usually

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,600
told try to say the nice things to

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,940
others so they develop this outgoing

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,700
tact filter and they expect things not

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,260
to be harshly put but if you are always

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,780
used to applying that filter on the

00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,000
incoming connection then you are more

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,830
okay with saying things in a harsher way

00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,059
which might be completely untrue but I

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:57,429
really like the possibility of this

00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:01,269
there's a lot of in this area that's

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:02,350
also similar for example people who

00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:04,389
learn English as a second language

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,129
usually are a bit better with spelling

00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:09,129
because that's how they learned it by

00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:11,019
reading more first not talking and

00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:13,929
native speakers are actually worse at

00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:16,059
spelling in many cases non-native

00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:19,929
speakers are also more eager to accept

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:22,149
corrections to their typos so that was a

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:23,649
thing that I was not starting to learn

00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:26,559
at that night but I figured out that

00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:29,080
I'll probably try to learn more on that

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:45,970
someday and I was pretty tired by then

00:29:29,080 --> 00:30:01,210
so I started looking at some videos the

00:29:45,970 --> 00:30:04,149
duck right so no connection to the

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,679
company so I'm not receiving anything

00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:07,360
from them but I really like the video

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,600
because that's what comes to my mind

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,240
when I see teams failing I think of them

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,360
like being on the ice and not having the

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,249
attitude and the equipment so they're

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,169
just slipping all over the place and

00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:23,619
there's alerts spilling and this

00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:25,480
happening and that happening so this was

00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,059
around seven o'clock in the morning or

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,649
so and I was trying to think of ways

00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,659
maybe I should start a campaign with a

00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:33,909
loud slogan maybe I could have something

00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:35,830
like make alerts meaningful again and

00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,490
the acronym would be really awesome I go

00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,139
like mama and we'd have this on red and

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,789
we would have this on red baseball caps

00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,499
and we would go and just like you know

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,869
beat up people who are not really

00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:48,580
agreeing with this then the Sun came up

00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:53,470
and I was like a hug that's a stupid

00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:57,480
idea my drawing skills had not improved

00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,330
through overnight of course so

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,840
respecting our alcohol

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:07,720
it's like respecting ourselves but this

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,679
is a very very kumbaya and polite thing

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,889
and I'm not that polite

00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:14,799
person so I'd like to leave all of us

00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:17,019
with a more upbeat attitude so when I

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,960
get mad and I get pissed I grab my pen

00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:22,659
and I write out a list anybody

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,419
recognizes that probably not but still

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:28,869
giving a chance so that's from a really

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:29,860
cool girl band l7 from a song called

00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:34,269
 list

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,429
so I wrote out it's an incomplete list

00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:39,580
it's a list where we can strike out

00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:43,169
things we do the more check boxes we

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,570
mark the more shitty our environment is

00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:49,049
and that would be all for today thank

00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,049
you so much

00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:02,409
I think he's going to say we asked

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:06,190
whether there are any questions um but

00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:08,230
your incomes very fast for me

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,899
sorry about that either I actually

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,519
deleted a whole bunch of slides then

00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:15,130
before the questions and before I forgot

00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:22,480
it your present thank you thank you for

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:32,110
this inform mate something talk funny

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:35,760
and you are the second so are you still

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:38,559
doing on call but of course I promise to

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,480
keep make things better I cannot make

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,909
things better if I'm not part of it

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:50,080
because I will not see the effect my

00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:51,490
actions take thank you very much for

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,789
your story could you go back to that

00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:58,510
slide with the tree and the bird and the

00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,250
branch and the soul oh you mean the

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,870
schematic of the organization yes

00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,260
exactly is that it's not very difficult

00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:13,740
to go back then I thought he's taking it

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:16,090
back so they actually have only one box

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,909
they just give it to somebody take it

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,350
back and next speaker gets it again yeah

00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,120
thank you yeah that's perfect

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:24,310
it's just a small clarification does

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,110
that say us or us

00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:35,250
[Laughter]

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:35,730
I had I have never never read it that

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,540
way

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:44,610
it is us this is the herd chart

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:50,520
kinda but I'll grant you that but you

00:33:44,610 --> 00:34:01,500
know the first word in USA is us sorry

00:33:50,520 --> 00:34:05,220
somebody else thanks for the story but I

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:10,710
think there was no ending read were you

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:14,700
able to transform your team our company

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,070
it's quite hard so this might have been

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,050
my dream or something collected over 20

00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,080
years who knows no resemblance for

00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,869
real-life entities right I would like to

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,940
think that wherever I've tried I've had

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:30,119
at least some impact in that direction

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,820
I haven't eliminated all the alerts yet

00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,800
definitely I mean the problem is if you

00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,990
get your loads because someone else did

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,980
something wrong you will never get a

00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,129
good solution

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,820
I mean well there are some solutions but

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:48,659
those are very much crimes of humanity

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:50,940
so those are kind of out there is this

00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,879
convincing thing and that's a people

00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,240
skill which I I don't have I might try

00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,570
to learn that to convince people better

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,100
but if it's somebody's else's kind of

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,710
problem that's that's coming through the

00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,170
system to me what I can still do I can

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,670
offer help maybe because I know the

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,950
monitoring solution because I promised

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,570
myself I'll learn it maybe because I've

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,190
seen similar problems somewhere else

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,960
maybe I can just do that as a

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:20,609
psychological pressure can I help you

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,680
with that so all of the cases even the

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:27,440
ones where I cannot directly try to fix

00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:30,600
the problem I would almost always try to

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,930
either help directly or convince them or

00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,760
at least make the problem apparent by

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,300
that message of the day file or any

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,300
other method

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,130
so you said that you are still doing on

00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,880
Kong to get the feedback under

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:54,220
improvements or an a general note do you

00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,290
think it's possible to keep the first

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,480
clean without having the pain the

00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:04,630
polluters as part of the pain feedback

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,930
loop because usually the people that are

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:10,810
causing the pollution are not part of

00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:14,980
the pain feedback loop that the on-call

00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:17,860
service generates it true that in many

00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,240
cases yes the people who might have the

00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,880
biggest responsibility in some of the

00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:26,500
loads they might not be the recipients

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,360
of that a sharp end yes I don't have a

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,450
good solution to that besides the usual

00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,090
like to put more people on the on call

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,100
or acacia and that they the frequently

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:40,540
mentioned the developers being on call

00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:42,760
sometimes if it developers and if the

00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,020
normal methods like maybe escalating

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,050
through the management in the worst case

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,850
if these fail I would believe that yes

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,660
putting developers on on an on call

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:56,130
would be a good idea but that's again a

00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:58,720
more of a human problem of course and

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,280
I'm still learning how to best deal with

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:11,130
that but all of these suggested or

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:15,920
mentioned approaches help a bit no one

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:21,820
okay thank you very much

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:33,630
[Applause]

00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:33,630
