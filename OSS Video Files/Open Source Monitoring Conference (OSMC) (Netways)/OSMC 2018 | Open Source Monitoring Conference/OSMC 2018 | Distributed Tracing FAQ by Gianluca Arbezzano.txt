Title: OSMC 2018 | Distributed Tracing FAQ by Gianluca Arbezzano
Publication date: 2018-11-16
Playlist: OSMC 2018 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Microservices, containers and more in general distributed systems have opened a different point of view on our system and applications. We need to understand how a single event or requests cross our app jumping over networks, containers, virtual machines and sometime clod provider. There is a specific practice called distributed tracing to increase observability of systems like that. After this talk, you will have a solid idea around what tracing means, how you can instrument your applications and you will be ready to trace your application across many languages using open source technologies like OpenTracing, OpenCensus, Zipkin, Jaeger, InfluxDB. You will ask yourself how you survived until today!
