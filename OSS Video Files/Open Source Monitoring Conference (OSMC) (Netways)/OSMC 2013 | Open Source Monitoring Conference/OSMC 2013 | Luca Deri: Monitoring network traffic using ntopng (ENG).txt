Title: OSMC 2013 | Luca Deri: Monitoring network traffic using ntopng (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2013 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	ntop is a open-source network monitoring project aimed at network traffic monitoring. With the advent of modern computing architectures and high-speed networks many components had to be redesigned to address the new challenging issues.
Monitoring 10G networks require high-speed packet capture/transmission and efficient monitoring applications. Over the past 10 years ntop has created several open-source tools, kernel modules, flow-based applications for making high-speed traffic monitoring feasible on commodity hardware.
This talk will give an overview of the various ntop monitoring components including the latest version of ntop named ntopng. It will also highlight some use cases where these tools have been used successfully.
