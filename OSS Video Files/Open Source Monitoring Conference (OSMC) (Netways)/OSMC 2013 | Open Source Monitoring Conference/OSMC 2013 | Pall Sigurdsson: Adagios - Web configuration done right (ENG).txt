Title: OSMC 2013 | Pall Sigurdsson: Adagios - Web configuration done right (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2013 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Adagios ist ein Nagios/Icinga Add-on, das die Konfiguration des vorhandenen Nagios ohne Datenbank-Backend ermöglicht. Es bietet ein Web-API, funktionsreiche Konfigurationen, ein integriertes Status Interface, das automatisch die Schnittstelle zwischen PNP und mk-Live Status bildet.

Dieser Vortrag wird die Herausforderungen aufzeigen, die die Wartung einer großen Monitoring Umgebung  beansprucht und wie Adagios und das ihm zugrundeliegende Toolkit pynag dazu beitragen können ein modernes Monitoring System zum Laufen zu bringen.

thank you for coming and usually I get a

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,120
clap can I get a clap before we start I

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,120
thank you

00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,150
yeah that's very good that's very good I

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,590
like that I love it when people clap for

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:30,619
me so we're going to talk about attack

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:34,700
eos and the title of the presentation is

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,940
web configuration done right and before

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,739
i start i usually want to know like whom

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,320
i'm talking to so i can we at least try

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,780
to make it slightly interesting for you

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,100
guys so I'd like to see by a show of

00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,269
hands how many people here would

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,820
describe themselves as programmers all

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:58,280
right quite a few and how many would say

00:00:52,820 --> 00:01:01,430
there are segments all right pretty cool

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,229
good to know how many people here would

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,250
say they are the monitoring guy they

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,710
configure nagios orginca all right you

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:16,540
came to the right presentation

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:19,310
definitely so our agenda for today and

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,860
we are going to start by talking a

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,869
little bit about me that's not going to

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,100
be interesting for for you guys but it's

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,130
my presentation so I can talk about

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,200
whatever I want after that we're going

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,030
to talk a little bit about attack us

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,430
which will be slightly more relevant for

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,020
you guys and after that we're going to

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,520
see some demos and I think everyone came

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,799
here to see demos like who likes to see

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,869
demos I I usually just love the devil's

00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,520
if we have time we will talk about some

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:51,799
other tools that are not attack yells

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:55,670
but still interesting for me so a meet

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,530
Polly I have been monitoring consultant

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,840
for six or seven years now ever since

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:08,840
2009 I've been mostly involved with

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:11,000
nagios and compatible products and I've

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,930
been mostly pastes like in and around

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,890
iceland and i would describe myself as a

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,390
great fan of monitoring quality and when

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,850
I talk about monitoring quality it's

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,120
when you define perfect monitoring

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,310
system out there somewhere and it

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,690
monitors exactly what you mount meaning

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,490
you don't have an

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,110
false positives and Anna false negatives

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,880
and of course it requires zero

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,900
maintenance that would be perfect

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,180
monitoring system for me and and I

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,190
really love to try to achieve that goal

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:48,080
whenever I can I'm a core developer in

00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:53,350
these projects over here pi knack okay

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:56,770
config pine aksar python modules for

00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,130
configuring nagios and okay convict is a

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:06,500
monitoring pack thingy I've mostly been

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:10,010
doing development since 2011 however

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,520
being a monitoring consultant going

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,870
through get blames for my customers

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,680
thank for the past four years I

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:22,700
personally have created around 100,000

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,470
service checks and I'm just the

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,270
monitoring consultants usually I don't

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,400
want to be the one that is adding hosts

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,260
and services because for me that's

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,790
really really boring and for anyone that

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,820
has done it a hundred thousand times of

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,730
course it's going to be boring but why

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,770
do I put that up there it because I I

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:49,360
think I know a little bit on how to

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:53,120
configure monitoring and my conclusion

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:57,310
has been that monitoring really sucks

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,970
has anyone seen this hashtag this was a

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:04,910
two that's good anyone else okay so for

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,459
those of you don't know this is a about

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,920
two year olds hashtag that arrived on

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,350
Twitter and it was a big trench at the

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,690
time and there was some guy on the

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,480
internet and he made a very clever

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,540
observation that I t has been changing

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:25,070
really really fast and the monitoring

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,640
tools have kind of lags behind and he's

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,720
not referring to nagios or we think

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,980
specifically but they're definitely not

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:38,300
the best of the lot and I think everyone

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,300
here knows that has that is really good

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,020
with monitoring that the tools or

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,349
sometimes holding us kinda back

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,000
and even with simple things if you're

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,830
given a hostname and service description

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,960
acts and all we have to do is add a new

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,840
contact group to it it should never be a

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,970
20 to 40 minute job to do that if you're

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,360
not familiar with the configuration it

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,800
should be a 10 second job every time so

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,490
this really got me thinking that

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,080
monitoring sucks and I wanted to do

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,830
something about it to help with it so up

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,659
came attack us there were a lot of other

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,720
web configuration systems up there

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:23,310
before I started and I thought they all

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,220
really sucked so I want to make my own

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,810
that really sucked and now I have it and

00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,120
I can only hope that is slightly better

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:37,469
than all the other ones so attack eo's

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,870
it's an errand to nagios surah sinker or

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:44,789
Shinken now we have a new one announced

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,400
half an hour ago nouman and under the

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:51,479
hood we use pineapple configuration and

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:55,349
okay config for monitoring packs and as

00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,569
of late we also have tiny cute little

00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,029
status view and we use live status for

00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:05,250
that is there anyone here that is not

00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:06,599
using life status currently yeah so when

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,569
you go to work on friday or monday

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,860
whatever you are going to do stop at

00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:17,279
installed live status in steps it's

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:24,240
great so few things we are trying to

00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:26,130
achieve with developing adagios one of

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,039
it is to be the best web configuration

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:34,219
system for nagios or singer that exists

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:38,159
out there I'm fairly confident that

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:40,319
we've already reached that point partly

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,240
because all the other ones we define as

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,330
conflict generators because they don't

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,370
actually edit any conflicts they just

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:53,880
overwrite them and if anyone disagrees

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,889
with this fact I am happy to hear the

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,039
feedback in form of pull requests on get

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,039
up

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:05,699
we also try to make monitoring nice I

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,039
think the fact of the matter that

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:15,120
neither Mac user is Inga are really nice

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:17,849
but we try to do our best to take like

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,610
my nuances as a consultant everything

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:23,639
that takes too much time for me we try

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,169
to implement that into attack us so

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,719
usually if we bring a new feature in to

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,400
attack us it has to satisfy at least one

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,199
of those two goals either to make it the

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,860
best monitoring system or best

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,300
configuration system out there sorry or

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,659
to make our existing monitoring more

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,819
nice if it doesn't fulfill those goals

00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:47,189
we will probably not implement those

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:49,710
features there are few things i think we

00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:51,029
do right and they're also a ton of

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,199
things i think we do wrong but i'm not

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,310
going to tell you about any of those so

00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,800
i'm going to talk about the ones that we

00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:03,360
do well and first one is really easy to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,009
install and it will install on top of

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,289
your existing modules or a single

00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,270
instance we don't want to take over your

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,860
monitoring system like some other

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,240
configuration systems do because that

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,860
wouldn't be nice to do that so little

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,599
yum install and we were ready to go and

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,979
we can start them to some configurations

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,120
if you don't like it we can just remove

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,250
it and we were not any worse for it we

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,360
also have some really sharp command line

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:34,110
tools namely my neck and okay compact

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,539
tools and the reason we do that is that

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:42,329
one we really love command line tools

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:46,620
and also that most of our users they are

00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:49,110
never pure receivers of software usually

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,699
our users they take softer and they like

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,100
to glue it together and build their own

00:08:50,699 --> 00:09:00,570
stuff so we want to make that really

00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:05,220
really easy to build your own stuff we

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,319
do not have a database back-end so I

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,760
don't know if you have used other web

00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,860
configuration systems out there that

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,100
have

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,230
database mysql or something and then you

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,760
want to write some script to make

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,320
changes to a configuration system or

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,480
something and then afterwards you go to

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,760
web configuration and you click that big

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,980
export button that will delete all your

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,730
config files and overwrite them with

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,700
whatever they thought was right we don't

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,269
have that instead we use the macula

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,910
sourcing configuration files as backend

00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:40,610
and if we want to make a tiny little

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,860
change like a contact group to a service

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,829
or something that will be the only bytes

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,670
that will be written to the config maps

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:53,329
and I'm very happy is there anyone else

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:58,040
that is happy about this ok people love

00:09:53,329 --> 00:10:01,640
it's good so I'm not the only one and we

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,120
have a fully functional rest api that is

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,410
both for status data and also for

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,990
configuration it means that are lots of

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:16,550
cool ideas can be really simple all of a

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,160
sudden for example there was one what

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,010
was it yeah if you do a reboot on your

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,050
servers have a tiny little hook that

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,240
will connect to an ocular system say i

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,920
want downtime for 20 minutes because

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,199
someone typed in reboot and press enter

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,779
now that can be really see now that's

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:37,399
just one w gets away that's kind of cool

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:39,410
and also to put in your kick starts when

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,180
you're installing a new server have it

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,890
connect to the monitoring system and say

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,220
hey I'm a new server this is my hostname

00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:48,920
and IP address just give me the standard

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,279
Linux checks that you have previously

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:56,180
defined I want that and also log back in

00:10:52,279 --> 00:11:00,560
here and deploy an agent's stuff like

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:05,839
work really easy process at least third

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:09,529
thing I think we do really well we or at

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,519
least I I really really believe in a

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:15,920
gift culture and what does that mean we

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,579
have we have a huge community out there

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,279
others doing monitoring and I really

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,840
think that we are contributing to it by

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,460
giving a lot of

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:32,030
good software into it and there is no

00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,030
secret sauce or subscription version or

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:38,090
something like that just like the NS

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,560
clients guys that you can try to give us

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,790
more money we won't give you better

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,440
software for it and however we do

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,210
believe that the effort we're putting

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,510
into it that we are going to get it back

00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:53,450
somehow meaning that if you use our

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,130
software you really like it we know you

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,230
will send us an email and tell us that

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,250
you like it if you have patches you will

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,110
send us the patches and if you think we

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,320
saved you a few hundred man-hours

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,780
because we had pie knock why not send us

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,580
the money or ask for professional

00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,380
services and is that we are going to

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,380
take really really good care of you guys

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:26,780
anyway demo time I do have this site up

00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,840
called them out at da gusto dork but i

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:37,430
think i'm going to cheat a little bit

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:39,230
and not use that one mainly because

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,670
someone scared me recently that they

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,200
would log into the demo system while i

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,880
was demoing it and if i would be adding

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,920
host they would go and delete them the

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:51,800
same second and also the last time i

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,780
checked in there was a lot of people

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,850
adding hosts and they were trying to do

00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,810
all sorts of sequel injections and

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,700
javascript injections and that was

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,950
impressive for me to see how like a i

00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,060
don't think there was a break-in well I

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,070
was fairly confident there was no

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,440
breaking but it made for some really

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:13,520
really ugly host names so I'm not going

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:17,930
to trouble you guys with that so here we

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,550
have the system we lock in and you can

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,360
see there is a big black toolbar up here

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:27,850
and it shows you several different

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,850
components one of them here is

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,630
one of them here shows shows you the

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:43,940
regular nagios interface I use Rock

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:47,170
person is the truck I hear they're

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,040
awesome stuff thank you for making it

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,560
but that's not what I'm going to talk

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,530
about right now it's we have our own

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,100
status interface at up here and when we

00:13:54,530 --> 00:14:03,380
first click on it we go to an overview

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,750
page maybe kind of like in the old CGI's

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,510
in the sink in nagios soon as inca the

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,990
tactical overview thing but this one we

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:14,720
think is sexually useful so we have here

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:18,400
some total so you can see I have almost

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,410
2000 services here running on my laptop

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,690
we have top alert producers here which

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,520
is i think is convenient to have in

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,140
front of your eyes regularly because

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:34,880
often that's indicator of bad thresholds

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,010
or broken plugins and right over here we

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,330
have a list of unhandled service

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,330
problems and in fact if i click up here

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:48,110
where it says problems right you see i

00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:50,780
have a bunch of services here that are

00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,610
in a warning or critical stage kind of

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,970
like the unhandled services list in the

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,580
old nagios interface you can see most of

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,770
these are pink chucks which makes sense

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:05,360
because i'm going to really crappy Wi-Fi

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:09,440
here so that's good i think it's maybe a

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,360
little slow so i'm gonna just fly by a

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,740
few features some of them are going to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,550
be hit to miss some of them you think

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,140
you're cool and some are not so we can

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,090
select many of them at a time and to

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,160
recheck we will and the page will wait

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,010
in the background until nike else has

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,180
finished executing the check when it's

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:35,540
done with all the things it's going to

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:36,860
refresh the page and we can also click

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:43,820
on a couple of them and I can also

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,769
problem yeah I will deal with it or even

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,649
better

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:50,689
I have a feature here that I never

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,399
expected that people will use so much

00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,319
but turns out that almost everyone is

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,449
using there's a tiny little button here

00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:01,610
that does nothing but send out an email

00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:05,660
so I have two services checked and what

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:11,319
i can do is i can send a mail to call it

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:16,399
colleague here Tommy say hi i am at

00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:20,180
conference this one is i knew then i

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,000
don't have to do anything and what it

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,370
will do it will send him an email with

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,160
list of the services if the email client

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,720
supports HTML we have really nifty like

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,550
acknowledgement and recheck buttons in

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,629
the email and optionally if we click

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,250
acknowledge here the services are going

00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,980
to be acknowledged with sent an email to

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,579
this guy meaning that he is hopefully

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,600
going to take care of it way easier than

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,819
saying you're going to take care of

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,970
something sell yourself signing it over

00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:56,649
to someone else alright so what looks

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,500
good here we have google com ping sure

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,579
so if you click on an individual check

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,069
will go into something that looks

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,909
similar to status detail if you're

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:09,770
familiar with that one so we have a few

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,110
tabs here that will organize your data

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,329
and the general one we will just have

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,209
the most basic stuff like what's the

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:20,360
status IP address of the host output

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,400
from the plugin and one thing that I'm

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,650
really happy about we take the poor

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,439
performance data if there is any and we

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,030
break it down into a nice table and you

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,270
can see here there are two performance

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:35,150
metrics there's a packet loss and round

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,890
trip average and it will look at the

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,640
thresholds and will tell us that here is

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:43,520
the problem and maybe not all that

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,400
useful on this check but think about

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,380
disk checks were you checking 100 discs

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,409
and the pluggable just report warning

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,539
some discs it has a problem then it's

00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:55,840
really easy to say which disc has a

00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,840
problem

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:06,930
we also have some graphs we integrate

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:10,150
with P and P for nagios mostly so what

00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,550
attackers will do it will detective PMP

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,720
is installed if it is installed it's

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,940
going to check if this hostess and

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,690
graphs and it's going to display the

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,840
graphs that we have I know it's very

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,680
common to take the what's the name

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,930
attribute extra URL make the extra UL be

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,280
a link into PMP for nagios and if you

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,860
want to see some graphs you click it and

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,540
you go into P and P and no okay we don't

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,370
have any of that just if there are

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,460
graphs will print them and you can use

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:41,590
the extra URL for action URL I think it

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:49,720
is you can use it for something a little

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:53,560
more useful so if a history tab here

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,050
would show not only how it will show how

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,870
the state changes have been for the

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,430
service and you can see that I've been

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,760
on this hotel for quite a while and it's

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:06,760
always been bad so maybe it's time to

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,940
edit some thresholds for it so you do

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,220
have an edit button here and when we

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,220
click that button you can see we go into

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,200
a slightly different interface because

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,610
now we assume we're an admin into the

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
system we were here and we're here to

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,990
make changes we're not just accepting

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,310
the data and using it we cannot change

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,680
some stuff and similar to the other one

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:33,880
that like all the attributes are broken

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,870
into several fields and if we want to do

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:41,890
a change like add it to a service group

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:50,670
took me be added to this one here as

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:52,720
well click Save boom it's in there and

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,080
we see we have a little button here

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,330
called geek edit and if we click it we

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,980
will see the actual definition that is

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,840
in the file and this is byte by byte the

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,360
definition as it looks in your file so

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,680
if you would rather do it here because

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,510
there's an attribute that we don't

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,150
support or whatever is

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:21,010
you can still go here and do whatever

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:22,630
changes you want I think this is one of

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,340
the first features that we implemented

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,470
we didn't have any other theater stuff

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,720
we just had the geek at it and then we

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,100
like every time we had to use qik at it

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,510
we see all that would be nifty if there

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,880
was a faster way to do it like this in

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:38,580
this so that's how we actually started

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,890
by developing it and it turned out that

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,410
like going in here instead of editing a

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,020
config file on text editor doesn't seem

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,580
like you're gaining a lot but you are in

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,160
fact gaining a lot because you save all

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,400
the time that you spent finding that

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,610
configuration file so that's one I'm

00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,550
really happy about and over here to the

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,230
right we can see like related

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,960
configuration items so we have here a

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,390
quick link to the template that we're

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,200
using we can see the check command here

00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,870
it's called ok c dash check on the score

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,910
pink which means it comes from one of

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:20,550
our monitoring packs so it's slightly

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,550
different from the regular Jack ping and

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,510
if we click on it we see this is the

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,270
configuration for the Jacka mad which is

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:34,390
not all that useful but we also have

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:38,650
here a tab called monitoring and what we

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:41,110
get here is we can select which check

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,490
amount is being used and you will see

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,830
here below it will read from the command

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,590
line definition all the custom variables

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,960
it has which makes it really convenient

00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,320
if you want to add or edit some

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,530
thresholds for it and you can see here

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,960
under the command line you have like

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,030
macros like house address yes they were

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,100
here and docus will take care of the

00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,670
really boring stuff which is to resolve

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,070
those macros for you I don't know if you

00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:15,490
guys like how many here have used custom

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:18,730
variables for services they are quite

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,440
nifty but if you are creating check

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,050
comments a lot like I have been doing or

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,350
creating your own plugins you know

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,169
getting this string here right

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,020
can be really really boring and

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:33,010
cumbersome and it was like ah yeah i

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:36,440
forgot the single quote here all right

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:40,100
change it save the file reload nagios

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,669
click recheck wait refresh a couple of

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,130
times no it was still wrong so now it's

00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:50,210
really simple and you see here below we

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:54,410
have resolved command line and if we

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:56,480
want to change something like we have

00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:00,409
here the warning thresholds you will see

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,830
it's supposed to be here if we want to

00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:06,320
change it to 200 that's just fine and we

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:11,090
can take this new command and we can

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,530
paste it into a shell if we want because

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,840
that would be quicker than reloading

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,390
nagios and then finding out it's not

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,179
right or we also have a little button

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:22,220
here called to run check buggin which

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,020
means attack us will resolve that check

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,150
amount it's going to run it and it's

00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,039
going to share with the output which is

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:35,720
really nice if you were working with the

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:39,909
check Lancelot all right lots of other

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:45,340
stuff here that it's for me really

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:49,360
boring actually a few niceties like

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,360
resolving contacts and stuff like that

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:54,320
yeah I think that's all I have to say

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,640
about that let's go into okay configure

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,809
so this is us editing a single instance

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,330
that's already here and if we were

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,740
making a small change just changing a

00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,400
service description or something or

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,370
saving it it can be really easy you see

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,350
up here it has icon that is telling us

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,320
that some modifications have been made

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,830
and it's time to reload the monitoring

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,320
core so we can fit around to some

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,909
changes and if we're happy we click

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,970
reload then we will see the changes up

00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:30,559
here in our one drink or but if we want

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:33,200
to add new hosts we have here unit

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,059
called okay complex all these or is our

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,090
template engine and or monitoring packs

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:41,330
and maybe it's good if I start by X

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:44,260
planning why we went into making this is

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,270
that we work for a lot of companies and

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,400
almost every single one of them was

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,409
making their own custom shell scripts

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,220
for adding new host because it sets a

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:56,390
mundane task and if you're even at least

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,020
bit clever you will find a way to

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,150
automate it and do that easier so we

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,549
thought okay so if everyone is doing it

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:08,179
like maybe we could do it in an abstract

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:10,070
manner so you not everyone has to

00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:15,799
implement for themselves and we can also

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:20,210
make some suggestions so if I had a

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:23,179
house say example punto com if I had Oh

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,809
yep it will resolve here for us means we

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,549
have at least a little bit of internet

00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,679
we can choose which group to put in I'll

00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,330
just stick with the defaults and then it

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,169
asked what kind of templates to add on

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,200
it and these would be our monitoring

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:43,220
packs which are highly opinionated and

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,370
that's like our idea so we have here

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,830
standard Linux checks that's our idea of

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,059
what a standard Linux server how it

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,220
should be monitored before you know

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:53,899
anything about what is running most of

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,740
our customers make changes to these and

00:25:53,899 --> 00:26:00,110
like they have their own ideas and we

00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,200
don't have an agent on example com

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:09,230
although I would much like to we do have

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:18,799
flag standard HTTP checks standard HTTPS

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:22,850
checks adding okay says save successful

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,029
and now we have a few options one of

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:28,220
them is to go and install an agent on it

00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:32,659
if we click on that we see here you can

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:35,330
type in the name of a host and you can

00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:38,659
choose either one of two methods that we

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:41,840
have ssh and windex yeah and that means

00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:45,590
it will deploy our agent that has a

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,750
pretty sensible config so we decided

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,299
that if it's a windows machine we're

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:54,659
going to install Anna's client and like

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:56,879
our set of convicts on it and for the

00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:00,899
Linux ones we also support like Debian

00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:06,809
RedHat even susie i think someone sent

00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:09,419
patches for suse recently and not much

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,730
to say about that username password if

00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,710
you're monitoring server has ssh key

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,059
source logged in using Kerberos you will

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:18,809
use that we don't have to type in a

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:20,759
password click Submit and boom is going

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,499
to install an agent for us something

00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:25,830
that I'm really happy about but I can't

00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:28,679
demo that for you unfortunately i'll

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:31,980
just try to convey the idea that it's

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,570
really cool when I do is there anyone

00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,940
here that thinks this is cool or things

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:42,179
that installing agents manually is

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:49,049
pouring I think so we also have a

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:52,139
network scan feature and let's see I

00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:54,179
think we can run this one just loop back

00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:57,200
I'm not going to dare scaring something

00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:59,879
on the internet if I don't have Wi-Fi in

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,149
fact last time I try to demo this with

00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:04,769
no no internet connectivity it crashed

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:07,350
on me because my machine had no

00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:10,320
interfaces for some reason turns out

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:12,929
right deleted the loopback somehow gives

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,190
you a little trouble so anyway so we

00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:22,619
scan and it shows you here we have three

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:24,929
machines localhost is already here so we

00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:26,279
do not have an app button for it but for

00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,919
the other ones we have a convenient

00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,679
button to add into monitoring and it

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,269
will do some basic detection it will it

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,359
will tell us like what kind of operating

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:39,269
system it is does it have nrpe installed

00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:42,029
or not is it configured to talk to us

00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:44,509
are we in the loud hosts etc is it a web

00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:48,359
server and well what we use this for is

00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:52,049
not so much for automation but it's more

00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:54,179
like a checklists if you focus a lot of

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,409
monitoring for a month and then you

00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,970
can't focus on that anymore because

00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:59,309
you're busy got all those new servers

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,649
and when you're done with that usually

00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:04,529
go hard did I monitor all of them so

00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:05,480
there's like a quick way just to scan

00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,160
the network

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,670
check if they're all being monitored not

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:15,290
I think that's really convenient and

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:19,680
just in case that you forgot something

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:35,340
yeah see i just added a host maybe i can

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:40,350
just do a reload ok go and status now I

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:42,660
kind of wonder if I'm going to recheck

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,360
here just in case we see our new hostess

00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,790
here and these are the checks that we

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,650
added and if we just take a quick look

00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:54,330
at the HTTP one again we see the

00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:01,640
performance data broken down into time

00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:01,640
in size really handy go back into edit

00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:07,860
so it got our our monitoring pack for

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,200
check HTTP which is just the good old

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,020
check HTTP that comes with a standard

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,130
plugins but you see we are using the

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:20,430
macros really cleverly here like the on

00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:24,050
redirect who remembers which option that

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:29,190
is that mean minus R for redirect nodes

00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:31,710
minus F I think or something and quite

00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:33,870
handy i like this and i'm quite happy

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,000
and I think one step closer to making

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,460
monitoring nice because all that

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,420
Montaigne stuff like regular HTTP checks

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,100
all of a sudden they are easy and I feel

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:54,560
better and I'm slightly more happy as

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:58,290
our results we have google maps

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,700
integration and nothing really fancy

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,430
about that almost all of my customers

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,260
have implemented that on their own they

00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:06,270
think it's a nice idea that's this is

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,960
all going to learn javascript going to

00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:12,150
connect google maps with nagios so to

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,820
all of those i say sorry that I did that

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:17,049
and now your script is useless because

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:23,320
mine looks slightly better

00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:25,090
I see we have here yeah we have a

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:30,700
business intelligence module that we

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:36,850
have been working on is it going to load

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:38,739
for us yes so at first we really didn't

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,210
see the point like this is like for two

00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:42,129
or three years with your monitoring when

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,399
we couldn't really see the point of

00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:48,820
doing business intelligence modules

00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,549
because we thought whatever your

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,960
business intelligence module is going to

00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:58,090
be you can always write a plugin for

00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,580
that that was our old approach and so if

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,289
you want to know with two of these syrup

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,289
yeah you just write a plugin that checks

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,840
the two of these but now we've been

00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,999
doing a lot of it so when we go okay

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,940
maybe it's not so useless and you can

00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:16,419
save a lot of time just by like in this

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,909
case we have a business process X and it

00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:25,590
relies on like databases storage etc etc

00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:28,869
and if we click on it we should have a

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,700
really nice dashboard that comes up is

00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:33,970
there anyone knows where this layer

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,879
comes from I want to see in it you know

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:40,629
it okay so i made this great layout for

00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:43,899
a dashboard and completely original or

00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:46,210
something like that but we have a lot of

00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,100
customers that now have a demand for a

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,509
nice dashboard like this and it's

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,070
usually meant like not for the

00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,350
technicians because they usually look at

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:57,759
just the unhandled problems but they

00:32:53,350 --> 00:33:00,489
look at for management is one and also

00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,710
for knock someone that takes the phone

00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:04,299
call and like it's a male up or down you

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,649
don't really want to look at all the

00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:08,499
unhandled problems if you don't know

00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:10,299
what this critical means because it's

00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:12,970
ninety-five percent full all you want to

00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:15,879
see is or my web services up or down yes

00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,100
or no like quite simple so there's no

00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:22,059
more detail than this and you just have

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:25,570
the basic metrics to look at here this

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:27,190
can be quite handy and i'm going to show

00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,570
you one instance of this where we're

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:37,259
running in reality it's a page call

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:39,240
old Iceland adagios ork I don't know if

00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:44,340
anyone here has heard of this this is a

00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,779
project called monitor Iceland and while

00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,220
we have been trying to accomplish in

00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:52,740
this is to take everything that we feel

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:58,130
is important to Icelandic society and

00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:04,470
we're going to monitor it with nagios so

00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:07,470
green yellow red for Iceland and we well

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:09,540
I kind of love it and you can see here

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,460
if we go through the description this is

00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,579
a real time under of different metrics

00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,530
we try to include everything we can get

00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,960
our hands on like radiation levels or

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:22,560
how many people are in the emergency

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:29,460
room in Iceland or the public transport

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:32,339
is it up or is it not we do have volcano

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,250
status that is a good story actually

00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:39,240
because we first started with the

00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:42,960
project and then we had a phone call

00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:46,319
from this really nice guy and he worked

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,819
for a weather office and he calls up and

00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:50,659
said oh this project is really cool is

00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:54,839
there anything I can help you with and

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:57,480
we said like yeah is there any reliable

00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,730
data source that is up to date the king

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,280
check just to see if there's a volcano

00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,410
erupting or not because the business

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,089
process will have before it was kind of

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,940
unreliable it was like looking for

00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:11,400
alerts from the weather network combined

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,000
with number of people in Icelandic

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,250
talking about volcanoes it was like we

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,790
didn't think it was like reliable enough

00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:22,920
and he goes to see well yeah I know we

00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,960
have it but what to toss the internet

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,750
have this and then he sent me an email

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,760
and said yep I found this one secret URL

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:33,119
for you that you can use here's the link

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,500
and there's a data source for you that

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,849
you can use their I don't know if you

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,970
can use it though or not because it was

00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:40,680
a PNG image with was like a map of

00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,599
Iceland and there was a marker where

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,250
every known volcanoes and it had like

00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,610
was I the green

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:50,130
or rat so I had to make an oculus plugin

00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,710
that downloads the PNG image and counts

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,770
the number of red pixels to detect how

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,590
many volcanoes are currently erupting

00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:00,540
and I thought like okay PNG image that's

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,820
a terrible data source it it could have

00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,850
been worse it could have been soap like

00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:10,950
so thank God it was at least PNG but you

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,650
can see here and this is an actual life

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,080
business process the name of the process

00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,720
is Iceland and the current health status

00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,440
of it is normal even though some of the

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,340
subprocesses have minor problems then we

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,940
choose like metrics to put in that can't

00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,080
be interesting I scraps so here we have

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:35,940
patients in the emergency room they're

00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:37,230
currently 16 over there we have some

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,240
other ones that are hidden like how many

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:43,650
people are currently undergoing surgery

00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,630
and my little niece she had an appendix

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,640
problem like two or three months ago

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:49,950
back and she had to go into surgery

00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,450
right away and this was during the

00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,040
middle of the night so I was looking at

00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,310
the graph and like zero people and then

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,380
she wanted to look one person half an

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:06,330
hour later she was done now like hey

00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:07,830
you're done it yes yes can I get another

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,750
applause for that too it's like yeah

00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:14,970
thank you thank you yeah and one thing

00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,310
that I will show you later on if I have

00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,050
time but one thing we've been doing in

00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,960
tokyo's because we're really good at

00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,760
parsing performance data so we work a

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,290
lot with the performance data that

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,480
nagios has or is he gasps and if we use

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:33,240
it for all sorts of different things

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,810
like this would be one typical like

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,460
average response time of all the web

00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,020
servers in this host group that I have

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,740
called I static web servers it's like

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:47,640
top 300 biggest web sites in Iceland or

00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:50,010
something and can't be interesting and I

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,010
I keep finding more and more useful ways

00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:56,130
for writing checks that do nothing else

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,750
than aggregating other status checks or

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:03,420
using the performance

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:05,250
data for other status checks and it's a

00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,460
shame to say that out of those three

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,400
hundred i think somewhere around 15 of

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,080
them take more than five seconds to load

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,330
so at some point i think i will put up a

00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,770
name and shame list of like the slowest

00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:22,310
websites that are used we have the

00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:24,570
ability to browse down a little bit so

00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,670
environment and natural disasters we can

00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:30,590
click on that and it will show us

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:33,360
another one and you can see here that

00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:37,530
there is currently an avalanche alert in

00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:40,640
iceland and there's also a warning on

00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:45,420
earthquake levels and this would be

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:49,670
typical use of how we use the business

00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:53,970
processes so it shows us here graph and

00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:56,010
there are 10 earthquakes in Iceland for

00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,170
the past one hour but they've all been

00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:01,410
really minor once so that's not really

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,930
important to us but if there is one

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,480
really big one we want to escalate the

00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:09,420
status to critical there's only one

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,520
problem with that is that earthquake

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,990
centers or delicate thing and if someone

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,180
just happens to be walking too close to

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,030
one it does like this it's going to say

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,390
oh ok its catastrophic earthquake coming

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:24,960
along so we can also add a little bit of

00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:27,210
mitigation factors again twitter is good

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,370
for that so if we have a big one and a

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,320
ton of people saying I static the time

00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:34,880
will feel the earthquake yeah we will

00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:38,670
escalate that two major earthquake so

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:48,110
can be useful under the right

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:52,020
circumstances anyway I have here that I

00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:54,450
can show you guys so there I'll give you

00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,190
guys a little bit piqued this is

00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:00,360
something I was coding on the airplane

00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:02,010
on the way over here so if it explodes

00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,210
please just close your eyes while I

00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:09,030
change to another another page here

00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:11,410
we're loading up the performance metrics

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,890
that are currently inside the running

00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:19,240
skills instance so we see here some

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:25,690
house ping jack and statuses and I have

00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:27,460
no one here and I I don't know exactly

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,240
where we were going with this feature

00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:33,510
but I keep finding more and more uses

00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:38,530
for it so if you look for example at

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:40,569
ping on all hosts and from the command

00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:44,200
line you can kind of like query it like

00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:45,430
a database and you look here at the

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,160
performance data and all of a sudden

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:57,010
we're seeing packet loss for all of our

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:59,309
hosts and we see here some of them have

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:05,470
a lot of packet loss others do not and

00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:07,660
probably cpu utilization here even

00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,670
better one where you can look at the

00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,880
utilization for all your host or a

00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,799
subset of hosts think if you have a CPU

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,390
intensive cluster it might be

00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:22,779
interesting to see all your data in a

00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:25,599
table like this the idea came from one

00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:27,910
of our checks that we deploy with both

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,829
Windows and Linux agents we check for

00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:33,460
the number of outstanding security

00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:36,430
updates running and was a really good

00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,720
idea at first at least like who doesn't

00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:40,660
want to get allergic if you forgot to

00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,700
patch the server but then later on we

00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,650
started getting like complaints because

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,569
it was creating a lot of noise and they

00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,220
were going okay Polly I know this

00:41:46,569 --> 00:41:51,369
plug-in you wrote that was really cool

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,740
but it's not a critical problem if

00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:56,319
there's one outstanding updates so can

00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,970
we have the check still running because

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,069
it's nice to have the performance data

00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:04,569
and however we don't want to alert on it

00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:10,599
we just want to show green all the time

00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:12,700
so we can just look at it and wasn't

00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,069
really useful but all of a sudden now it

00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,589
is useful because imagine a table like

00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:20,380
this and you can look at all your host

00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:22,839
see outstanding updates and all of a

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,460
sudden we are kind of out of the

00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,119
monitoring scope we're getting more into

00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,009
the

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,660
spin scope and I know there are a lot of

00:42:27,009 --> 00:42:30,460
tools out there that would do this

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,049
hundred times better but you don't

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,539
always have those insults in your

00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:36,789
infrastructure so if you're collecting

00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:45,180
all this data anyway why not make

00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:49,509
something useful out of it all right I

00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,980
don't know how what's other interesting

00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:53,349
things to show one thing I learned

00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:58,829
recently so i'm looking at host groups

00:42:53,349 --> 00:43:01,839
here that are on my laptop and in

00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:04,960
configuration files you can put host

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,970
groups into host groups which can be

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,049
kind of cool because you can organize

00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:12,430
your stuff together but the cjis they

00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:16,440
don't really know anything about this

00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:21,329
and they don't convey this to you so

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:25,180
let's see if this will of course it has

00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:28,809
okay so all of a sudden this can be

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,279
quite useful and to display its you have

00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,960
all your customers and then there's a

00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:34,269
list of customers in just summary for

00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,619
those customers we usually have this up

00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:43,059
on our we have few like big flat-screen

00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:44,799
TVs at our office some of them are like

00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:47,410
monitoring our internal systems and some

00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:49,059
of them are monitoring our customers and

00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,420
we aggregate a lot of status info from

00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:54,279
our customers so we sometimes rotate

00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,980
between like this super high level view

00:43:54,279 --> 00:43:59,049
and then we have like a dashboard here

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,720
this is designed for the flat screen TV

00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:04,470
it will just show you like unhandled

00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,519
problems and if there are no problems

00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,829
itla would switch over to playing

00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:11,289
football or something because nobody

00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:13,930
likes an empty screen but then again

00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:15,849
when you have a problem then it should

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,430
show you those problems rotating screens

00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:21,369
are a good idea by the way because I

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:25,630
will get less tired from looking at them

00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:28,690
I do work for one enterprise where they

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:32,440
have an outstanding rule that if their

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:34,420
screen is completely empty and there are

00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,089
no unhandled problems there's a picture

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,410
of an ice cream and the boss goes out to

00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:38,770
the store and buys ice cream for

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,660
everyone

00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,390
it's a big deal because they're like

00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,060
100-something people working in that

00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:48,010
department interesting things and again

00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,560
they do contribute to making monitoring

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,810
nice and the monitoring system is

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,300
working for us we are not slaves to the

00:44:52,810 --> 00:45:06,640
monitoring system on those terms I think

00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:12,610
I more or less done the tools mm-hmm yep

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:15,760
I already told you about all this let's

00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:21,130
just cut a short thank you guys very

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:23,680
much for listening for kisan keep get up

00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,150
if you know how to fork especially if we

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,020
can send us patches because we love

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:31,120
patches and if you don't focus anyway

00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,510
because it makes us feel good to see lot

00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:39,030
of works and lots of likes we like likes

00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:39,030
and so I'm all done thank you very much

00:45:43,850 --> 00:46:03,330
so thank you any questions so the

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:06,590
question is most will have a huge

00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:09,930
configuration already how do you migrate

00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,900
its imp it's very simple you just

00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,400
install a Tiger's Claw say will work on

00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,830
your existing configuration we're not

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,230
going to migrate anything because that's

00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:29,550
not nice so we wanted to work out of the

00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:31,500
box on your convict it will not it will

00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,830
not force a for certain file structure

00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,900
however if you are adding new hosts by

00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,750
default it will suggest the same file

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,180
structure that we really like and so

00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,990
usually it creates stuff more structured

00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:47,490
way than I can at least so in those

00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,800
terms you have one you would have to set

00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:52,380
your own defaults if you want but it

00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,640
doesn't care where your or host or

00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,990
services live because it's going to

00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,660
start by reading your main configuration

00:46:54,990 --> 00:47:06,869
file and just read all the objects there

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:08,550
and it will edit them in place yes the

00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:17,690
question is is possible to do massive

00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:17,690
updates yes yes it is so yeah

00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:40,769
so the question is sorry I didn't get

00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:54,779
that what was the question so you have a

00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:57,180
host group mm-hmm all right yes it that

00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:59,369
will work one hundred percent because we

00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:02,969
don't deal with it there's 10 Dodgers

00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:03,839
insult / na kyo server that's how we do

00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:08,869
with it when it comes to the

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:12,390
configuration well we kind of have plans

00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:14,279
to support multiple instances but we

00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,049
don't have anyone paying us enough money

00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:19,499
to do it and it's not really scratching

00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:21,539
in it for me right now so we've kind of

00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:24,690
thought about it but we kind of don't go

00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:26,579
there when it comes to the bulk updates

00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,380
you can do it from attack us you can

00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,940
select multiple services and you can

00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,269
click Edit and you can change like a

00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,190
single attribute for it I usually do it

00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:36,779
from the command line though because for

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,079
me that kind of feels quicker and the

00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:43,709
web interface wasn't really helping so

00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:46,140
we sometimes have a really good bulk

00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:48,390
commit that looks like this pine a cup

00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,549
dates changed an attribute like in this

00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:52,559
case change the check amount and then

00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:56,219
you type in where that's kind of like an

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,449
SQL car kind of like SQL we don't want

00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:01,259
to go there because we don't support

00:48:57,449 --> 00:49:10,949
everything that SQL supports any other

00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:14,869
questions yes if we can manage the

00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:19,170
nagios config files from check MK yes

00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:22,229
but but the check MK files like the

00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:25,890
check MK configuration files we do not

00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:30,269
and we wanted to do it because we really

00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:32,460
liked check MK but the configuration

00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:35,160
format is not really

00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,320
friendly for that and we would we wish

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,220
the nice people at MK would change the

00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,690
format to be slightly friendlier to this

00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:45,720
they have an idea for themselves with a

00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,859
rule-based stuff which definitely does

00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,540
not go into the group of making

00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:53,190
monitoring nice although it's extremely

00:49:48,540 --> 00:50:03,210
efficient at some points so currently no

00:49:53,190 --> 00:50:05,490
we do not yes can we configure Alta yes

00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:11,520
we are also a fully functional l-dub

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:13,980
configuration system yeah we can that is

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,020
we could implement it in the way that

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,089
all the configuration we do it's not

00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,740
implemented in the web interface it's in

00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:22,140
the underlying library called PI knack

00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:25,430
and if you would look at the code you

00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:28,380
see we have multiple back and modules

00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:30,180
the one we use mostly is the conflict

00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,910
module which is represent the narcos

00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,740
config files and we are working on

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,570
another one that is synced to config

00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,540
files which also suffers from the same

00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,960
problem it's not something you would

00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:45,240
configure in 2013 that format but that's

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:52,170
another topic but but we could make an

00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:55,710
ldap bacchante if we so desired the one

00:50:52,170 --> 00:51:00,530
asked what we do badly good I would

00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,530
rather not say what we do badly yes

00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:24,350
so you have a custom cmdb and you have

00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:27,840
custom scripts that generate the icinga

00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:29,430
configuration and you're not happy with

00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,020
writing custom scripts you wouldn't look

00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,970
for more standard way to generate the

00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:46,200
configuration and yes we can provide

00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:48,090
that we have that in the rest api and we

00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,580
use it for a lot of things mostly for

00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:54,540
making the web interface faster like in

00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:56,100
our own product and also i told you

00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:59,070
about the ok conflict monitoring packs

00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,600
which has like create new house apply

00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:04,020
all of these service templates in like

00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:06,690
one function that's why we use for the

00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:11,460
most and if I were in your shoes that's

00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:26,400
what I would use the same time and more

00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:28,050
questions no one more yes integrated in

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,330
the way that you in siloam d and you so

00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:34,200
empty to install adagios it's a

00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:37,550
wonderful idea is there anyone here that

00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:43,890
is familiar with the omt or maintains it

00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:46,590
ok it's already gone well yeah I might

00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,450
have if I weren't so lazy i really hate

00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,660
packaging stuff because it's a lot of

00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:58,420
work but definitely it could be done it

00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:59,950
should be done I think all right

00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:04,660
is there anyone that wants to buy me

00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:06,460
beer at six o'clock no because there was

00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:08,140
a presentation like half an hour ago and

00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,920
someone brought a bottle of Jagermeister

00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:19,380
on on demand so who's with the shell

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:19,380
triangles one more question yes free oh

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:27,940
it's yes it is a difficult does anyone

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,069
like the idea of gift cultured yes I do

00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,490
quite like it and I really want to

00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:35,200
believe in that it works and otherwise

00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,730
I've been sweating my ass off for four

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,650
years making something getting nothing

00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:44,410
out of it I really want to get something

00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:49,660
out of it who doesn't alright question

00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:53,790
come on No alright so thank you very

00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:53,790
