Title: OSMC 2013 | Fernando HÃ¶nig: Distributed Monitoring and Cloud Scaling for Web Apps (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2013 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The first part will cover how we have integrated Nagios and WebInject in a distributed monitoring infrastructure in AWS EC2 using event handlers for making extra checks from different locations setting a threshold for each location and fire an status for each situation. We also call different APIs from other monitoring tools like Gomez Networks and Pingdom and use that as feeds. For notifications we integrated CallWithUS (For VoIP calls) and Clickatell for SMS alerts.
The second part of the presentation will show in deep how to enable/disable hosts, services from devices that are created automatically with Amazon EC2 auto-scaling in a cloud infrastructure.
Also will show how important are the hostgroups and the implementation of those in a diverse kind of customers. After that will be how we integrate Nagvis to Nagios using mklive_status broker in order to make awesome maps and even more maps automatically. This part also will show how easy is to join different nagios systems in only one map and have the whole picture of our systems in one shoot.
