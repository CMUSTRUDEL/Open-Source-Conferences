Description: 
	The Assimilation Project provides integrated IT discovery and monitoring.  Discovery is continuous and has zero-network-footprint.

Monitoring is extremely scalable due to a radically distributed architecture.  Discovery informs monitoring - simplifying configuration and maintenance.  Discovery finds systems you've forgotten about, and services you aren't monitoring and dependencies.  About 30% of all outside security breaches come through forgotten systems *- *critical for security.
