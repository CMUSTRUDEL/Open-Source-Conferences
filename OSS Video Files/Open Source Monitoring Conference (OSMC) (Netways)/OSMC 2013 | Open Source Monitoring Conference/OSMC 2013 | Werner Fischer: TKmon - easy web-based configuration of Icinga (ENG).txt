Title: OSMC 2013 | Werner Fischer: TKmon - easy web-based configuration of Icinga (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07

Description: 
	Icinga and Nagios are very poplar throughout nearly all Linux sysadmins around the world. However, for sysadmins of other operating systems it was in the past difficult to install a Linux system and to set up Icinga with a reasonable configuration to monitor the sysadmin's network.
To overcome this burden, NETWAYS and Thomas Krenn have developed an easy-to-use web frontend, which allows every sysadmin to configure and use Icinga straightforward. TKmon's main features include showing the current service status, and setting up hosts, services and contacts. Extensible service catalogs allow the definition of services, so that they support optional parameters to be entered via TKmon's web interface. Additional features of TKmon are: network configuration, mail configuration, security configuration (to disable/enable direct access to Icinga or SSH), and a backup/restore function for the whole configuration. TKmon has been released under the GPL at this year's LinuxTag back in May. Since then, ready-to-use TKmon packages for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS are available at Thomas Krenn's repository  archive.thomas-krenn.com. A ISO image to install a Ubuntu 12.04 based TKmon appliance is also planned and should be available at OSMC. So now there is no reason anymore, why Windows sysadmins should not use Icinga ;-) Further information about TKmon can be found at:  http://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/TKmon
