Title: OSMC 2013| Oliver Hankeln: openTSDB - metrics for a distributed world (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2013 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	At gutefrage.net we like to measure everything - like the saying goes:
"what gets measured gets managed", we measure everything from server load to content generation to adsense income.
To store more than 100M data points for more than 2000 metrics per day, you need the right tool for the job. For us this is openTSDB.
In this talk I will give an overview over the architecture of openTSDB, compare it to other systems in the field, show how easy it is to gather new metrics and give advice on running the system and choosing metrics.
