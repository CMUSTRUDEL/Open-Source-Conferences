Publication date: 2016-12-12
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Most people who monitor the DNS do it from just one vantage point. But the result can depend a lot on where you are in the Internet, Routing issues blocking the name servers, censorship, lack of synchro between the servers, cache poisoning, are all reasons why results can be different depending on where you are.

We will explore the problem and propose solutions, such as the use of a distributed network of probes (RIPE Atlas), the recently appeared DNS looking glasses, and the infamous open resolvers.
