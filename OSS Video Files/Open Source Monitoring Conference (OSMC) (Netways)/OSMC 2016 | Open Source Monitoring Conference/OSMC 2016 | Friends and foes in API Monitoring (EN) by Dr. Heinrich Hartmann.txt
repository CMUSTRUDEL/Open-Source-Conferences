Title: OSMC 2016 | Friends and foes in API Monitoring (EN) by Dr. Heinrich Hartmann
Publication date: 2016-12-12
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	APIs are everywhere. In modern (micro) service oriented architectures they become the central entity that needs to be monitored. Questions that need to be answered include:

- Is user experience degraded for some of our customers?
- What is the likely cause of the service degradation?
- What are the business implications of a service degradation?

Answering these questions is not straight forward and requires careful choice of metrics, as well as awareness of several statistical pitfalls. In the talk, we will discuss several approaches for monitoring APIs, point out common missconceptions in reading API metrics and show how histograms can be used to extract correct and robust service level statistics from APIs.
