Title: OSMC 2016 | Metrics are for chumps (EN) by James Fryman
Publication date: 2016-12-12
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	At a conference like OSMC, it’s bewildering to hear that companies do not have ways to measure how their systems are performing. Yet, this is the norm. In our current economic climate, the argument to spend time instrumenting code and tooling seems counter-productive, and is often assigned the same priority that is placed on documentation (last, if at all). A vast number of reasons exist for why companies are *not* leveraging instrumentation, and inertia and lack of understanding only perpetuates this problem. In this talk, we will not spend time talking about an ideal infrastructure. Rather, we’ll spend time talking about how and why metrics implementations fail in the first place, and discuss some ways that you can overcome and find ultimate harmony within IT.

perfect speaker it's Jim's Fryman with

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:20,810
metrics are for chumps all right hello

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:23,180
and yeah yeah all right thank you um I

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,550
added some extra slides this morning you

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,839
know put the logo down here 40 smc

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,400
because that's where we're at and I also

00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,289
added some extra slides here which are

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
not here because this is the backup

00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,940
laptop so we're having a we're having

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,329
some fun today but what the slides

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,000
basically said before I dig into this um

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:44,360
you know first off Who am I my name is

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,899
James Fryman I'm a security practitioner

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,760
that got scared to infrastructure what I

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:52,640
mean by that is the better part of my

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,559
career getting started was spent in IT

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,500
security it's actually on the offensive

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,390
side and I spent most of my time hacking

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,379
into systems ethically of course you

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,770
know get permission and I quite enjoyed

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,910
that quite so much i even have tattoos

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,140
exploring exclaiming my love for

00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,869
security on my person and shortly after

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,970
i got said Ted 2 however my role changed

00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:20,090
and I turned into a compliance kind of

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,660
person and I found myself spending days

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,950
checking boxes we're compliant here

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,330
we're compliant here we're compliant

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,500
here the farthest away you could

00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:33,500
possibly get from offer overflow right I

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,440
said I can't do this anymore so made a

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,780
change one of those changes was I'm

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,860
gonna become an IT automation person I

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,470
mean heck I've been doing this

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,630
automation stuff for you know eight

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,209
years up to this point I like coding I

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,590
like breaking things I like automating

00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:51,170
because guess what I am a lazy

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,420
administrator does anybody subscribe to

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,849
the lazy admin school of thought good

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,860
good yes the less amount of work that

00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,179
you do the better right because then you

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,119
can sleep you can do a bunch of other

00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:06,440
cool things well anyways and my extra

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,869
slides in here before I kind of get into

00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,060
my presentation I'm going to take a

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,989
moment digress because it is my birthday

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,989
and I'm allowed

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,940
this year I ran a conference in

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,290
nashville tennessee called devops days

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,090
and the gentleman who convinced me to do

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,960
this standing right there in the back of

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:33,710
the room i naively thought this was

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,710
going to be easy yes he's laughing right

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:38,840
it's not right now getting speaking on

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,220
the road for about five years now and i

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,740
thought hey maybe I could just run a

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,710
conference no problem right I'll just

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,060
run a conference doesn't work that way

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,890
these things are hard to put together

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:55,730
very hard so my birthday wish from all

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,760
of you today go find an organizer give a

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,220
hug give me a handshake take a picture

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,990
of it hashtag thank an organizer with

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,480
osm scene they didn't ask me to do this

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,420
I have no relation in net ways you

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,890
should should these are awesome I'm glad

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,940
we're here thank you very much for

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,500
putting together so before I get started

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:19,970
just one more round of applause for the

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:22,640
guys here thank you very much all right

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,450
so let's actually talk about what it is

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,910
that I'm supposed to do why I'm here

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:32,870
this is my mission in life to enable

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,480
operations staff to sleep that's all I

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,690
want to do and that's you know partially

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,030
borne by a lot of lack of sleep on my

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,800
own part right and empathizing with the

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,260
human condition that sleep is something

00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,390
we all really like I don't know about

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,360
you but I spend about a third of my life

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,790
sleeping and I like that I like waking

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,320
up refreshed I like going to bed it's

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,959
something that I enjoy part of the human

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,400
condition well once I got into the from

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,890
the Securities position into an

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,780
Operations role that disappeared it's

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,300
sort of like having a child except every

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,520
night at 3am it was a phone call instead

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,440
of somebody crying and the difference

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,540
was is that at the time I had switched

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,310
you know you can sort of assume that

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,780
with a small child oh mature and they'll

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,840
start to understand things and no time

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,609
adapt with an IT organization you can't

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,780
make those assumptions right um no

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,490
matter how much energy and effort you

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,770
put into it sometimes there are things

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,080
that are stopping you from getting sleep

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,780
and sometimes they're the same things

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,130
over and over and over

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,100
and when I realize this this has became

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:40,760
my mission how do we make the repetitive

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:42,860
things go away because in my neck of the

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,990
woods Nashville Tennessee you know I

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,430
spent three or four years now in the

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,830
kind of bleeding edge everybody's

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,300
talking about all the cool new tools get

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,860
on the crew pernetti's and the Dockers

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,870
we got some instrumentation some

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,240
monitoring man this bleeding edge is so

00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,580
fun it's so awesome and then you go talk

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,740
to these people in my actual town and

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,340
there's seven to ten years away from

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,690
even thinking about that right I see

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,950
some of you laughin right your maybe

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,770
you're in an organization like this and

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,410
it's okay this presentation is geared

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,560
toward how do you convince those

00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,880
organizations those teams those leaders

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,910
that they should care about monitoring

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,070
they should care about instrumentation

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:26,000
because I have medical clients I have

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:30,490
large hospital chains and dotnet that's

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,860
a guess not a knock on the language but

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:36,770
something that has come from the dotnet

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,450
world very heavily in Nashville is the

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,330
msf framework of Microsoft solutions

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,190
framework and then that is very heavily

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,400
geared toward the wonderful waterfall

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,920
which means long projects scattered over

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,340
long amounts of time with lots of people

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,680
it's sort of in the antithesis of what

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,350
we want to try to get done here with dev

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:04,190
ops with instrumentation so it's a very

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:06,830
huge shift right and my conversations

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,530
usually go like this we set up

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,630
instrumentation oh yeah cool that's

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,160
awesome what'd you do uh you know we did

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,400
some librado maybe we set up some

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,870
graphite it was awesome yeah so how did

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,800
it go would you learn from it I'll we

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:24,110
toured out I want yeah you know we had a

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,490
problem and we couldn't really diagnose

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,830
whether or not it was caused by the time

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,850
solution time series database so you

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,620
know instead of trying to keep this

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,570
thing we just got rid of it because you

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,420
know we've been doing great so far we

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:40,670
don't need this it's fine what why why

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,400
and it's not just a like I said insert

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,590
weird excuse here because this

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,240
just one of them right all right you

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,550
know I've heard silly things like those

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,030
too complex which is a valid criticism

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,350
I've heard things like just don't have

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,750
time for it we're gonna dig into some of

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,820
these things here but usually this is

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,639
how it goes in my town somebody tried it

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,580
then they stopped and they don't have a

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,780
good reason why so why am i what am i

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,370
doing this why am I talking about this

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,889
cuz I'm selfish I'm lazy I'm selfish I'm

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,419
human right and I like to take advantage

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,370
of these things so i might one of my

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,900
favorite books is how to win friends and

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,010
influence people by dale carnegie and

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,639
one of the things that he says in there

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,410
is you have to be selfish to be selfless

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,770
so what I want to do is I want to create

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,520
environments that I want to go work at

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,010
that means i have to have these

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,250
conversations with new friends with old

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,080
friends with everybody because this is

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,400
not just oh i did a project and now we

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,770
have instrumentation right this is an

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,039
ongoing process and in this this is

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,620
adapted toward our auth 0 case which is

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,750
where i currently work i'm gonna tell

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,430
you about what we actually did so this

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,260
is this is interesting i'm going to talk

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,300
about the abstract and then I actually

00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,620
give you an example so when I first

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,250
started writing this presentation it was

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,990
actually very negative very negative it

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,669
was geared toward all of the excuses

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,020
that I had ever heard about implementing

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,840
instrumentation she's going to be like a

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,639
an attack deck a positive attack deck

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,070
but something that just talks to you

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,840
about like we're the problems well in

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,699
the middle of this while I'm writing

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,650
this presentation we actually had a

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,560
success using the things I'm going to

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,260
talk about here so hopefully we'll put a

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,659
positive twist on it and show you how

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:33,150
things can actually get done all right

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:36,039
so what's the story we had a customer

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,950
came to his it off to your own said we

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,130
love you guys actually first of all off

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,770
zero online software as a service

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,420
authentication authorization 10 minutes

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,370
away include a library in your language

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,610
of choice and boom we got it for you

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,140
it's cool not gonna lie and a big

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,690
customer came to us which we actually

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,620
signed they're excited about that I'm

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,980
bearing the lead here

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,270
it's important the King doesn't said run

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,730
we like you guys we like everything

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:10,750
about you but we're big rear big can you

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,550
handle what kind of load we're gonna

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,589
send to you so you're sure 3500 requests

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,250
per second that's a respectable number

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:21,790
that's a big number okay so go back turn

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,550
around the team talk to the CTO well

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:28,390
what can we actually do today about 500

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,279
requests per second okay okay all right

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,970
so that's a gap it's called an

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:39,160
exponential gap how long do we have to

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:41,410
do this two weeks oh cool so we have two

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,180
weeks to apply science that's a little

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:52,750
microbe microscope here if you can't see

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:56,020
it the moji some emoji in this so we

00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:00,460
have two weeks to make this thing work

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:03,550
what do we do the first step is recon

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,100
right try to understand what has been

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,050
done up to the point when you enter

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,760
right it's very rare you're gonna walk

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,760
into a Greenfield situation and if you

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,580
do god bless you right go make that

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,339
happen but ninety-nine percent of the

00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,410
time something has been done already you

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,750
gotta go find out what has been done

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,029
what positive things have happened what

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,529
negative things have happened what has

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,640
caused them to be where they're

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,520
currently at with regard to

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,459
instrumentation in the case of our zero

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,550
they'd already tried this they went

00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:37,839
through implemented liberato put it all

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,529
throughout their metrics tack took the

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,589
time then they had an outage and another

00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,140
outage and there at the time we were in

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:51,220
a hyper growth state constantly

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:55,000
constantly growing and so they didn't

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,150
know what to do this thing right we put

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,050
it in now we have problems we're going

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,270
to take it out and they did so they

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,730
detected it and then took it out because

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,170
they didn't understand it very well they

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,889
didn't have time to understand it very

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,089
well right they have

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,739
business demands that are being placed

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,720
on them they have customers are trying

00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:17,329
to satisfy they're trying to make enough

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,309
money to make it to the next day so you

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,049
can I can be upset about this and it's

00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,029
okay they can be upset about that that's

00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,739
okay but they had to make a business

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:26,419
decision in understanding that's

00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:29,839
important and it will actually come into

00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,399
play later in the Ozzie row story but

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,850
make sure you understand what's been

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,149
done do the Recon why is your company at

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:41,720
the current place it currently is and

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:44,779
then make the case breathing one in this

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,149
microphone sorry by it's no joke I

00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,819
actually really debated putting this

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,949
slide in because it's so cliche oh you

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:55,970
gotta get buy-in from the top yea orsa

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:59,059
won't happen well it's true it's you

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:02,059
have to I've worked at a company that

00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,980
makes DevOps tools that the CTO was not

00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:08,839
on board with this and so it didn't

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,779
happen okay everybody's got to be on

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,089
board not one liter not two liters not

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:15,860
three liters all your leaders and they

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,059
got to know why you're doing this right

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,790
we're talk about some of the reasons

00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,679
that's important to them right but

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,239
everybody's got to be on board with this

00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,529
or else it's going to get ripped out

00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:31,100
sewn up step one step two make the case

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:32,839
recon make the case get your buy-in and

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,850
this is the conversation that you need

00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,309
to happen have when should it happen

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:40,970
this is always the big question with

00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:45,079
with business people right this is the

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,019
DevOps hierarchy of needs yeah that's

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,869
right yeah look at this and it talks

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:52,429
about these multiple layers right the

00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:53,980
very bottom our foundation we spend a

00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,279
lot of time talking about this

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,480
acceptance learning tolerance

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,649
experimentation and all these wonderful

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,199
feel good things that we talked about

00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,660
that enable all of the other things to

00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,309
occur however what ends up happening is

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,619
everybody's excited to get to this

00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:11,779
continuous delivery portion it's a race

00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,759
to the top because if we can just get to

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:15,199
continuous delivery boy everything will

00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,629
be fine cuz right it's at the top of the

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,779
triangle that's where everybody wants to

00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:22,339
be self-realized DevOps style the

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,390
problem is is if you miss these things

00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:26,210
underway

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,210
well you have a house of cards so where

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:32,930
does monitoring fallen step to

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,090
understanding understanding a process

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,790
appreciation considering for security

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:39,590
logging and reporting you can't get

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:44,630
better with improvement if you have no

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:47,780
way to measure it it's part two so some

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,500
excuses it's not the most important

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,860
feature to work on except it is the most

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,300
important feature to work on how do you

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,160
measure success otherwise if you don't

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,960
have some sort of instrumentation some

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,800
sort of monitoring there's a real cool

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,800
story i was reading the other day about

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,020
a race car and they spent hundreds of

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,520
thousands of dollars on this race car to

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,500
make it go faster and they ended up

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,090
putting new tires on it well imagine if

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,140
you built this thing and you went

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,120
through all this rd and all this

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,870
research and just stuck it on the road

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,160
and said it's faster now who would

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:29,600
accept that but we do it all the time

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:35,360
all the time which is that's better it's

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,040
faster now let's go that's that's

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,630
difficult how do you actually tell

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,250
whether you were successful that's where

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,440
you get into feelings and emotions and

00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,540
who's buddy up with who in the company

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,220
that's not how I want to run so how I

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,380
want to work when I have data-driven

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,380
conversations you can't have that

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,490
without data so when somebody says

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,440
what's the most important feature to

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,850
work on you say it's the most important

00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,610
feature to work on so we know all the

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,870
features are working well with our users

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,580
are using them where there are ya

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,350
whether our users are using them whether

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,150
they're running performant tons of

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:13,880
things you have to know you have to

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,020
measure we can't start until we

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,200
understand the data retention

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,420
requirements yeah I heard of chuckle

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,800
over here that one's happened right this

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,800
is this is a common pushback from

00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,270
security operations teams because you

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,490
know if we start collecting the data

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,230
well now we have to save it for seven

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:34,280
years we have to most the time you don't

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,480
most the time you don't the data we're

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,250
talking about here does

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,410
pii doesn't have health care data

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:45,019
associated with it doesn't credit cards

00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:46,310
its numbers numbers and so when somebody

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,199
comes to you can tell I'm sorry that's a

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,510
premature optimization we don't even

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,949
have it yet we have no idea how much

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,149
we're going to collect because you don't

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:54,709
usually when you're implementing this

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,019
thing even no idea what your ingestion

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,389
rates going to be and often you throw

00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,889
too much at it to begin with well if

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,449
you're experimenting and then you throw

00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,930
this common block in front of you but

00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:08,540
you're never going to get started cuz

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,550
you know how do you save data for seven

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,050
years and most of time companies haven't

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:16,699
solved that one either yeah go figure

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:23,329
it's a premature optimization right

00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:25,570
fight it we don't run a SAS this is my

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,949
favorite one I hear this all the time

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,300
all this cool dev ops stuff that you

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,850
guys are doing oh that's just for

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:36,949
websites and stuff we're an enterprise

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:39,560
or we build on pram software or whatever

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:42,709
we're not a SAS so it's different for us

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,949
it doesn't matter well that's goofy to

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,180
write like what I don't understand that

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:49,610
and it's especially prevalent with

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,980
on-premise software and that's super

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,329
confusing to me because guess what let's

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,449
say you release some software into the

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:58,540
wild and then inevitably it will happen

00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:00,980
you'll get a phone call that it broke

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:05,360
cuz nothing's perfect so it will fall

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,589
over not win if or not if when and if

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,299
you have no way to measure it how are

00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,790
you going to know if what they're

00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,530
telling you is to is right or not right

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,299
you're not gonna have anything but he

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,250
said she said whether your appliance is

00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,419
running properly or not and nine times

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,939
out of ten they're gonna win because

00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:21,770
they're giving you money right if you've

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,870
got no way to defend yourself the best

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,230
you've got us customer service that's

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,660
okay but it's not it's okay in the sense

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,400
that we understand why people think like

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,590
this but the mindsets got to change

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,940
right these are common practices that

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,070
you can do regardless of whether you're

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,980
in a SAS regardless of whether you're

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,610
running on Prem software right make it

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,530
available know what happens after you

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,049
ship a feature know what your up take

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,620
your performance even if you're on Prem

00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,380
even a

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,330
here in enterprise with only servicing

00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,080
your internal customers it matters it

00:17:53,330 --> 00:18:02,390
matters you know we've made good

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,430
decisions up to this point so we don't

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,900
need monitoring our gut has got us this

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:11,930
far you'll get us further this is a link

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,540
to an article that basically talks about

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,370
how most people in IT have never

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:22,309
participated in a successful project

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,230
ever it even talks about a high

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:27,410
percentage a little less than twenty

00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:30,200
percent but still very high that these

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,500
projects are fatal not just they fail

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,480
they killed the company that's

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,030
significant amount of mind blow there

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,380
and so when somebody says hey you know

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,270
we've made good decisions up to this

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,559
point you can sort of you know backtrack

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,720
it with the decision talks that we made

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,250
up to this point and also say you know

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,740
you need to make decisions based on

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,170
knowledge not intuition or locking that

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,750
will only get you so far entropy is only

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:57,320
on your side for so long right chaos

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:59,480
theory only works so often how then are

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,030
you going to take advantages you can get

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,800
and leverage them to your benefit right

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,510
it's hard enough to run a business it's

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,850
hard enough to know what your customers

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,590
are going to want how to grow but if

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,530
you're just going by your gut the whole

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,880
time somebody who's got data is gonna

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:20,000
come and overtake it pretty quickly I

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:25,880
promise happens every time you gotta

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,380
line your incentives I like to align my

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,160
incentives with something that matters

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,140
to me sleep I like to sleep I like my

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,110
staff to sleep I like my friends to

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,340
sleep now business leaders they don't

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,980
want to hear hey I just want to go to

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:43,940
bed right they want to hear other things

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,920
like how's my feature doing how's my

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,170
response time in my page loading going

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,000
what's my cost per unit or per

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,800
transaction this is the language that

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,690
they work in and then they care about

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,630
what about the language that we care

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,270
about decreasing mttr mean time to

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,370
restore me time respond finding

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,580
bottlenecks in your system fixing

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,679
problems before they become

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,679
or understanding seasonality for

00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:10,019
capacity planning let's put sleep in

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,450
front of all of these and it will work I

00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,980
want to sleep more and that I will sleep

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,649
more by decreasing my mean time to

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,690
restore and respond I will sleep more by

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,120
finding bottlenecks before they become

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,950
promise I will sleep more understanding

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,980
the seasonality for my capacity planning

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,750
you sir or madam whoever your bosses you

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,760
will sleep more because you'll know your

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,549
features being tracked right you will

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,470
sleep more because the we know how

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:36,000
people are consuming it and will you'll

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,240
sleep better because you know how your

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,139
money is being spent sleeps fundamental

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,120
not going to lie about that going to

00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:43,620
keep coming back to this but align your

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,049
incentives right find a language that

00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,049
matters to both you and your leaders

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,480
really just got to put developers on

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,130
call and quick show of hands who works

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,960
in an organization that has developers

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:07,230
on call that is a sad state of affairs

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,820
ladies and gentlemen because you know

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,130
that DevOps wall there's a wall here

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,809
it's imaginary wall right the DevOps one

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,110
they throw stuff over and then who's

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:20,279
responsible for it right the developers

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:26,190
Yolo they ship it's fine I'm out opps

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:28,380
turned Yolo hashtag Yolo um this is hard

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,639
right because you know usually you have

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,399
to have some sort of authority or power

00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:34,830
to do this or influence to say hey we

00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:38,700
need developers be on call but here's

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,380
the thing there's a new model that's

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,269
been rising for the less you know it's

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,880
called 10 or 15 years called the site

00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,460
reliability engineer right that person

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,799
that role can be on pram can be off pram

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,210
can be whatever but their goal is to be

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,130
the sort of bridge between the people

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,429
who don't want to do operations the

00:21:53,130 --> 00:22:00,870
people who don't want to do development

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:03,870
and it sounds like DevOps right I think

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,299
sre is sort of the closest job title

00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,549
toward what DevOps could be or should be

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:12,659
or a good example of what we've got at

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:14,970
this point but the sre requires having

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,800
understanding about how to code right

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,450
has

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,190
understanding about you know hey when

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,170
something breaks I'm not gonna spend

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,320
another three five ten minutes to call

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,940
somebody who could fix this right I have

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,100
knowledge about how to read stack traces

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,720
I have knowledge about how to push code

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,230
I have knowledge about how to fix the

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,400
thing right so not everybody's there yet

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,800
not everybody needs site reliability

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,730
engineers but everybody needs developers

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,200
to be around right and a be on call

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:46,730
because guess what developers they like

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,710
sleep to go figure right and the second

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,870
you put somebody who has the ability to

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,820
code in front of a problem that big

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,910
problem that it interrupts their sleep

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,360
guess what will happen they will fix it

00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,850
thank you right so this is sort of a you

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,650
can look at this a couple ways right the

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,350
first way is you need partners you need

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,880
to make sure that you have cooperation

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,690
with more than just your operations

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,460
staff right availability is a team sport

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,750
but it can also be looked at as you know

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,400
if you don't know how to code you don't

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,570
know how to operate you don't know how

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,470
to read stack traces that might be

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,930
something you want to get good head

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,950
right this is where it's going right is

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,870
not trying to find ways for big large

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,840
teams because availability settling

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:33,200
matters all the time right 99.99 that's

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,030
sort of a standard and that's 18 24

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,380
minutes of downtime a month then you

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,930
throw another night on there oh my gosh

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,790
right you need to have people who can

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,650
respond and understand the core dumps

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,880
that come out of this thing not just

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,080
your operators who are going around

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,290
going hope I can keep some

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,360
infrastructure up right it's a non-ideal

00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,850
you can get by with it a lot of people

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,440
do but have the real conversation with

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,450
your leaders put developers on call

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,350
you'll be amazed at what happens pin

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,570
based and you have to be opportunistic

00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,640
right so this is the slide that got

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,790
added as my my presentation turned from

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,060
super salty angry too oh my gosh success

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,190
yay success is often planning ninety

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,870
percent of planning and then you have to

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,790
incorporate that timing and luck factor

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,310
into it right finding opportunities

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:23,360
we're accelerating efforts associated

00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:25,070
key components are moved up so in the op

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,370
0 case right they knew they wanted

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,330
metrics they tried once they didn't have

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,910
success

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,230
but they knew they wanted it and we were

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,590
in the middle of planning it's sort of

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,990
my like second month the company at the

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,640
time so still getting my hands about you

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,830
know what's going on here right what

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,420
what is this system actually doing and

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,170
we're putting together a plan here's

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,310
what's going to take to put

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,800
instrumentation in different parts of

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,810
the parts of the system well then are

00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,460
our big challenge came hey you know

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:59,690
increase your speed your performance by

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:01,760
a factor of ten cool well guess what we

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,620
had a plan was already sort of build it

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,380
wasn't fleshed out completely but it was

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,110
an idea and so when the opportunity came

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,270
and needed to happen well holy cow now

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,490
you're prepared right and that's exactly

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,630
what happened here is we went to and say

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,640
okay wet this big challenge how we're

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,620
gonna do it and we're sort of on the

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,340
path already not officially but you know

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:26,000
on the way boom throw down that plan two

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,110
weeks right be opportunistic find the

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,510
things that you care about in your

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,780
company right put together small little

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,910
I don't know thought balloons small

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,790
documents whatever sort of get your

00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,710
company's minds working right and be

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,450
prepared to have the conversations

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,700
because there will be a point when

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,230
something that you care about like med

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,300
cert metrics and instrumentation comes

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,720
up and will be necessary and you can

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:57,350
just go and be the be the person be the

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:59,120
man be the woman then gotta pick your

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,280
tool set and this is this is where

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,650
starts to get fuzzy right and there's a

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,990
couple approaches to this in-house and

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,100
SAS I mean that's sort of self self

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,990
explanatory at this point in the world

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,000
right but this is where you lose people

00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,590
a lot right because it's difficult to

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,080
loot to unlearn it's difficult to

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,820
understand there's so many moving parts

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,340
to this thing right have who's put

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,930
together an instrumentation stack could

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:27,140
be a tick stack a graphite stack 12 okay

00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:30,650
hmm who would say it was the most

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,530
pleasant thing they ever did okay okay

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,170
cool um who would say it was not the

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,750
most pleasant thing than if they did

00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:42,490
okay an even split masochists are over

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,160
here Satan oh the

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:47,410
the challenge is when you have a

00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,610
stressed team a stressed operations team

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,559
of stress development team stress

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,840
anything you say i'm going to add

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,400
something it could be anything and it

00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,530
could make their life better they're

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,660
immediately going to reject it I've got

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,240
too much things going on to learn a new

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,220
thing I can't plan for this I don't even

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,620
know how it's going to work right it's

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:08,140
it's sort of the fear of adding more

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,460
burden to the operation staff right and

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,670
that's that's understandable it's

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,460
there's a lot going on but you got to be

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,440
prepared about how to attack it right so

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,540
on the in-house side it does get

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,570
confusing not gonna lie about this but

00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,070
you know resource costs matter right one

00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,540
of the decisions that we made about this

00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,400
is how long is it going to take for us

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,070
to actually get a monitoring stack up

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:34,390
and running in our case we only had two

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:37,360
weeks right putting this up in two weeks

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,070
or actually less than two weeks so that

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,020
we can actually spend the time doing the

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,670
analysis that's pretty tough right

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,350
because you got to pick some amount of

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,080
gatherers and you could use one or many

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,059
depending on your you know state you

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,040
could use one or many listeners one of

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,780
many backends one of many renders and

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,660
this is just some of the tools it's not

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,040
even the full space and so when you ask

00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,800
somebody like you know how do you get

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,550
data from your system all the way to

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:05,559
presentation right it's difficult right

00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,790
it's hard there's a lot of steps there's

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,370
a lot of money to be made in fixing this

00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:12,700
if you have an opportunity but it's a

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,880
it's a valid push back right which is

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,650
where you get the SAS solution right

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,429
somebody has done something for you you

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,920
know throw money at the problem in

00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:26,020
return they'll give you advancements

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,600
maybe that advancement is the dashboard

00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,510
or the collection agent or pre-made

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:35,110
graphs or any number of things right

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:38,260
this is sort of where you have to like

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,270
you know manage people time right in the

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,670
case of you know a full-time in-house

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,590
solution you all have to need a person

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,320
working on this a full person all the

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,610
time not just to you know keep it up and

00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,170
running but to you know make sure that

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,540
there's somebody there to help with

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,220
ingestion and and help with renders

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,850
there's a lot of bootstrap associated

00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,100
with that

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,870
versus a SAS solution often that

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,700
bootstrap time is significantly cut it

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,590
doesn't solve the how do I leverage

00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,270
instrumentation problem but it does

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,980
solve the how do I get started problem

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,890
and this is the path that we chose

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:13,090
ultimately it at all 0 we only had two

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:15,760
weeks right which means we had days

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,950
really less than days to figure out what

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,800
our stack was and then some amount of

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:23,380
days remaining two weeks minus n days to

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,960
actually do performance analysis so

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,180
we--we data dog we move it dated on

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,730
because it was the furthest along the

00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:34,330
path for us it gave us the collection

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,670
agents it gave us the dashboards it

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,200
basically made it so that you could put

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,790
something in front of somebody who's

00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,980
never seen instrumentation and go

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,230
there's some data they may not know what

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:50,500
they're looking at yet but it shows up

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:53,950
very quickly very easily now we also

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,470
designed this because cost matters this

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,580
is expensive right and that's that's the

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,400
sort of trade off right you throwing

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,130
money for for some amount of risk taken

00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,510
off of you and in the case of data dog

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,880
it actually represents a third of our

00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,610
optics costs for four operations a month

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,440
that's a lot that's after negotiation

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,210
but that was an acceptable business risk

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,010
for us at that time right we didn't have

00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:20,740
time to dilly-dally but what it allowed

00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:22,750
us to do is say alright we have to sign

00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,970
for a year have to in order to get a

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,460
decent rate that we can reasonably be

00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,170
okay with in that year we're going to

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,100
learn a lot about our instrumentation

00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,600
stay we're going to learn a lot about

00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,200
our system going to learn a lot about a

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,510
lot of things and we ultimately want to

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,460
fall back to this all right we want to

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,280
bring it back in-house because you know

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,900
who owns your availability me right or

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,360
you depending on who's asking the

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:49,420
question you these this guy two thumbs

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,510
owns availability so we actually built a

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,430
shim layer before we release this to our

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,800
development staff that basically

00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,570
abstracted the the logging the

00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,450
monitoring the metrics called the aussie

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,300
row instrumentation library and all it

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,330
did was you know hey here's a thin

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,680
wrapper and now it's available using all

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,159
our common conventions that developers

00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,649
can

00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,119
right great very important I make it

00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,460
frictionless make it easy for people to

00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,379
consume but it's also designed in such a

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,330
way that at some point we can go we're

00:31:17,379 --> 00:31:21,789
done with this right our 12 months is

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,799
elapsed we don't want to pay a third of

00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:25,899
our op X cost any more let's bring it in

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,509
house and as far as the developers are

00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:29,979
concerned nothing changes right because

00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:32,799
all the calls that have been assigned

00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:34,450
the you know send data here log thing

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,220
here it's already abstracting our small

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,450
shim right took about a day and a half

00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,729
to put together but it was worth the

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,590
effort because now we can change things

00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:48,429
underneath the hood and developer hasn't

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:49,779
knows it on the difference right yeah I

00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:51,460
think I talked about this already right

00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:54,070
the analytics portions where you get

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,809
more than just the logging right LeBron

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,840
0 gives you the hey I've got a place to

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,580
put it but you know these tools data dog

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,509
New Relic appdynamics there's more

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,429
they'll give you the the more the I

00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:08,259
installed the engine next plug-in what's

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:10,330
it doing now oh here's my requests I

00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,769
installed the H a plug eh a proxy

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,749
plug-in here's what's happening there I

00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:15,879
installed the docker plugin etc etc

00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:18,220
right you get some amount of basic

00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,409
analysis out-of-the-box enough that you

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,330
can start the troubleshooting not enough

00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,799
where you can get full understanding you

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,229
don't just put new relic in and then

00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,690
everything's fancy and fine right you

00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:33,279
get some visibility and then you got to

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:35,979
go tweakin tune right so this is what we

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,249
ultimately picked in the end right and

00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:41,729
I'll talk about why we talked about the

00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:44,379
cost of the solutions the tech debt tax

00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:46,929
you know third of the cost op X for data

00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:50,049
dog worth it trade off to begin with but

00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:52,330
not long term the monitoring stack we

00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:54,009
talked about with our we have data dog

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,859
in our own homegrown tool and this is

00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:59,679
actually being phased out pure for data

00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:01,269
dot right logging we already had a

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,479
Kinetoscope on a pipeline that was set

00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:08,139
up and century as an exception handling

00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:09,340
tool that we introduced in order to get

00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:11,379
some visibility into the things we

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,720
didn't know about right all of these are

00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:15,039
wrapped all of these are wrapped in a

00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,989
thing called the author your

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,309
instrumentation library that sends it to

00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:20,590
these different things until we can swap

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:23,500
out the back end as as as

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,090
we wish as we wish now we chose a couple

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,549
of these right talk about data dog is

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,070
that it has a stats d connector dog

00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:31,450
stats d so you can sort of already begin

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,000
to use the same conventions that you

00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,980
would normally do in house it's just a

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,200
swap out right there's a big reason we

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,559
chose data dog or say like app dynamics

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,549
or New Relic we chose century for the

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,770
exception handling I know there's a

00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,750
couple of those and I do have a slight

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,460
bias I know the guy who founded it he

00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,289
worked at github so I kind of know it's

00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,659
going to be a good product but they also

00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:54,460
offer in on prime solution and so

00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:55,899
following the same line of reasoning

00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,090
that we ultimately want to bring this

00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:59,559
back in-house when we chose century

00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,720
because at some point we could just put

00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:03,580
the on-prem version up repoint where the

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,490
target is and now we've got it in house

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,659
right maybe grandiose thinking but we're

00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:12,760
going down this path and is still

00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:15,580
working well for us and you have to

00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:21,190
iterate right this is this is the

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:23,980
hardest thing because you know most most

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:27,490
companies nowadays in the very you know

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,679
day week month project based we're done

00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,200
we may implemented metrics it's

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,270
wonderful it's fantastic we can go do

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,149
something else now and that's that's not

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,869
how it works with this right you have to

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,550
constantly iterate you have to

00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,750
constantly take measurement of what's

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,210
going on because you're constantly

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,310
making changes right but in the same

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,720
vein right you don't boil the ocean you

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,179
make small iterative changes as you

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,280
learn small things about new feature X

00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,830
or old feature why you make small

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,970
adjustments and you see with your

00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:59,800
monitoring what the changes are and this

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,650
is where the PDCA cycle comes through a

00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,810
plan do check act right it's totally

00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,730
fine if you're trying to implement this

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,609
and a feedback loop doesn't exist yet

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,680
most places it won't right because you

00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:14,250
know you reach the finish line and then

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,900
we're off to the races something new but

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,970
the first implementation is is very much

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,530
a first hammer and give a I don't know I

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,410
don't want to repeat my hammer store

00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:28,420
who's hurt my hammer story okay good all

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:30,730
right so uh hammers right um I have a

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,560
colleague who has a blacksmith friend

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,390
and he went over one day and said hey I

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,940
want to make something said great

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,049
a hammer so they sat down the thing I

00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,230
spent some time and they made a hammer

00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:42,490
and I was like awesome I'm gonna go make

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,720
something I said no we're gonna make a

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,519
hammer what do you mean I got this

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,980
hammer here so no that's the hammer

00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,240
gonna use to make the hammer oh okay say

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,279
take the first hammer there's a very

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,630
rudimentary one this first hammer and

00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:55,470
they use that one to make a second one

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,640
my buddy's like okay great fantastic

00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,549
let's go do something let's go make

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,930
something know we're making a hammer

00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:03,010
take the second hammer and you build the

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,839
thing that you ultimately want the

00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,400
hammer that gets used to go and build

00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,809
other things right you don't just start

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,970
out with a hammer you have to iterate

00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:11,529
and so when you look at this look at it

00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,559
as your first hammer this is the thing

00:36:11,529 --> 00:36:17,079
that will give you the ability to grow

00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:18,730
right it has to be your first cycle and

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,170
you have to know you're going into more

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,430
you have to know that you're going to

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,650
come out with a better hammer out of

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,609
this right your leaders need to know

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,079
this your team's need to know this

00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:31,539
whatever you do spend time learning

00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,089
about deployment friction and spin

00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:36,010
cycles they're right because any time

00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,390
that you run into friction associated

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,130
with this you're going to get pushed

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,460
back that's the first thing to attack

00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,930
the detractors any sort of friction

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,769
because if you can't get past that then

00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,119
you can't have higher order

00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,619
conversations about what is my

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:55,559
instrumentation and monitoring actually

00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:58,529
doing right so phase one bootstrap phase

00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,069
here's what we did it off zero we

00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:03,069
programmatically build our test

00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:07,029
environment we measured key control

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:08,950
points and we tested testing prepared

00:37:07,029 --> 00:37:10,359
and data flowing to key points I did

00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,869
really bad with those points I'm very

00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:15,640
sorry the the general phases we created

00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,500
a new environment we implement our

00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,930
tooling we try to figure out where it is

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,299
that data actually kind of would get

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:24,789
blocked would get stopped up right and

00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:26,380
for us that was oh actually I'm going to

00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:29,049
not go into that quite yet let me go

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,349
into the phases so you know find your

00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:34,059
choke points measure at key points and

00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:36,839
then start to do tests the second phase

00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:39,220
for us was iteration right do testing

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,250
run tell exhaustion find your choke

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:44,140
points build dashboards speed up and in

00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,490
the third place is ability to

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,710
dynamically add resources to each

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,130
component figure out what your actual

00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:51,220
cape

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,570
the eyes are iterate test time right go

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,810
to your thing so let's talk about this

00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,640
in the ethereal world we we built a test

00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,500
environment we we threw data dog

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,490
everywhere and then we said where are

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,700
the places where things would

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:08,590
traditionally fall apart and that would

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:14,890
be okay I lost a slide in when you dick

00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:16,780
em handoff right database hands

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,760
off middle to your hand off right

00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,380
somewhere one system starts to talk to

00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,270
another those are common control points

00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,250
right test to see whether what you

00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,980
expect coming out going into the next

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:29,470
system is the same the same volume

00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,890
frequency requests whatever the thing

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,930
you're measuring is right and we also

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,740
started to actually create you know with

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,030
the basic dashboards where was it that

00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:43,920
we wanted to measure for us it was

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,970
capturing requests per second right so

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,710
you know maybe something different for

00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,710
you but requests per second for us is

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:53,980
you know mostly the front end right and

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,180
then is my H a proxy tier is it is it

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,410
giving the amount of requests that I

00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,270
expect right so we have a baseline that

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,070
we want to have coming in and you want

00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,050
to see at each point where does it where

00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:12,310
does a tail off let me see if I got

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:13,870
actually talking about this um no well

00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,000
let's just skip it where can things go

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,140
still wrong right let's save done all

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,880
this cool stuff and you've implemented

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,860
it your some of the things are going to

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,470
get is you know what we have is good

00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:26,410
enough right logging is often cited as

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,790
being good enough if I have logging it's

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,370
just fine I don't need anymore

00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:32,800
instrumentation well this assumes a

00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,890
couple things right it seems that number

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,380
one you have the ability to find a

00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,490
needle in a haystack right that is an

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,510
amazing skill and if you have the

00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,720
ability to do that please I would like

00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:45,310
to talk to you afterwards but you need

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,780
some sort of telemetry to actually

00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,720
narrow down events from your system

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,640
right at some point some event occurs

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,170
how are you going to narrow down to it

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,400
the timeframe that it occurred and we're

00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,740
actually go and find out what the

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,630
logging information is it also assumes

00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,700
that you've done due diligence to make

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,809
sure that everything is logged and like

00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,999
guarantee you that

00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,430
a false statement right there is

00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:08,109
something that will not log that will

00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,119
cause a problem in your environment so

00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:15,099
you can never say logging is enough like

00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:17,670
if you go back to our stack right this

00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,719
stack includes four pieces right

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,880
instrumentation about how things are

00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:25,029
going status about whether things are up

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,999
or down information on Arion issues as

00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:29,859
there occurred and then all of the oil

00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:32,499
rest of everything else the unknown

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,150
unknowns right the four dimensions here

00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,279
we're capturing not just one not just

00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,890
logging this actually took a lot of

00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:40,989
discussion about because logging will

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,239
get you a law a long way it really will

00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:44,259
right you can go a long way digging

00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,509
through logs and trying to find

00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:47,979
seasonality through the mountain of log

00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:49,869
events that you possibly can arm

00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:52,239
engineers were really good at it but

00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:56,140
they were really good at confirmation

00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:58,539
bias where they sort of came up with a

00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:02,249
theory and then use the logs to explain

00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:04,719
it as opposed to finding actual data and

00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:07,900
digging in and reproducing and going

00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,519
forward right it's okay that you know if

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,719
you're at this point right again

00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,150
understand this these are like

00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:15,009
evolutions these are growth patterns but

00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,079
you need to make the case it having one

00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:23,109
thing is not enough you need more

00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:25,739
visibility the second thing you got to

00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:29,369
keep in sync with the developers right

00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:33,670
we actually had some failures here

00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:36,279
change is difficult and even with the

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:42,119
most well-intentioned people you will

00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:44,460
encounter resistance right with us

00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,670
everybody's really excited about doing

00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,809
this in fact there were actually there

00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,759
were two factions let me kind of back up

00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,109
there was one faction of folks that had

00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,460
been around for the first implementation

00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:56,039
that were very negative on the whole

00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,499
experience we implemented librado it

00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:00,089
caused failures before literally I was

00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:03,690
asked what makes you think it's going to

00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:05,759
work this time okay well that's that's a

00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:07,380
very harsh criticism but let's let's see

00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,730
what can happen you know in that case I

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,890
basically had to say you got to kind of

00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,089
trust me that's not an answer the

00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,980
developers always want to hear right

00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:15,509
what they want to hear is how are you

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:19,289
going to be there for them when things

00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:21,680
go down right in our case we put data

00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:26,430
dog in we got instant availability and

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,039
invisibility but then it was well how do

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:31,410
I interpret this how do i add

00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,700
measurement points to my system what are

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,499
these measurement points what's the

00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,249
difference between you know a counter

00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:41,220
and a histogram and a and a any of the

00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:45,059
other kind of pieces well we were so

00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,859
busy with with other things going on we

00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:48,599
sort of neglected this part and it

00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,309
almost fell apart just because of this

00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,349
because the developers lost confidence

00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:55,259
we've only got two weeks we have this

00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,630
big coin in front of us and I don't feel

00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:59,309
comfortable that's stuff it's tough to

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,410
hear because you know we're trying to

00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,630
introduce data into this and now we're

00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,160
talking about feelings but you have to

00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,769
hear the people that you're working with

00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,710
why are they giving you push back where

00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:13,710
is that coming from I understand

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,420
internalize it and act on it quickly or

00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,819
else you're the detractors are going to

00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,890
become problems for you right as the

00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:22,440
people with influence go this is not

00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,329
working I'm out right once you learn

00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,190
lose the you know the one or two people

00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,960
on your team that you know like hey if

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,289
this person accepts our denies it's

00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,210
going to go right you wanna I mean I'm

00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:34,559
very customer focused in the sense that

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,119
you want to have teammates and you want

00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,650
to have people that you that you're that

00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,869
you're you know excited to work with

00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:42,089
that that that you can make sure that

00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:43,559
they're successful so make sure you're

00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:45,059
paying attention make sure you're paying

00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,539
attention the success of the project

00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:50,039
lies in the by off from everybody get

00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:51,779
the acceptance from the top and get the

00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:54,289
acceptance from the bottom everybody's

00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:54,289
got to be in

00:43:57,019 --> 00:44:03,059
and this is where we ran into problems

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:06,630
right we the entertain interpretation

00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:09,359
was just bad we had a resource dedicated

00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:10,680
to it but for one reason or another we

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,910
just weren't able to allocate time with

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:19,789
him with the right people what ended up

00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:23,279
helping us in saving us was in the end

00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:26,099
there to do actually I kind of deter to

00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:27,930
track a little bit we started to lose

00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,339
confidence our developers and they went

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,690
and started to try to figure out if they

00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:32,220
could create their own tooling right

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,339
using a bee or something else to get

00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,660
some instrumentation and and that's okay

00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,130
right you want competition for your

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,420
stack you want to know whether you can

00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,279
learn something from them or they can

00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,839
learn something from you and after a

00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:46,529
couple days they were able to get some

00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,299
visibility and some confidence in data

00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:49,739
point just because they had built it but

00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,239
it still didn't match up with all of the

00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:53,369
other data points from everywhere else

00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,440
and this is important right because it

00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:58,440
won't in the beginning in the beginning

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,900
you won't have any idea what is going on

00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,059
right you have to sort of make a

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,359
decision about what cardinal point zero

00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:08,489
is going to be and iterate on that not

00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:11,309
trying to make your tools line or fix

00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:14,279
themselves but make a decision this is

00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:17,009
now zero point we want to increase from

00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:20,130
0 to n whether n is more transactions

00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:22,619
more more performant data whatever and

00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:26,640
then iterate as you refine as you get to

00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,170
your third hammer right now the other

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,049
thing is troubleshooting methodology is

00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:33,450
largely unknown this sort of surprises

00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:34,739
me but not right when when we're

00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,720
constantly being pushed to feature

00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:38,849
feature feature feature feature there's

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,499
not a lot of time to spend in learning

00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,390
troubleshooting methodology right which

00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:44,910
is why having the developers on calls

00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,710
often a hard kind of discussion to have

00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,529
right well how do i make features if i

00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,779
don't know if my developers are on call

00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:54,329
well this is sort of where you can kind

00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:57,070
of come in when I got started with ite

00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,660
ops one

00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,480
the things that I was recommended to do

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,370
was learn the OSI model right has a lot

00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,310
to do with networking you can sort of

00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:08,290
take the the layers and mala to other

00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,630
parts of the system to dig through

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,520
things right it's not the best it's not

00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,170
the worst but it provides some sort of

00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,550
framework for you to have common

00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,110
language and teachings with people right

00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:19,510
if your team doesn't know how to

00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,070
troubleshoot right get your ops team

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,270
together and sort of figure out if you

00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,300
can put words around it what does it

00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:27,880
mean to troubleshoot your stack when it

00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,830
fails what do you care about and show

00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,100
these things to your developers so that

00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:34,810
not only can they see the data they can

00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,080
see how things are happening but when

00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:40,330
they touch it the data changes that's

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,130
empowering makes them feel good that's

00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,390
what you want right they're the

00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:49,360
consumers of this tool to mentally

00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:50,980
unless you're also a developer right you

00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,730
also have to build out an overview of

00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:57,310
the system even if it's ugly horrible

00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:59,350
rudimentary but you got to understand

00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,390
how the data is flowing you know like I

00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:04,470
said at the time I was two months into

00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,970
the job I was still trying to figure out

00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,950
you know who walls in the company let

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,940
alone what the system is doing to you

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,080
know are hundreds of thousands of

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,870
subscribers and it took about half a day

00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,610
to kind of corral people to you know put

00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,680
up a straw man here's where I think data

00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:22,540
is flowing from the front end through

00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,760
the middle tier back to the back end and

00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,870
and back around because these are the

00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,010
choke points you want to figure out

00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,390
right at each of these chokepoints

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,330
what's happening what's happening what's

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:33,850
happening and having this data flow

00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:37,660
gives you common language now to talk to

00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:39,550
other people right many people on your

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,160
team are only going to have visibility

00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,710
or scope into very narrow parts of their

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,380
stack whether it's one or two features

00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,630
or three or four features very few folks

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,010
have the complete picture and unless you

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,020
have the complete picture it's hard to

00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:55,090
figure out where I'm actually going to

00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,550
put instrumentation monitoring so do

00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,260
yourself a favor make yourself a data

00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,060
flows if you don't have them work on

00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,470
them collaborate on them because those

00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,710
will give you the touch points here's

00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:08,500
where you care about measuring right for

00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,180
us the load balancer engine X the

00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,640
application itself which had multiple

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,740
pieces the authentication pipeline as

00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,150
well as our applications that sort of

00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,920
support it web task do is our function

00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,320
as a service which we abstracted from

00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,630
our core code and bcrypt is a service

00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,550
alright so we actually have a side b

00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,070
crib service that does hashing for us

00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,830
each of these handoffs take time cost

00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,020
right and then obviously there is a

00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,250
database in there some days got to go

00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,810
somewhere each of these are potential

00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,600
places where you have to put some

00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,160
instrumentations in monitoring and take

00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,920
your baseline measurement right agree on

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,780
your common tests don't spin time bike

00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,820
shading here on ideal baselines just

00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,680
throw a stick in the mud and start

00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,660
measuring cardinal point zero cardinal

00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,380
point zero this is it we're going to go

00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:59,110
upwards from here not some imaginary put

00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,330
here right and here could be your

00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:03,670
baseline of 500 requests per second here

00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:07,920
could be you know a normal you know CPU

00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,920
analysis figure out what you're here is

00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:13,540
isolate each component and test

00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,030
individually so here's an example for us

00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,310
right like cliffs usually denote some

00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,170
sort of bottleneck right some sort of

00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:25,240
top in that a system can handle whether

00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:27,010
it's IO whether its CPU whatever in our

00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,330
system they sort of you know prop

00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:30,550
themselves up these look like beautiful

00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:33,610
cliffs here there's something going on

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:35,290
in each of our subsystems right so you

00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,000
can sort of go backwards if you know the

00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,410
data flow and you see it in multiple

00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,560
places where you have to go to the

00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,730
farthest part up right if you only see

00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,990
it in one or two places well then you

00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,000
can start to eliminate parts of your

00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:50,350
stack this restart to leverage your data

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,270
flow then obviously you gotta fix and

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,650
repair stuff so here's here's what

00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,630
actually happened at the ethereal case

00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:01,840
right here's how we want database was

00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:07,350
having some problems and we found out

00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:10,570
that was basically and and

00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:12,760
the end Matt mentioned sort of only

00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:15,160
optimizes to put documents in memory if

00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,140
they're constantly being used right in

00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,490
our case we're only using about twenty

00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,380
thirty percent of the whole dataset and

00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,630
that would stay in memory in cash and

00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,890
then most of the rest of the data set

00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:26,140
would be flushed even

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,940
no the system itself had more ram than

00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,010
the entire size of the data set we could

00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,869
have just hot loaded into ram and in

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:34,569
fact we even try to a couple times and

00:50:31,869 --> 00:50:35,710
which is dump it no I'm good we're good

00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:38,799
with that it didn't get accessed within

00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:40,750
n cycles so get out so we ended up

00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:42,849
moving a wire tiger which is a new

00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,589
storage engine in the 3-series and it's

00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:48,940
got a little cool knob and the knob says

00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:51,970
put more in RAM we turned it up and that

00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,940
turned out a 3x increase in requests per

00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:59,500
second that's awesome right that's a lot

00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:01,779
I I lead with the infrastructure piece

00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,750
because this is where the blame usually

00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:05,980
starts right and that's okay right what

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,529
you're trying to do is not necessarily

00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:11,380
defend your area you're trying to prove

00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:13,210
or disprove hypotheses in this case we

00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,640
did find that the d'mongo layer actually

00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:18,190
caused problems well great let's remove

00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:22,720
it as a variable and see what happens we

00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:24,460
got 3x now what we're not at 10x so

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,109
something obviously else is missing and

00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,089
then you can have conversations people

00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:29,890
we've done infrastructure tuning now

00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:31,569
we've done CPU tuning we've done

00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,799
whatever because you know a developer

00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:35,289
doesn't want to hear that their app is

00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:37,029
slow they don't right but at some point

00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:39,490
you need to be able to show them not

00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:40,900
only with data but also with actions on

00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,869
your part to show here's how I'm keeping

00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,690
my house clean right cool so we got

00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:48,519
 we also found in the web task

00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:51,609
layer the handoff that was happening

00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:53,710
there did not handle HTTP keep alives at

00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:56,319
all which means every connection that

00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:58,539
was going to it doing a full tear setup

00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,000
and teardown that's a lot right that's a

00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:03,009
lot of energy and so after some

00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,400
refactoring of a couple days the web

00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:08,890
task layer ended up going to 11,000

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,200
requests per second right that was after

00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,299
like finding that that we had a

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,559
purposeful bottleneck at the web task

00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:17,430
later we were able to isolate it to

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,769
there and go hey man what can you do and

00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,730
he went and looked at it and found this

00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,859
eleven thousand requests per second now

00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,839
this is not the full stack but this is a

00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:27,670
piece of the stack now that is no longer

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,660
encumbered by our top end of ten

00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:33,509
thousand which is where we want to be

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:33,509
good this is now no longer variable to

00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,850
and the last bit we found a slow running

00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,380
method in our authentication code this

00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:43,090
is sort of our God method if you will

00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,010
write every company sort of has one of

00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,390
these when they get started it's where

00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:47,440
everybody puts everything until they

00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:51,040
figure out they don't need it anymore

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,620
well we got to that point and we try to

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,440
do some refactoring mikado style hey

00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:58,360
we're going to try some things and after

00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,060
about two days they basically declared

00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,330
tire fire this is this is not fixable in

00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,650
our timeline but with you know

00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,890
experience that we've had over the past

00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:11,200
two years we now know what our customers

00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:12,850
actually expect from this end point all

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,650
right we have innate knowledge about how

00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:16,780
it's consumed and how our customer is

00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,190
going to consume it so let's refactor so

00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,360
they spend another two days working on

00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,090
actually rewriting that piece

00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,980
specifically for you know the new method

00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:27,160
that was being called and got rid of a

00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,380
lot of legacy code and then helped out

00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,410
tremendously and then obviously find

00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:35,110
memory leaks everywhere these are great

00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:37,240
right these are easy wins where you see

00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:40,180
memory exhaustion just go figure out why

00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,300
right there's plenty of ways to dig into

00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:44,620
that and so we started with five

00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,770
thousand requests per second and after

00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:50,560
all of this work we had something there

00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,240
like 10 and a half thousand requests per

00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,220
second we're able to celebrate with the

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:57,160
raptor jesus i don't care who you are

00:53:54,220 --> 00:54:02,020
that is awesome factor of ten and two

00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:04,180
weeks it's an atypical story but it's

00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,830
possible right that's the point I'm

00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:08,080
trying to make is that you're not always

00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,400
going to have a circumstance where you

00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:12,580
know two weeks of time is going to come

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,800
drop into your lap but you got to be

00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:17,620
prepared you got to be ready you got an

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,060
instrument early often you got to kind

00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,920
of figure out what you need to measure

00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,290
if you don't know what to measure blast

00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:28,410
blast radius right always get more and

00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:32,710
then narrow down align your incentives I

00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:35,410
like sleep you like sleep I like money

00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,910
you like money I like there's tons of

00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:38,710
communication mechanisms that can be

00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:40,120
used here figure out the incentives that

00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,680
the team that you're working on the boss

00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,780
is that you're working with what do they

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:47,710
care about use those things align your

00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:51,400
incentives you got to jump in don't

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:56,270
block don't hesitate do it get in it

00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,920
listen you have to the team that you're

00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:59,180
working with they're going to make or

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,040
break this is you're not building this

00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,620
tool for you you're building it for them

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:09,020
so what do they have to say why do they

00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:12,830
hate it or love it listen and the call

00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:14,480
to arms to people in this room right is

00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:16,880
to leave things better than you found it

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,470
right most of the people all of you are

00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,850
here because you're involved in

00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:21,170
monitoring your learning more about

00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,460
monitoring you're trying to do these

00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,690
types of things or you're doing these

00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,840
types of things in your organization

00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:30,050
right leave things better than you found

00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,910
it because the person that's going to

00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:34,340
come after you will either curse your

00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,290
name or praise your name and you know

00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,150
I'd like them to say I'm glad that

00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,830
someone so left instrumentation and

00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:42,170
monitoring it's really made my job

00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,000
better because then I'll want to go work

00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,860
there I want to attract people that want

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,620
to work there alright leave things

00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:51,620
better than you found it a quick special

00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:54,800
thanks this is the team that helped put

00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,990
it together r0 Jose Leo Tomac step

00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,330
ascend Reno and wallowski they spend a

00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,890
lot of time with us in the team kind of

00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:02,660
actually working through application

00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:05,630
performance right as we help them with

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:07,280
the infrastructure piece so that's it

00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:09,470
for me thank you very much I'm Jay

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,540
Fryman everywhere on the internet you

00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,970
can also email me if that your thing but

00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:19,190
I appreciate your time

00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:21,770
[Applause]

00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:24,500
tried your questions we got time just in

00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:26,210
time but we one or two yeah all the

00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,599
questions I actually took a whole hour

00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:34,700
that surprised me I'm sorry what

00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:36,319
questions okay just one at one point in

00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,240
your presentation you talk about that

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,910
you have to speak with the people and

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,099
tell them we need to do this and doesn't

00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:45,920
this and sometimes you have to tell them

00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:47,450
the things that they don't like yeah

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,819
especially when you're telling them

00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:51,530
maybe it's your performance of your

00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,880
application which is not so good or

00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,490
maybe we need to do this some other

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,940
things right um how do you tell people

00:56:55,490 --> 00:57:00,950
which we you want to involve that they

00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:03,410
actually have to do something but it

00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,240
don't like it's a difficult part of

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,920
monitoring and increasing performance

00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:10,640
from applications yeah good question so

00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,410
somebody's going to come to you and you

00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,990
have to tell them an unnecessary truth

00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:18,589
for them that their app is non ideal for

00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:21,470
the case that's going on right I'm big

00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:22,910
fan of data right it's sort of like the

00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,380
concept of this if you're at the point

00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,760
where you don't have instrumentation and

00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:27,650
you have these discussions there's not

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,750
really much you can do other than try to

00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:31,040
make really persuasive arguments and if

00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,230
you're going toe-to-toe with a developer

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,970
who wrote that application you promise

00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,589
you you're probably going to lose unless

00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:38,030
you're the SRA maintaining it in which

00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,680
case you might actually have an edge on

00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:42,349
that person but more times than not you

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:45,740
don't right so you know I sort of kind

00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:49,240
of drive toward there are a couple ways

00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:52,940
to approach it I've had two gorillas

00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:55,220
attack inflating instrumentation before

00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,560
where you don't have buy-in and and what

00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,270
that usually means is sort of like skunk

00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:02,089
works putting up some instrumentation or

00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,800
you can then say all right I know you

00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:05,569
don't want to hear this but check this

00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,579
out and now you're not having a

00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:09,140
conversation about them or their app

00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:10,910
you're showing them data and you can

00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:13,640
have conversations aligned with the data

00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:14,869
and so maybe you do like our d tool or

00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,280
something else they can give you some

00:58:14,869 --> 00:58:19,339
amount of like something's going on here

00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,810
I don't know what it is and if that you

00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:22,609
know should give you some amount of like

00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:24,079
ability to go have conversations with

00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:25,910
other leaders and then that's we start

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,980
to align incentives like I recognize

00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:30,380
that you know if we could release faster

00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:31,880
or if we had more performant we could

00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,500
get more requests which

00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,289
turns into more money like in you know

00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,089
in appeal to people's greed in a sense

00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:40,039
because your greed is I want to sleep

00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:43,539
their greed is I want money align the

00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:46,369
incentives so keep it data focused

00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:48,140
gorilla where you can if you have to but

00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:52,160
always try to point to data so it's not

00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:56,059
personal one more I'm actually in that

00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,759
point I want to measure more I eat LOX

00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:01,549
for example i'm working for government

00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:04,910
and we're pretty slow and implementing

00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:07,819
implementing new things so we just

00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:10,220
talking and talking a whole time i think

00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:11,660
i will actually do this implement

00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,059
something show them something and tell

00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:16,160
them a year with this we can make some

00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:17,750
improvements ya know we have to decide

00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,339
to use it you have to break the gridlock

00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:25,490
somehow i i i believe that meetings are

00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:27,759
an excuse to defer in truth like i'm not

00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:30,349
a fan of meetings right go and do stuff

00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:32,000
and sometimes that means you know going

00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:33,589
above and beyond and getting the data to

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,630
have that conversation that gets you out

00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:36,950
of that roadblock right so you know have

00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,950
meetings as you need to but you know

00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:41,210
figure out how how you can overcome

00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:44,509
there's a one over here or do we got

00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:48,559
time are we out more one more real short

00:59:44,509 --> 00:59:51,079
i will also be sharing my gin it's a

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,700
nice event for my birthday so if you

00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:56,210
want to come and talk more about this i

00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:58,009
definitely will be there so a buying

00:59:56,210 --> 01:00:00,140
from the top have you had any

00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:02,750
spectacular failure or maybe if not then

01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:04,250
what was the hardest case for you yeah i

01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:07,519
have had spectacular failures that's a

01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:10,039
good question the good news is that

01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:12,829
things that you're usually good at you

01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:15,740
fail that many many times right and in

01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:21,200
this case and i'll give an example

01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:26,750
without naming names but I had a I had a

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:28,819
CEO who was really you know I guess

01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,140
wanted to do instrumentation he wanted

01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:32,359
to know how his app is working i want to

01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:34,430
know how it worked and the CTO did not

01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:36,829
because you know wasn't the most

01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,710
important feature whatnot and i probably

01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:41,240
spent weeks and weeks trying to make the

01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:45,319
argument that hey this is important this

01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,619
is important and i failed we never got

01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:47,119
in

01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:49,039
imitation and monitoring into that tool

01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,039
and I'm still not happy about it to this

01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:55,220
day and I think it was because you know

01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:57,289
fundamentally the Maslow's hierarchy of

01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,480
Nina's applies a DevOps that's sort of

01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:00,799
like that's the focal point of the

01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,990
conversation when you're having business

01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:06,529
leader conversations because you know

01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:09,109
besides money there's not a real clear

01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:12,440
path to how to do this stuff yet and if

01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:13,970
you sort of outline to them the levels

01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,130
of maturity and show them that what

01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,450
they're striving for is up here when

01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,700
they haven't solved problems down here

01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:21,289
you know these graphics and things like

01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,359
this make impact to business leaders

01:01:21,289 --> 01:01:24,890
because they only have 23 minutes to

01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,910
give a crap about whatever it is that

01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,099
you're talking about before they got to

01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:31,700
go to the next thing so you know have

01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:33,650
sort of like ways to share why

01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,299
monitoring comes at this point and this

01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,009
is this right here this graphic has been

01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:39,769
the most powerful for me after that

01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:41,380
point so I highly recommend it alright

01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:43,450
that's it for me thank you again

01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:47,749
appreciate it

01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,749
