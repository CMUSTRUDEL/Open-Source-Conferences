Title: OSMC 2016 | Metrics are for chumps (EN) by James Fryman
Publication date: 2016-12-12
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	At a conference like OSMC, it’s bewildering to hear that companies do not have ways to measure how their systems are performing. Yet, this is the norm. In our current economic climate, the argument to spend time instrumenting code and tooling seems counter-productive, and is often assigned the same priority that is placed on documentation (last, if at all). A vast number of reasons exist for why companies are *not* leveraging instrumentation, and inertia and lack of understanding only perpetuates this problem. In this talk, we will not spend time talking about an ideal infrastructure. Rather, we’ll spend time talking about how and why metrics implementations fail in the first place, and discuss some ways that you can overcome and find ultimate harmony within IT.
