Title: OSMC 2016 | Monitor your Infrastructure with Elastic Beats (EN) by Monica Sarbu
Publication date: 2016-12-13
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The Beats are a friendly army of lightweight agents that, installed on your servers, capture operational data and ship it to Elasticsearch for analysis. They collect the logs from your servers, get system statistics like CPU, memory, disk usage, gather metrics by interrogating periodically external systems like MySQL, Docker, Zookeeper and give you visibility into your network by sniffing the traffic exchanged between your servers.
This talk shows how to combine the Beats with Elasticsearch and Kibana in one complete open source monitoring solution that helps you monitor and troubleshoot your distributed infrastructure.
