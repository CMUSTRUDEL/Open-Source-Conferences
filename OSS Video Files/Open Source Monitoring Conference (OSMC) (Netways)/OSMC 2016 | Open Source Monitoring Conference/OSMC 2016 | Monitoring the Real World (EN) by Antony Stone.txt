Description: 
	We all know about monitoring computer systems and networks, but what about the real world? This talk will discuss monitoring your bank account, fish tank, solar power installation, prices on eBay, and more. Monitoring is not just for computers - it's for anything that can be measured. For me, "monitoring" means two things - continuous measurement (combined with historical graphing to show trends), and alert / alarm thresholds, to trigger a response when some measurement reaches a pre-set limit.  This response might be an email or an SMS to a person, or it could be an automated reaction having some real effect - purchasing an item on eBay or Amazon, adjusting a setting on your fish tank, or switching power feeds on your solar generator. In this presentation we'll look at some of the ways you can get real-world data into a monitoring system such as Icinga, with scripts to act on the alert thresholds, and I'll show some examples of what can be monitored beyond the standard filesystem usage and network bandwidth we're all used to seeing.
