Title: OSMC 2016 | Monitoring the Real World (EN) by Antony Stone
Publication date: 2016-12-12
Playlist: OSMC 2016 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	We all know about monitoring computer systems and networks, but what about the real world? This talk will discuss monitoring your bank account, fish tank, solar power installation, prices on eBay, and more. Monitoring is not just for computers - it's for anything that can be measured. For me, "monitoring" means two things - continuous measurement (combined with historical graphing to show trends), and alert / alarm thresholds, to trigger a response when some measurement reaches a pre-set limit.  This response might be an email or an SMS to a person, or it could be an automated reaction having some real effect - purchasing an item on eBay or Amazon, adjusting a setting on your fish tank, or switching power feeds on your solar generator. In this presentation we'll look at some of the ways you can get real-world data into a monitoring system such as Icinga, with scripts to act on the alert thresholds, and I'll show some examples of what can be monitored beyond the standard filesystem usage and network bandwidth we're all used to seeing.

alright so now we will listen to Antonia

00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,350
stone telling us something about

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,730
monitoring the real world enjoy I'm

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,290
going to do this the best I can we're

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,570
going to lose the right hand part of the

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,079
screen that I can't seem to adjust that

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,840
I'm sorry ok so I'm going to talk about

00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,640
monitoring the real world just make sure

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,250
we're all in the same page to begin with

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,840
I want to define what i mean by

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,399
monitoring I don't think that's going to

00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,750
be anything to unusual but I want to

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,790
make sure that we've got the same

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,000
definitions and also what do I mean by

00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:45,309
the real world monitoring for me

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,579
consists of three essential items a few

00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:50,379
health and nice add-ons as well but

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,730
you've got to be measuring something if

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:52,840
you're not measuring something well

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,699
you're not talking about anything

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,230
definite you've got to have some metrics

00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:00,070
you've got to have some information to

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:02,230
work on hard data i also like very much

00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,999
to have archiving a historical record of

00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,210
what those missions were not just what's

00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,980
the value now but what's been happening

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,260
in the past how does it vary from what

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,120
we've seen before it's not essential but

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,430
for me it makes a big difference and

00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,300
i'll i'll show you that as we go through

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:20,650
some of the examples here monitoring

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,420
also means more than measuring you've

00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,340
got to compare against some thresholds

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,060
because you've got to decide is this

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,040
okay is this a problem am i concerned

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,400
about this you've got how some measure

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,310
of is this normal usage is this normal

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,950
performance or is this getting critical

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,690
is this something that needs attention

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,670
and then finally monitoring itself needs

00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,340
to have some form of alerting or

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,960
response it's all very well doing

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,430
measuring and comparing but if you don't

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
tell somebody about a problem they're

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,090
not going to react and you've just got a

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,950
historical record of yeah something went

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,930
wrong and you can see that in the

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,970
standard log files and so on so for me

00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,710
those are the three essential parts of a

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,750
monitoring system you've got to measure

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,850
some hard data compare it against some

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,730
thresholds and that somebody know or

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,920
react in some way when it goes beyond

00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,539
what those thresholds it could be an

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,099
automated response doesn't have to

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,849
involve a person but we know that it

00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:18,550
often does so what am I talking about

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,340
with the real world and we're all used

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,140
to monitoring networks and computers and

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,560
so on and that's the standard use of

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,420
icing

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,819
you're in nagios and zabbix and opennms

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,110
and everything else but I'm not going to

00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,630
be talking about that so I'm not talking

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,250
about disk usage process counts number

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,860
of telephones connected network

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,870
bandwidth stuff like that that's all

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,510
very important but it's not the subject

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,870
of today's talk I'm more interested in

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,849
things like what's the weather what sort

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,160
of power production or power consumption

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:51,130
are we experiencing what's my what the

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,959
healthy state of my fish tank or how the

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,390
bees getting on in hive outside stuff

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,310
like that those are some just some

00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,019
examples I've done of the sorts of

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,019
things in the real world that we can

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:05,489
monitor still have any interest in and

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,489
want to have a response in a reaction to

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,299
so if you don't measure something then

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,250
there's no information and without

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:18,310
archiving there's no history or trends

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,170
and if you don't compare things it's

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,750
just a dumb recorder and you're

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,489
gathering data but you're not putting

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,890
any interpretation on it you're not

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,900
putting any significance on what is the

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,670
value at the moment and if you don't

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,739
respond you may as well not bother doing

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,650
the monitoring because you're not

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,299
actually reacting to the situation you

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,280
see at the time you'll just be able to

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,130
look historically at yeah something

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,170
happened and it can be interesting but

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,739
it's not really what we want in terms of

00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,489
keeping things going and being able to

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,709
respond to something when it's

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,170
appropriate to do so and you may only

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,180
have a limited time frame in which to

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,549
perform a response no I'll show you some

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:02,079
examples as we go through some of the

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,660
examples that i'm going to show here do

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,280
interact with other people's systems so

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,739
i just want to put a cautionary

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,660
disclaimer here some of the measurements

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,090
presented here do collect data from

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,190
other organizations such as eBay or

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,320
Amazon or various banks and so on and

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,810
please note that some of them do have

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,729
acceptable use conditions policies which

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,110
indicate how you may or may not interact

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,580
with them so if you do choose to

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,410
implement some of the things that I'm

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,940
presenting here do bear in mind that

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,220
you're responsible for making sure that

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,620
you are within their acceptable use

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,249
policy what they will do if you go

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,599
beyond that is up to them

00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:41,659
you should be able to find that on each

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,729
of their websites and so on Alex I'll

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:45,799
discuss a specific example a bit later

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,569
on when i get to one of them where i

00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:49,519
found out oh they do have an acceptable

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,979
use policy and are not within it I

00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,469
wasn't rear of that beforehand but it

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:58,909
soon became apparent and I adjusted

00:04:54,469 --> 00:05:02,119
things so that it works better now so on

00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:04,069
to some real world examples lots of

00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:06,829
people use solar power generation these

00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:09,409
days either in industrial installations

00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:11,689
for powering buildings and data centers

00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,029
and so on and or just domestic

00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:17,149
installations where you want to use the

00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:18,829
spare space on your roof and you can

00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:21,289
actually sell the electricity back to

00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:22,999
the electricity generating companies I

00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:24,739
must admit I'm not quite sure how the

00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:26,209
economics of this work out because you

00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:28,549
often find at the price you can sell it

00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:30,829
to the mat is higher than what they

00:05:28,549 --> 00:05:34,099
charge you for getting electricity from

00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:36,049
them under normal conditions so it's

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,629
obviously an incentive of some sort to

00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:42,079
get this kick-started and going but it's

00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:45,860
as an interesting economic situation so

00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,919
I've got a friend who lives I guess

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,659
about 150 kilometers north of here and

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,479
he decided some years ago about 10 years

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,360
ago or so to implement a solar power

00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:00,289
installation on his roof that's an

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,389
example of one of his panels I don't

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,699
know quite how many panels he's got now

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,499
but these are some of the images that he

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:10,610
sent off the installation that he's got

00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:12,739
and he works as an instrumentation

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,739
engineer in the first place so he's got

00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:17,569
an interest in measurements and the sort

00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:20,059
of equipment that is used in industrial

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,159
situations for measuring and monitoring

00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:24,919
power consumption power distribution

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:26,479
power production and as well as quite a

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:31,789
number of environmental factors that

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,799
comes into it as well so and he's got an

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:36,199
ambient light sensor which is this one

00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:38,059
over here that is simply in order to

00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,619
record what sort of ambient light is

00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:41,529
there quite independently of whatever

00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:43,489
the solar panel is capable of generating

00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:45,499
sorry about the caption here but this

00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,239
one is a rain sensor you're not missing

00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:49,920
much of the picture it looks a bit like

00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:52,020
a small upside down bucket

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,270
and funnel inside it which collects rain

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,950
and then gives him a measure of what has

00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,520
been the rain fall within a certain

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:03,510
period of time because his interest in

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,970
an job indeed is in instrumentation and

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,820
collecting data from various pieces of

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,470
equipment he's added quite a number of

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,060
different sensors to the system around

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,790
the house and he not only measures the

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,100
solar power generation that his setup is

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,840
creating but he's also measuring several

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,680
areas of temperature both indoors and

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,250
outdoors and so up in the loft the roof

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,540
space of his building down in the cellar

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,140
externally at a couple of different

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,300
heights in beiges humidity as well which

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,190
is quite important for the well being of

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,190
some of the electronics that is got

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,180
installed in the cellar for example

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,690
ambient air pressure is an interesting

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,730
weather indicator and he also measures

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,930
his household power consumption now

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,180
that's not something that everybody

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,860
would find easy to do because the power

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,720
companies don't generally like you

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,100
connecting anything in at the point

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,500
where the power comes into the house

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,120
before it gets drifts distributed but if

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,700
you know how to connect that up and

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,880
you've got access to the appropriate

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:09,210
equipment you can measure how much power

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,950
is the entire house using obviously you

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,850
can also implement various little bits

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,710
of equipment which would monitor the

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,240
consumption of individual devices or

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,750
maybe individual rooms depending on the

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,400
wiring we've got somehow or other he's

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,440
also managed to include gas consumption

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,790
and water usage and as I say he's got

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,170
the rain gauge so it's got quite a lot

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,180
of instrumentation around the place

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:34,110
measuring various aspects of what the

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,080
house is up to this is what and one of

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,490
his cupboards looks like he's got a

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,100
section on power supplies and

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:46,740
distribution for the main supply from

00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,080
the power company his solar generation

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,670
part of it and also a battery backup so

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,010
the entire instrumentation side

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,740
continues working even if he has a power

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,490
failure and it's not very sunny there's

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,270
a similarly complicated piece of

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,550
equipment on the other side is about

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,779
that wide so same size as that and that

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,029
is the into

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,509
this is a main controller board which

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:12,300
collects all of the data from various

00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:14,879
items of telemetry that's got around the

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,499
house and does the data processing in

00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,519
the logging stores the information and

00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:24,240
then present it available to him as a an

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,540
interface such as this yeah we can see

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,689
pretty much all of that there so it's

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,120
got various pieces of data down the side

00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:35,639
to do with how much solar power is being

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,499
generated what power usage he's got what

00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:43,470
gas usage water temperatures outsider to

00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:47,759
up on his roof outside down near the

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,699
ground air pressure and so on and then

00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:54,269
the typical graphs of what those have

00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:56,040
been doing over the past 24 hours he

00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:59,370
also chose by the way to stick a camera

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,920
on his roof so it just happens to look

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,420
out over the town not at anything in

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
particular but it gives a good

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,949
indication of the prevailing weather

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,660
conditions he uses this mainly for

00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:15,089
monitoring in terms of previous

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,100
performance and checking when does he

00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,139
deny most electricity when is he

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,399
consuming most electricity how could he

00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,949
improve the performance of this

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,319
installation and there's not a great

00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:27,420
deal of alerting in this apart from

00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:30,870
things like humidity or water level in

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,170
case there's a leak around the place and

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,850
if the seller gets either too humid or

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:41,029
flooded and there's a concern about

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:48,629
their electronics there so and these

00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:51,179
sorry these devices here yeah the these

00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:54,779
are mounted down in the cellar near to

00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:58,470
the power distribution network for the

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,240
house in general so he uses that just

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,879
for being alerted in case there is a

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,660
problem with the condition of the

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,429
electronics so obviously he's gone to

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,029
quite an extent here based on the

00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:14,040
equipment he's got available at work and

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:17,160
his knowledge of doing that but it's a

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,449
good indication of how you can extend

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,790
measurements of all sorts of kinds too

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:23,259
what is rapidly becoming quite a common

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,299
installation in and domestic environment

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:32,350
as well as an industrial one moving on

00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,819
to a completely different topic I quite

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,079
like keeping a track of my bank account

00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:39,549
we have a question I would prefer the

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,220
questions at the end thanks is easy with

00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:44,679
the microphone apart from anything else

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,379
and I quite like monitoring my bank

00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,350
account and however I don't have to log

00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:54,089
in every day lots of banks have online

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:57,129
banking systems these days so you can

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,749
log-in do transactions and so on these

00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,669
happen to be three of the ones that I

00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,589
use I have a business account with

00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:04,389
santander I have a personal account in

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,649
England with the bank of scotland and a

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,139
personal account in germany with

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:11,169
deutsche bank so i thought how

00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:13,269
complicated can it be to write a script

00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,339
to log in i'm using appropriate

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:16,949
credentials find the bit that says this

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,569
is your current balance and then

00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:21,939
represent it some way and it turns out

00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:23,889
not very difficult at all i don't intend

00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,360
to go through this in detail but i just

00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:31,059
wanted to give you an indication that

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,399
written in bash this is a summary of how

00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,499
straightforward it is to get the

00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,629
information this one is Deutsche Bank so

00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:40,029
on the first line you see there is a URL

00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:42,399
for where to log in there's a couple of

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:46,509
paths to files that they use for the

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,249
login process I've written it so that it

00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:49,839
can either do through the English

00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:52,139
language interface or the German

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,549
language interface they do provide both

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,679
and then I've simply got a couple of W

00:12:54,549 --> 00:13:01,239
get commands which use cookies from the

00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:06,399
previous login session cookies are used

00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:09,100
by deutsche bank so it can maintain the

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,419
identity from the login process to fetch

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,720
my balance and then depending on whether

00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:19,209
it got the right answer from the second

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,709
double you get the maybe a third one in

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,129
order to actually find out what the

00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:26,410
balance is and then finally you simply

00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:29,709
do a search for that magic phrase

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,000
English or German a few bits of text

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,590
processing in order to pick out

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,170
right field and there you have the

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,470
balance right at the end you may

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:42,280
recognize that is a 30 standard

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:48,520
performance data output to icinga or

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:50,710
nagios and here is a check that I've

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,240
written this one is I singer 1 i'll have

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,810
some examples from our singer too for a

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,320
couple of them later so there's a check

00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,780
command called check Georgia bank and

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:07,330
I'd check it every 60 minutes and if

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,590
there's a problem why not actually that

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,800
makes a lot more sense with English

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,450
banks German banks and typically only do

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,490
transactions overnight and they take a

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,050
long time three days often too actually

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,740
renault tease that you've been sent some

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:22,600
money with english banks if i make a

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,550
transaction from sandton dare to bank of

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,300
scotland by the time i can log into bank

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,140
of scotland is there and i considered so

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,970
transactions happened throughout the day

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,320
and they really do happen pretty much

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,360
the moment somebody has sent the money

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,440
so yeah checking your bank balance once

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,690
an hour is not ridiculous after all and

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:53,050
that's the sort of output do you get so

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:55,030
that is that that is one year and I i

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,220
set a warning threshold of a thousand

00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,560
euros and a critical threshold of two

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,110
hundred simply because I quite like to

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,580
know is there any risk that my rent is

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,970
not going to be paid that's about a

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,460
thousand euros a month and I I don't

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,170
really want to go overdrawn so if it

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,310
gets below 200 I might need to try and

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,890
get some money from somewhere else in

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,540
hurry so that's why I said those alarm

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,700
thresholds and it really just send me

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,500
emails to tell me and your bank balance

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:26,410
is getting critically low in case you

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,410
hadn't noticed once you've got some

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,060
money you might want to spend it and

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:35,170
there's plenty of interesting things on

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:38,800
Amazon so for example I might decide

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:43,540
that I fancy a fluffy penguin and priced

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,800
at 49 heroes 95 well and it's um it's

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,750
only 30 centimeters one

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,200
foot high so that seems quite expensive

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,510
for a pen you know that sighs I think so

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,730
how about tracking the price of things

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,290
on amazon and getting alerts into me

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,140
when the prices come down to a level

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,910
that I am happy with I don't know how

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,740
many people have looked at items on

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,420
amazon and then looked at them again a

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,180
day or a week or a month later and

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,860
realized the price has changed I wonder

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,250
how much it might how much more it might

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,040
change and so on prices iams and really

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:19,450
do change quite remarkably and quite

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,190
quickly so here again is a script that

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,959
I've written once again with the

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,750
performance data at the bottom and that

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,660
will fetch the price on the damn of an

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,550
Amazon item it does not log in as me so

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,399
this is nothing specific to me as a user

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:37,350
this will simply fetch the the price of

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:42,519
an item on amazon given the product ID

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:45,459
which if you look at an item I don't

00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,230
know no it's not actually on there if

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,820
you look a bit further down from the

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,750
product description you have what's

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:56,440
called an ASI n amazon something

00:16:52,750 --> 00:17:00,100
identity number I was something sounds

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,150
good enough starts with s failure could

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,439
be amazon standard identity number so

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,290
once you've found that out you simply

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,650
put that in to your I single object as

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:14,169
the thing that you want to monitor and

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,490
this will then go off and check the

00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:19,540
price for you here we have the

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,660
definition of it so this is the check

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,030
command which passes over the ASI n your

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,339
critical and warning levels I tend to

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,750
use this long the lines of the warning

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,790
level is something where if it's come

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,470
down that much I'm interested the

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,290
critical level is if it come down that

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,460
much I'm going to buy it so I want to

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,929
know the difference between has it

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,480
really come down enough that I'm going

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,770
to go for it or am I just going to be

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,559
interest and think well I might do

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:48,850
depending on how how much I need it at

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:52,300
the moment there's a service check for

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,460
applying the price to some item and this

00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,400
is a nice example of something I do

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,600
quite a lot with I singer i define a

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,549
service

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,160
and I apply it to any object which has

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,720
got the appropriate parameter defined so

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,090
if i have given something an object

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,610
which contains a variable called amazon

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,740
ASI n it automatic gets checked in this

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,600
way I don't have to define that check

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,960
for every individual object that I then

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,929
create and there is an example of an

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,260
object so I've put in the name of it

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,730
it's a set of books the check command is

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,650
dummy because there's no way of doing a

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,169
ping check on a book on Amazon so I

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,390
don't want I singer to tell me this

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:35,049
thing is down all the time and that's

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:38,559
the nose the prices down that it and

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:42,900
that is the identity number and what you

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:47,860
get is a service output of the price a

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,270
historical summary of that and as you

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:56,409
can see sometimes it's quite interesting

00:18:49,270 --> 00:19:00,789
that is a summary of this year so week

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:02,740
40 is around about September I think of

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,549
the price of that item is to set for

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,440
books that are available on Amazon and

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,780
you can see how the price fluctuates

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:16,169
between two standard levels but

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:20,380
occasionally goes even more extreme and

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:23,860
if you look in detail that is one

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,530
weekend so I believe I looked at that

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,539
weekend there might be no more but I

00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,179
think is that weekend there i went into

00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:34,260
more detail and that shows you how the

00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:36,640
price of an item can change on amazon

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,440
notice that these are hourly

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,990
measurements so friday morning it was 10

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,570
euros or 10 pounds 10 pounds i think

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,520
then it came down to five pounds he then

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:52,150
came down to two stayed there for an

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,039
hour went back up to 10 and this really

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,070
is what happens to some of the prices on

00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,480
amazon this is the point at which i

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:06,070
found out what their acceptable use

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:08,650
policy was because if you monitor the

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,070
price of anything just a single item on

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,340
amazon once per hour after a couple of

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,500
the

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,870
days they say hmm we're not very happy

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,289
about this and you get a little popup

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,909
message in the browser response saying

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:24,070
we need to prove that you are a person

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:25,779
and not a robot now of course this is a

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,110
robot so it doesn't respond so I ran out

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,110
of data

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,770
and they don't do anything beyond that

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,870
once you've locked in a few times and as

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,030
long as you do not carry on checking

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,130
things once per hour then it all comes

00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,570
back to normal what I have found is if

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,830
you check once a day that's all right

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:47,600
that's no problem but yeah once per hour

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,490
or even more frequently and they do

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,010
notice there are ways of doing that

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,500
perfectly legitimately you can get an

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,470
API key from amazon which means that

00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,470
you've got a perfectly legitimate

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,720
opportunity to check prices more often

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,340
but they only issue that once they've

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,830
got your identity and know who you are

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,080
and have an idea why you're doing it so

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,940
it is possible to do but even if you

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,179
don't have that API key you can still

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,890
check once a day for prices of things

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:19,610
here's another example of an object that

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,770
I was looking at that's a years tracking

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,620
of the price of an item and that was

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,929
particularly interesting so that is the

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,299
first four weeks of January and you can

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,970
see that the price was 15 pounds came

00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:36,290
down to about eight pounds and was even

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:38,120
below five for several days and

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,590
obviously if you're interested in buying

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,200
things but you're not too bothered about

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,030
when it's good to have a check that will

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,429
tell you the price is gradually come

00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:52,940
down now is the time to get it so moving

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:55,010
on from banks or Amazon and so on let's

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,309
have a look at some animals and I'll

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,910
start small and bees plenty people keep

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,590
bees and they live in hives out in the

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,280
middle of nowhere but you want to know

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:10,730
how they're getting on that's an example

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,290
of some bees so you have several

00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,380
thousand of these living in a wooden

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:16,970
hive and you've got a an electronics

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,150
bench you might add some instrumentation

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,970
to them there's quite a few things that

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,880
are worth measuring about bees firstly

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,679
what's the temperature inside their hive

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,970
I don't know if anybody here is familiar

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,950
with beehives but they're basically

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,750
wooden boxes with a bit of ventilation

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,460
but that's it there's no artificial

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,490
heating they just live out in the open

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,650
air but the bees themselves maintain the

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,050
temperature remarkably constantly it

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,530
turns out and is good indication of how

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,940
happy they

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,480
are how well they're going on with

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,730
things and if you measure the sound

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,560
inside the hive how much noise of the

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,240
bees making what sort of noise are the

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,130
bees making that can give you an

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,560
exceedingly good indicator of are they

00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,110
about to split into two and one part of

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,510
the hive will swarm off and go and set

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,070
up a new home somewhere if that happens

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,350
you've probably lost half of your bees

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,880
and somebody might phone you up and say

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,310
can you come and collect some bees

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,470
please and if they're yours be very

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:14,090
happy but if you can predict that

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,500
they're going to swarm that means you

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,870
can split the hive yourself put them

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,010
into two separate wooden hives and carry

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,900
on working with them often the purpose

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,000
of keeping bees is you want to get honey

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,950
from them so if you weigh the hive and

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,950
simply put pressure sensors underneath

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,570
the feet you can have a good idea of

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,770
maybe how many bees there are inside the

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,720
hive but that only changed it over

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,160
long-term basis but how much honey if

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,930
they're generated what's actually inside

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,550
the hive and you can do that

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,230
non-invasively it means you don't have

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,760
to open the hive and disturb the bees

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,280
and have a look around at what they've

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,450
been doing so they're much happier like

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:52,760
that here we are again with the hive

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,450
with the lid off large number of bees

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,790
inside making this honeycomb with plenty

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,280
of honey in it on the top is a bit of

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,370
instrumentation that's based around an

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,520
Arduino board with at the moment Justin

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,710
temperatures answers that's a that gives

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,300
you an idea of the size of it the board

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,570
itself is about five centimeters long

00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:18,530
and and attached to that is a

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,760
temperature probe that's what the

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,060
temperature probe looks like it's

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,270
homemade but so there's a temperature

00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,750
sensor there cabling another sensor in

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,220
there more cabling and just off the end

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:35,330
of it unfortunately because of the

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,790
screen there's a third sensor and these

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,860
photographs and these sensors have been

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,720
provided to me by another couple of

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:46,870
friends who live near Cambridge in

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:50,630
England they keep these bees out in a

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,280
paddock field near to their home and Jen

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,840
because they're into electronics and

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,100
software and so on they've set up this

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,160
automatic monitoring for them

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,169
and the point is this is difficult

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,480
because beehives are generally not near

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:06,360
to a convenient main socket you can't

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,059
plug it in to keep an eye on how they're

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,710
getting on so because there's some

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,480
distance away you need to find a way of

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,559
transmitting this data wirelessly and

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,630
with very very low power and what these

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,740
people have done is they've used UK has

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:25,200
net has stands for high altitude society

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:29,309
and basically it's a group of people who

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,130
got together in order to provide

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,630
equipment very small electronics which

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,120
can be used for high-altitude weather

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,140
balloons and that sort of thing

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,750
equipment which you want to send up into

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,110
the atmosphere powered and lightweight

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,380
but able to send continuous data back to

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,539
a base station on earth in order to be

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,880
able to give a real-time indication of

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,950
what the conditions are you can't rely

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,299
on storing the data while you while the

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,159
thing is away and then recovering it

00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,690
later because you may not never recover

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,330
the thing you've got no idea where it'll

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,039
end up so it's got to be lightweight to

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,600
be able to travel on the balloon cheap

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,669
because you might not get it back and

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,150
low-power so that it can transmit

00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:12,480
something over a decent period of time

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:15,570
lot there what this society's come up

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,940
with is simple mesh network protocol so

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,950
it's based on each station being able to

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,690
see another station and data being

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,179
transmitted and relayed from one section

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,200
to another across the network and this

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,059
network covers Europe and several other

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,659
countries around the world depend on the

00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:35,400
number of people who are interested and

00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:38,490
you can get a cheap module less than 10

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,240
pounds on a license free radio frequency

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,440
so you can just implement it and send it

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,580
up into the atmosphere without any

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,440
concerns and it has a real a routing

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,809
Network so you don't have to be within

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,700
radio range of the double object that

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,230
you set up you don't have to have your

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,400
own base station if you don't need want

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:01,260
to you've also got connectivity to a web

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,000
address and that means that you can

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,610
recover information through a web

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,679
interface rather than again having to

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,720
have a radio interface to get this data

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,510
and this is the sort of the

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,870
they get out of it this data is from

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,250
this year week 9 through to week 13 so

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,450
that's something like march of this year

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:25,110
and these two graphs are of two levels

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:27,990
of sensors in the same beehive so d1 is

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,970
fairly low down in the Beehive d2 is

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,290
much higher up and it gives you an

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,950
indication you can see the general

00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:37,200
trends are similar but the variation the

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,760
sensor lowdown is quite a lot more as

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,740
cold air comes in through the

00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,020
ventilation by the time it reaches the

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,820
middle or year d 2 is the middle and d3

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,500
is the top by the time it reaches the

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,360
rich in the middle of the bee hive the

00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,250
bees have managed to regulate the

00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,100
temperature quite a lot more and as far

00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,850
less variation in that temperature over

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,410
quite some period of time and it's worth

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,270
commenting that in march in

00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,950
cambridgeshire and the ambient

00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,960
temperature is considerably below 10

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,280
degrees centigrade and so the bees are

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,930
maintaining the temperature in

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,870
themselves another hive which is

00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,240
actually much more populated for the

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,550
same period you can see has got a much

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,580
higher temperature in general and far

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,120
less variation this hive is near to the

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,260
other one but it has a far more mature

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,390
population of bees a far larger

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,250
population of bees and it shows you how

00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,990
good they are at maintaining their

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,510
temperature you can see virtually no

00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,930
daily rhythm there no daily cycle as it

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,950
gets cold night and warm in the day and

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,720
by monitoring this you've got a good

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,610
idea of how happy the bees are how

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,050
they're getting on and as I say by

00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,610
measuring the weight of the hive as well

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:47,340
you can get an indication of the honey

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,800
production without having to go out in

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,290
convene use you and without having to

00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,030
disturb the bees themselves which means

00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:59,670
that they are happier and do a better

00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:01,080
job some people kick tropical fish

00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,360
instead of bees you can get these

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,840
indoors so they're they're much more

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,180
straightforward from that point of view

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,210
tropical fish live in warm salt water

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,280
but the very sensitive their environment

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,490
there are various things which are of

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,880
concern to them and variation over quite

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:22,930
a narrow range can be significant be

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,670
important to them and they can be

00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,350
quite liable to diseases or even death

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,830
as a result of these things not being

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,180
right fish in a tank a far more

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,380
vulnerable to changes in their

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,520
environment when they're living in the

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,760
sea because it was a smaller water

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,490
volume and a small change in chemicals

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,560
in that water as proportionately a far

00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,450
greater effect there's no dilution of

00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,920
the fact that freshwater come in from

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,320
somewhere else and take away waste

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,270
materials and so on you also often have

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,040
a higher population density of fish in a

00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,280
tank than you would do in the open sea

00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,930
so again changes in the environment are

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,520
going to have an effect on a far larger

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,110
number of fish they can't swim off and

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,350
find a more pleasant environment for

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,510
themselves instead use usually have a

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,550
less diverse ecosphere as well you don't

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,780
have the other plants and animals which

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:13,510
are capable of dealing with the waste

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,640
materials so some enterprising

00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,510
organization has taken a standard

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:23,550
arduino board and produced a an arduino

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:25,780
shield for it called open aquarium and

00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:28,000
they produce a temperature sensor

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,520
there's just a couple of wires sticking

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,490
out on the end of that they've produced

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:37,990
a pH sensor and a conductivity sensor a

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,460
water level sensor which just sits near

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,280
the top of the tank and has a float in

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,900
it to check the level of the water and

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,510
when you've connected everything up

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:49,740
you've got these various sensors in a

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:54,460
tank that's a standard aquarium heater

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,900
that's a air pump for maintaining air

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,640
circulation throughout the water and

00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,140
then you've got this Arduino board up at

00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,040
the top doing all sorts of various

00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:05,260
instrumentation and again it's good to

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,330
be doing this on a continuous basis so

00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,550
that you've got a continuous measurement

00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,170
of the conditions in the tank if the

00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,580
nitrate levels for example which are a

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:14,410
representative of the waste products

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,720
produced by fish if those nitrate levels

00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:19,480
get too high you want to react fairly

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,750
quickly within 24 hours if you leave it

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,120
for 48 or 72 hours you will probably

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,550
have dead fish by then not all of them

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,560
but the more sensitive ones so you want

00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,870
to be able to react to things as quickly

00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,160
as possible traditionally the way of

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,810
monitoring things like that is with

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,519
chemical test kits where you take a

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,889
little sample of water out of the

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,749
tank put it into a container apply

00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:43,179
reagents and so on and then you get a

00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:45,459
color indication of what concentration

00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:47,859
you've got being able to do all of this

00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:50,169
electronically and continuously is a far

00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:51,489
more convenient solution and a far

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:53,709
better solution from the point of view

00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:57,549
of reacting as quickly as you can to

00:31:53,709 --> 00:32:00,339
keep the fish comfortable and happy of

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:03,459
course they've gone a bit further here

00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:07,239
is the standard baseboard they've also

00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:09,099
added on a wireless interface so that

00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:12,549
you can then connect this lot up to the

00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:15,070
network and monitor things from a web

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:17,379
interface or through basically anything

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,599
on a standard data network that then

00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:23,169
means you could feed it into I single or

00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,940
zabbix if you wanted to and the company

00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:28,349
that produced these things they provide

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,789
a web interface that just has standard

00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:35,499
indicators of the current conditions and

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:37,469
historical trends rather than expecting

00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:40,209
people to use a normal computer network

00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:41,829
management system but obviously if

00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,659
you're a geek you can make this work

00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:50,679
with anything you want to along the

00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:57,820
lines of a monitoring network going a

00:32:50,679 --> 00:33:01,450
bit bigger some people keep cows and we

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,950
generally call them farmers and there

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,379
are particular times when you're

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:09,489
especially interested in how the cows

00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:11,709
getting on are they happy mainly when

00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,409
they're pregnant and they're going to

00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:16,389
produce another cow and there's not a

00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,009
great deal of time between thinking that

00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:20,259
a cow is about to give birth and he's

00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:22,509
actually doing so and you don't want to

00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,889
have to keep on wondering out to the

00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:28,989
barn and keeping an eye on this all the

00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:30,999
time about twenty percent of cows have

00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:33,339
complications during the first time they

00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:36,639
give birth to a calf that's quite a high

00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:38,769
proportion even what's described as more

00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,389
experienced cows and having

00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:44,789
complications during about eight percent

00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:47,409
of births so twenty percent of the time

00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,629
cows giving birth for the first time

00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:50,440
have a problem and this problem could

00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:52,330
result in the day

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,830
of the car for example very very

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,610
occasionally the death of the cow itself

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,740
but three percent of all cars died

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,590
during birth and for farmers that's

00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:05,049
quite an economic consideration the cost

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,990
of keeping and feeding a cow over the

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,970
period of time that it takes to give

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,589
birth through another cow and the only

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,139
give birth to one as a time there's not

00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:16,210
like puppies or something means that

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,669
three percent dying during birth if you

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,280
can do anything to improve on that then

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,230
it's a good idea to do so so if you can

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,510
get any sort of advance warning that a

00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,240
cow is going to give birth in the next

00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,579
few hours this gives farmers a good

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,579
benefit a good advantage in making sure

00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:38,050
that they don't experience problems so

00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:39,879
somebody has come up with a device which

00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:46,990
I can only express as you insert this

00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:49,450
into your cow it is an internally fitted

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,909
sensor it monitors the temperature of

00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:55,270
the cow and it monitors the contractions

00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:57,550
associated is giving birth it has a

00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:00,280
short-range wireless connection to a

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,710
relay device which then allows the

00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,250
farmer to be notified by a slightly more

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:08,380
standard text message or something and

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:11,619
the alert is provided generally by SMS

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:15,250
to a mobile phone that's a summary of

00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:17,800
the kit of parts that you get where this

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,770
is the device which you insert into the

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,990
cow and that's the relay station which

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:26,800
you plug in somewhere nearby so it's a

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:29,650
short-range wireless connection I don't

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,869
know 10 to 50 meters something like that

00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,210
so within the barn where the cows live

00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:36,339
you normally have cows contained within

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,440
an indoor environment when they're about

00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:39,609
to give birth in the next week or so you

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,520
don't tend to let them wander around

00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:44,349
open in the fields and because it's

00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,420
quite likely that they give birth out in

00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,550
the open the young calf will have

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,050
problems because of the temperature so

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,490
you keep them indoors and then there's a

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,440
little wireless antenna which is used

00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,810
and this thing contains the SIM card and

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,030
has all the necessary connections for

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,109
gsm communication on to the mobile

00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,770
network now that seems quite a neat idea

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:05,720
but

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,150
it's it's not necessary for everybody

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,690
and fortunately somebody else come up

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:14,570
with a non-invasive method of doing this

00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,480
so you can place a sensor on the tail of

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,730
the cow and what it does it actually

00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,860
measures the movement of tail patterns

00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,170
and throw it measures patterns of tail

00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,250
movement it turns out that if you

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,660
monitor the way a cow is moving its tail

00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,700
it changes the way it does that when

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,130
it's about to give birth to a cough and

00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,750
when I say about to something like an

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:40,730
hour or so from now so the device

00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,800
monitors the intensity of these tail

00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,020
movements over a period of time there's

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,000
a preset threshold which indicates yeah

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,910
the cow is likely to give birth soon and

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,660
it sends an SMS text alert on average

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:55,430
one hour before birth takes place I've

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,690
just realized something here I should

00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,400
have plugged in a little earlier I

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:05,030
haven't explained this but I will do

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:08,240
later I shall move that to there and

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,500
then tell you why in a few minutes I was

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,980
distracted by trying to get the screen

00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,720
running unfortunately anyway so then

00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,120
since the text alert to the farmer on

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,500
average one hour before the cow is about

00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:23,720
to give birth and that gives plenty of

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,720
opportunity for thy other farmer or and

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,400
a vet to be able to attend and see is

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,470
the cow having difficulty as the calf

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,190
having difficulty and save quite a large

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:36,710
proportion of those three percent that's

00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,830
what the device looks like so it's a

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,990
plastic device about that size have a

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,270
hole in the center and a clip around the

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,430
edge and you simply clip this on to the

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:48,470
tail of the cow and which I consider to

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:52,280
be far more convenient than the previous

00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:54,770
one but we saw that's an example of how

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,950
you put it on so there's a cow's tail

00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,980
there place the device around it clip it

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:03,470
on and then it's it immediately sends an

00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,500
alert to your telephone to say okay I'm

00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:09,410
installed powered detecting some

00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,780
movement and you can check that the

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,880
thing is able to give you an alert this

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,680
this device itself contains all of the

00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,430
GSM electronics and the sim card in

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,579
order to be able to send out

00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,650
alerts so it's completely self-contained

00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,050
that doesn't depend on having another

00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,780
base station anywhere within the the

00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,089
barn or within the vicinity you don't

00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,690
have to have power nearby for example

00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:36,240
and the batteries inside this thing are

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,579
designed to last for about 10 days two

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,550
weeks or so because you would often

00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,559
place place it onto a cow something like

00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,809
a week before you expect birth is going

00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:49,380
to occur you've got that sort of

00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,940
predictability but you don't know the

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,280
exact day you certainly don't know the

00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,520
exact hour and these sorts of things

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,109
help considerably and it fits into my

00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,630
definition of monitoring simply because

00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:02,099
it's measuring something specific it's

00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,079
measuring the movements of the cowl the

00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:06,930
contractions of the the cow in the

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,609
previous version it's comparing them

00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,640
against a threshold of what is normal

00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:13,920
what indicates something that is of

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,140
interest and then it sends an alert when

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,089
it passes that threshold so that

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,940
somebody can react and reaction in this

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,099
case means a better health for the cow

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:29,910
and for the calf and better economics

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:33,240
for the farmer the last example of want

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:36,180
to give involves Lego and I placed an

00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,250
object here on the lectern and didn't

00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:42,119
mention what it was but I'll give you a

00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,619
live demonstration now there's a light

00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,690
on the front of this which is flashing

00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:48,390
every now again there's a view here in a

00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,910
position to see it I'll mention you when

00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,650
it does it will see that it's someone of

00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,650
three different colors that's just

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:59,069
flashed green it's actually connected up

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,680
to a movement device here which i

00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:03,210
plugged in earlier and it doesn't really

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,410
matter what this is measuring it could

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,609
be the position of something that could

00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,530
be the temperature of something it could

00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:10,319
be a water level I'm just using this as

00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,510
an indicator of a measurement taking

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,210
place if I move this over into the

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,650
yellow area here then the next flashes

00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,079
which occur on the front will be

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:22,619
approximately yellow or orange and so on

00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:27,710
and while it's doing that i shall switch

00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,710
over to the next screen oh good

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,960
right

00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:54,730
welcome back to economic so what we have

00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:58,000
here is a position indication that says

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,890
101 at the moment and there's a warning

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,870
level at 90 and you can see up at the

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,270
top and this is standard I singer to

00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,610
interface and you can see up the top the

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:10,870
result warning level which has been true

00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:13,450
for 46 seconds if I move this over into

00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:17,110
the red section then the next

00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:22,450
measurement that we get which will be

00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:24,520
very soon now within the next few

00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:28,560
seconds the next measurement that we get

00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:31,240
should show a critical value up there oh

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,640
good lovely and it shows that the

00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:37,630
position is now 139 so it's showing the

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,350
position of this is actually just

00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:45,060
measuring the rotation from 0 through to

00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:49,000
90 through to 180 if I put it back to

00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:51,160
something around about 50 or so then

00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,650
we'll see that the position comes back

00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:58,870
to some right 50 and the critical alert

00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:01,360
will disappear it's is measuring roughly

00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,700
every 20 seconds or so so it shouldn't

00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,210
take too long to do you want ok so the

00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:10,090
position is 61 I was slightly under

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:13,960
optimistic about my measurement and as

00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:17,670
you can see it's building up the the

00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:23,290
graph here let's see if I can get that

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:30,310
shown a bit better so if i zoom in to

00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:32,980
this section of the graph we can see

00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,590
that it is monitoring the position of

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,230
that sensor and it will come back down

00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,240
it does take pnp for nagios a lot while

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,060
to react with the round robin database

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,460
that uses it back end but it will come

00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,540
back down into the non-critical level in

00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,720
order to represent the current

00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,070
measurement value of 61 there's a couple

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,930
of measurements that I'm doing on this

00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,790
thing at the moment and the position of

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,530
the pointer is one of them and the

00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,660
battery level it uses rechargeable

00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:01,600
batteries inside and is the other one

00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:06,100
and we can see a similar graph

00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:09,060
of that if I switch back to the services

00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,880
the other service I've got is battery

00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:21,370
now if I look at the for our graph this

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:26,830
time actually let's try 25 to see

00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:28,540
whether yes that will show the decrease

00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,130
a little easier on the spice space I've

00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,810
got available in screen you can see the

00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:34,630
drop in battery level since I switched

00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:37,930
it on at around about lunchtime now

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:40,750
that's not particularly exciting or

00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:44,740
interesting however the whole reason why

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,600
I brought this along is the icinga

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:51,130
monitoring system is running inside

00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,310
there this is running icinga I was

00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,530
intrigued that that was at all possible

00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:58,990
and I've brought along the demonstration

00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:03,340
simply to show that that works what it's

00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:05,780
based on is it's Lego Mindstorms brick

00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:10,580
there's three jet

00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:12,590
erations of them over the years I've got

00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:16,040
little pictures of them here but yeah

00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:17,480
the earliest one is from 1998 and Lego

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,040
themselves produce a graphical

00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,860
programming environment for these things

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,380
which I find horrible I can't use it I'm

00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:28,580
a text programmer somebody came up with

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:30,320
a language called not quite see it it

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,910
looks like see feels like see but it's

00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,410
limited it's restricted because of the

00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,000
capabilities of this thing there's no

00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,820
floating-point mats for example and

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,100
there's only limited range of functions

00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,180
available for it you don't have

00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,730
extensive maths libraries stuff like

00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,080
that but if you can programming City you

00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,870
can get on with this language perfectly

00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,360
well when Lego themselves produce the

00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:53,620
next version in 2006 they open sourced

00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:56,120
the firmware as well the the entire

00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,800
software that's loaded onto the machine

00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,500
they produce software development kits

00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,210
to encourage other people to actually

00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,300
come up with alternative programming

00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:07,550
environments the response of the people

00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,900
who develop not quite see was to take

00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:13,460
the initials here and come up with not

00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:16,820
exactly see and which was a derivative

00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,320
which took an account of the greater

00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,820
capabilities of the hardware in this

00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,670
thing just to give you an idea of what

00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:25,010
the hardware is by the way the earliest

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:28,250
version it's an 8-bit h8 processor

00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:31,190
running at 16 megahertz and it's got 32

00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,620
k of ram inside it your programs fit

00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:36,650
into 32 kilobytes of RAM the next

00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:38,750
version they both did it up to a 32-bit

00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,480
arm 7 processor running at a whopping

00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:45,110
forty eight megahertz and they fitted it

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:48,320
with 64 kilobytes of RAM and the latest

00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:51,950
version this one here has a 32-bit arm

00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:54,710
nine it's been around since 2013 runs at

00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:59,150
300 megahertz and has 64 megabytes of

00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:00,830
RAM now the amusing thing about it from

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,500
my point of view is Lego supply running

00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,480
Linux natively when you buy it's got

00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,770
linux inside it they don't make a big

00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,660
issue out of that they don't expect

00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,310
people to throw me away certainly the

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,040
children that is aimed at don't really

00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:19,010
care but it runs night lineups natively

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:21,350
by default so a group came up with

00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,710
an alternative version called ev3 dev

00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,970
and it's a debian linux based

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,980
distribution which you can install onto

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:31,340
the device to make it far more like

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:33,230
linux ev3 as its supplied by lego is

00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:36,260
designed for programming again with

00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:38,060
their graphical environment and simply

00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:42,020
based round motors and sensors you plug

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:44,480
in this puts a far more standard LEGO

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,210
just sorry linux distribution onto your

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,000
LEGO brick and this is what it looks

00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,580
like when you log into it you get a

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,110
welcome login it's running Debbie and

00:46:52,580 --> 00:47:02,720
Jesse on it yes it got the last login

00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:04,910
and if you list the contents of / ET see

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,580
such icinga to you've got all of the

00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:10,940
standard directories there I'll show you

00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:14,750
that on this one I've got a login

00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:18,170
session here so up in the top left hand

00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:20,360
corner of this display I can see its IP

00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:25,430
address it's connected to the OS MC

00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:27,860
wireless network here so if I log in to

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,510
that robot is a standard user name

00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,970
that's installed on the machine by

00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:34,040
default I've installed my public key on

00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:36,410
it so from this laptop I can log in

00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,240
without a password anybody else is

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:41,660
welcome to ping that address but you

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,260
won't be able to ssh to it and and I get

00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:49,070
the the standard welcome message there

00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:53,180
if I say Sam hearing your name I can

00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:57,290
find out yes its host name is ev3 dev

00:47:53,180 --> 00:48:01,010
it's running a 4.4 colonel it's got an

00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:05,560
armed version 5 processor in it and yes

00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:05,560
it's got a standard debian Jessie

00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:15,950
installation and you can stall whatever

00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:17,780
packages you like songs they fit in 64

00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:21,200
megabytes of RAM or songs they will run

00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,730
sensibly in 64 megabytes of RAM the way

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,970
you actually put this system onto the

00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:29,420
LEGO brick is quite simple it has a

00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:31,520
micro SD card slot in the side you put

00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,960
the image onto that plug it in and then

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,670
the next time you turn it on

00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,349
boots from that instead of from its

00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:40,130
internal firmware so you're not

00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:43,310
replacing the internal firmware and you

00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:48,410
can as I say use apt to install standard

00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:53,960
packages and run linux applications on

00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:55,609
your LEGO brick such as my finger so I'd

00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,810
like to thank a few people for the

00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:57,859
information they've given me in the help

00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:00,920
they give me in the pictures they

00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:02,810
provided for this presentation Martin

00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,700
glance is the guy behind the power so

00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,770
the power installation with the

00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,440
instrumentation Jenny Bailey and

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:12,440
Jennifer little run the beehives and

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,099
gave me the images from that and there's

00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,540
an company called open aquarium which

00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:21,020
you can find plenty of information out

00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:22,550
on cooking hacks com I'm not quite sure

00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,280
what it's got to do with cooking because

00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:27,349
it it kind of bothers me that you're

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,730
running keeping tropical fish and you

00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:31,130
find out how to monitor them from

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:34,099
cooking hacks and makes you think how

00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,440
often does this go wrong and then the

00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,720
two cow monitoring systems which I

00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,310
showed you and the internal one from

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,220
unitronic and the external one from

00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:47,900
mukul so that was my overview of

00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,070
monitoring all sorts of things in the

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,320
real world that you wouldn't normally

00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:55,520
come across with I singer or zabbix on

00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,710
navigator and how useful it can be to

00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:03,830
actually put instrumentation in unusual

00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:08,390
places do we have any questions yes do

00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:11,330
we have a microphone lovely so how many

00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:14,330
people have used your account contents

00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:16,150
besides you so far or to put the

00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,349
question that probably everybody had our

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,810
don't your banks use two-factor

00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:26,359
authentication and how can you sleep

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:27,830
okay Deutsche Bank does use two-factor

00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:30,920
authentication when you want to make a

00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,990
transaction however to log in and get

00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,400
read-only access no you just have a

00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:39,470
standard well not exactly username and a

00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,910
password deutsche bank wants new your

00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,609
branch number which is public

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:45,680
information your account number which is

00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:46,430
public information and a five digit PIN

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,910
code

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:52,099
which isn't and that's it with with that

00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:53,270
you can log in to deutsche bank and see

00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:54,890
the account if you want to make a

00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:59,109
transaction then you need a one-time

00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:05,869
password which you get from them with

00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:08,420
santander and bank of scotland there are

00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:11,329
no one-time passwords so with both of

00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:14,839
those i need to login with two pieces of

00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:16,819
information which are private to me but

00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:19,670
then i can make whatever transactions i

00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:21,319
like now obviously there is a security

00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,880
consideration of the machine that's

00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:25,190
running the icinga instance that needs

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,349
to be able to do the login but my

00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,230
attitude to that is provided that is on

00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:31,730
an internal network to myself I can only

00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:35,569
make outbound connections to the

00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:37,160
external world and is protected by

00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:39,770
firewalls or network address translation

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,109
or whatever for inbound connections I'm

00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,940
happy with that ok the Deutsche Bank was

00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:45,290
the situation with the Deutsche Bank was

00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,599
what I was kind of expecting and hoping

00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:49,910
for the other one still would give me a

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,349
bit of creeps yeah and I have to admit

00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,910
that I also expect a three-level

00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:55,250
temperature monitoring and cows but oh

00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:57,740
well that's probably better like with

00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:01,069
the bees like lower level temperature

00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:10,329
and so on ok thank you next okay anybody

00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:10,329
else anyone else right at the frontier

00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:19,579
one question 1 comment and how often has

00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:23,459
your scraping of the dogger bank failed

00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:27,209
in terms of if they change something

00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:29,549
then you're scraping breath yeah you're

00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:30,900
right and striping a website is a risk

00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:33,119
in terms of they change the interface

00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,009
they actually changed it about 10 days

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,380
two weeks ago but not in a way that

00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:40,709
affected my script I've been running

00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:43,140
that script for 18 months now so now

00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:46,019
that without any problems however you're

00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,519
correct coming up with something like

00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,219
this myself which isn't officially

00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:52,410
supported by them is vulnerable to them

00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:53,940
changing oh we've got a wonderful new

00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,650
appearance dry website you now login

00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,559
using the following things instead and

00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:02,400
it all falls over so it can happen it

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,609
has happened with Amazon but it was

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,079
relatively easy to fix I get the

00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:08,400
advantage that as you saw earlier the

00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:10,410
scripts themselves are quite simple is

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,109
not very many web fetches needed in

00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:15,509
order to get at the data and but it

00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:17,130
could happen you're right thank you and

00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:19,229
then just one comment it was a great

00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:21,869
talk very good fun and there's only one

00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:28,529
way you can improve improve it next time

00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:32,539
bring a cow hahaha thank you okay thanks

00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:32,539
