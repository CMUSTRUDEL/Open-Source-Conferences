Description: 
	We hoped the creation of the Horizon and Meridian distributions of OpenNMS would help accelerate innovation. How right we were!
Since altering the release and distribution model, the project and the company have been busy improving the user experience. For the newest users and ones just starting to explore their interest, we launched new websites for the project (opennms.org) and documentation (docs.opennms.org). For large-scale users pushing the boundaries of RRDTool for data storage, we shipped four releases with support for storing metrics in Newts (our Cassandra-based data store). For users needing to scale the whole solution horizontally, we made two releases incorporating the new Minion distributed architecture. The and ReST API has continued to see improvements, making OpenNMS an even better platform for integration. New northbound interfaces for events and alarms, and broadened support for third-party trouble ticket platforms, further strengthen the integration story. The platform's ability to speak many management protocols has grown with the addition of support for WS-Management (and by extension, WinRM). End user-facing enhancements include improvements to the web UI, a new Business Service Monitoring subsystem, and updates to the Topology UI. We also added evil usage statistics collection to help us better understand how people use OpenNMS (participation is opt-in only, and the data is published at stats.opennms.org).
