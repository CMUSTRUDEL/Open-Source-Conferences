hi everybody thank you for joining us

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,430
for this presentation first of all I

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,649
would like to apologize because as most

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,969

so I hope you will understand everything

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,300
second information it's not a technical

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,969
presentation but it's the point of view

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,199
of central about our should be a

00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:06,580
moratorium platform and last information

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:09,550
how many fan of some of our present okay

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,340
whoo two three four

00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,220
Oh lovely so let's start this

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,620
presentation I'm Laura Percy be project

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:23,050
owner of central open source solution

00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:26,820
and I'm joined today by Community

00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:30,760
Managers and tram and already engineer

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,670
so together are walking four together we

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,350
work for the central company since many

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:41,920
years central it's there of course the

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,520
editor of San Fran solution we are small

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,150
company but we are trust by small and

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,950
medium business and fortune 500 we are

00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:56,770
an industry reference in open source

00:01:50,950 --> 00:02:01,560
because Montreal begin destroy the 11

00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:08,800
years ago we have in the world more than

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:11,819
200,000 users and 400 customers how

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:18,850
solution open so solution are download

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:22,510
three three thousand times parents so a

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,800
quick history I suppose everybody know

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:29,980
net sent and itself

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:32,650
in 1999 three after nelson's change the

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,400
name for nagios due to trademark issue

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:41,050
and one hour after the apparition of

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:45,070
negus how first solution appear and was

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,690
named Oreo so Ariane was the first into

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,480
web interface to manage

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,580
Nagios and to display a collected data

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,870
it was also the first solution to of

00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:04,600
graph with Nagas and to manage SNMP TG

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:06,970
traps this solution was developed by two

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,980
students Ramana Mary Angela mattes and

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:14,500
they choose to create the society

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,650
previously named marriages so marriages

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,370
was a company to offer professional

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:30,250
services and integration services for

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:35,260
Oreo in 211 marriages decide to

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:39,190
Nagios and also ndo due to some program

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,440
with Nagas team for some example we send

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,440
patch for nagios to correct Samberg and

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:51,480
not all patch was including in tuna

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,480
girls we needed some new features 12 and

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,440
distributed platform and Nagios does not

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,650
use this way so we decided to fork and

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,570
create how brokers and how brokers and

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:10,780
from broker and how an Giants on trend

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:13,420
right in June 2012

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,049
we decided to package how solution and

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,239
create a distribution using sent us and

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:24,760
package every dependencies and some

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:29,470
software and last year we decide to

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,870
rename how society to some trail for

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,990
more facility with how customer and how

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:40,460
user so I don't explain this but

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,410
we change the name of the software or we

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:49,550
on choose on trail due to trademark

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:51,770
issue - so what are the main challenge

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,000
to implement monitoring that is the

00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:00,080
question the first part is for us the

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,800
scalability you have you are you have in

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,380
your company DMZ resulting zone and you

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,930
don't want to bypass firewall rules or

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:14,330
security rules to monitor all of your

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:17,419
equipment you work in a big company and

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:24,250
you don't want to monitor Tokyo servers

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:27,680
from Island DC it's all evidence you

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,330
your company grow grow grow everywhere

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
else you have a lot of service to

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,479
monitor a lot of new equipment to

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,180
monitor a lot of micro service monitor

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,530
and you need to monitor and to collect

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,740
data of this loose equipment and last

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,389
void you need the real time so we don't

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,760
want to have latency on your main

00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:52,639
platform how can do this

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:57,080
how solution try to be the most global

00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:00,500
as possible you can manage many many

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,370
many Polar's from a unique interface so

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,380
you can put polar in jimsy resources own

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,639
just next to your equipment to collect

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:14,000
information you need to have a deposit

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,870
DBMS to reduce IO and you need a unique

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,960
interface to manage everywhere every

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,330
Polar's database and a unique interface

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:33,710
to centralize collect data and to this

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:36,650
resin a second part it's the data that

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,820
are really important to use you I

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,710
suppose you participate to time service

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,960
presentation and also presentation in

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,909
other presences who's our profession

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,660
says you need to collect data to collect

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,540
data to collect data

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,020
- to make some graph and to generate

00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:58,140
alerts so data are really important in

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:01,560
the monitoring platform if you don't

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,680
have data you can generate event if you

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,420
can generate event you can't generate a

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,910
let if you don't have a lot you can't

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,020
react and if you can't react you will

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:17,360
lose money so that are really really

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,420
really important so two points you don't

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:30,170
you can't lose data and you need to

00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:33,150
secure your data how we can perform this

00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,510
you need when you collect data to store

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,790
data locally if you have an link issue

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,210
between your polar and you main platform

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:46,260
so you need to store all data in memory

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,840
and also in a fellow of file locally if

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,070
you process crash you need to keep data

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,550
and two recent data you need also to

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,440
have the possibility to transfer data at

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,300
many destination if you have a fell over

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,420
infrastructure you can send that that to

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:09,900
the master and also to the slave if you

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:12,510
have issue you need to secure your data

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,270
you have you must have the possibility

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,730
to first encrypt the flow between the

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,310
sender and the receiver and you can

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,800
authenticate the sender to be sure that

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,170
this under its elevated to send data to

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,490
the main platform so you can use such

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:34,219
picot and TLS encryption I forgot no

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:39,599
okay perfect

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:42,780
so how broker it's a multi input multi

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,900
output and all of you forward data

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,540
everywhere to compress that to anchor

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,860
read that to adopt offical with a decade

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,480
Sanders and if the broker can connect to

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,430
the master it used automatically

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,530
available to connect to the slave and if

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,810
you can contact the slave automatically

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,490
store data into a failover file locally

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,740
and when the connection

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,070
up here again the broker we will send

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,350
every data to to zoomin platform so with

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,270
this system you don't lose that up and

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,089
you secure your data if you have to

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,709
transfer that round MPLS on on a one on

00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,540
the line i don't know but you have to

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,450
secure your data and you have to be sure

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,310
that all collected data will arrive to

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,330
the main platform to generate event

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:34,890
elliot and for your updates to react on

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:38,070
a yet another point is the accessibility

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:41,810
to your monitoring platform you need to

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:46,410
have a simply and clear user interface

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:50,279
the fourth the access to the interface

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,000
is for everyone in your company for the

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:56,430
collaborator were using an application

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,670
for of course the monitoring team at the

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,950
Steam sis and me natural convene for the

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,580
application manager application manager

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:08,120
must know if he is Adam is the

00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,820
application is a little available or not

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,430
for your CTO and for your CEO you see

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,279
you must know if business is okay or not

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,329
so everyone in your company must have an

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,520
access to your monitoring platform so

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,220
you monitoring platform as you Marie

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:32,390
excuse me your monitoring interface may

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:34,950
be simple and clear with filters with

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,770
most allowed to offer real-time

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,640
monitoring without latency and must solo

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:45,420
to display performance data to follow a

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,850
numeric data collected moreover you need

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:52,050
to use User Profile User Profile is

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:57,839
really important your collaborator using

00:10:52,050 --> 00:11:00,690
an application method must not see every

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,720
collected data on the on the new user

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,630
interface sorry so you need to create a

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,720
lot of profile profile for collaborators

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,120
profile for monitoring profile for DBA

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,459
profile for CEO profit for CTO profile

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,200
for application manager you need to

00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,080
create a lot of profile

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,640
fulfilled with user group in you LDAP so

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,360
when you user connect to your resident

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:29,040
surface user will see that you have to

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:32,340
see user profile always to manage

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,350
resource and to perform some action to

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,200
acknowledge to put done time recurring

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,200
done time to reschedule a check so you

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,110
can manage this section using using

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,690
profile and whisper fill you can also

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:50,670
manage access to different menu of your

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:54,000
user interface the last point for the

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:58,620
accessibility is the possibility to have

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,660
a local web interface on the polar if

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,700
you have a big company your main

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,570
platform is an island or Paris for

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,790
example you have server in Tokyo if a

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,930
user in Tokyo don't have to connect to

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,930
Paris to see Tokyo resources so you can

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,580
connect just to the polar in Tokyo you

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,270
have a display of all collected data

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:24,360
locally and if we have a problem between

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,060
Tokyo and Paris the link is broken the

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:31,230
user can continue to see collect data

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,630
and can manage this data locally to

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,390
perform an external edge or to put it on

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,300
time so you need to have a new web

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,430
interface on each follow locally and

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,350
many interface to manage all the

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,830
infrastructure and to display all

00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:49,760
collected data that's also at of Yuma

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,760
don't worry

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,490
after accessibility another point is the

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,190
correlation and the aggregation of data

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm sure that everyone have installed

00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:07,140
the first time Nagas receive a lot of

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,100
mail in mailbox maybe you wanna do a 200

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:15,090
400 and create a routes to from Nagios

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:19,200
to trash I suppose I do this in the past

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,910
so you need to correlate all events to

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,100
find the root cause it's really

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,130
important suit you need to send all

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,880
information on a unique point to

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,660
correlate all information

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,330
to create rules to find the root cause

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:42,620
this allowed to reduce the MTT air

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:43,250
meantime to Reaper I suppose I forgot

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:56,140
something

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:58,490
just let me check no perfect lovely

00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,960
excuse me I'm a little bit nervous it's

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:06,530
the first time I made a presentation in

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:08,870
English my colleague also so you need in

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:13,100
your solution a tools to aggregate data

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,980
and calculate them why you need this

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,680
because I suppose you start to collect

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,650
technical indicators a lot of technical

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,090
indicators but technical indicators

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,030
itself does not a lot you have a vision

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,790
a business vision of your activity but

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,460
your CEO and your CTO need to have a

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,980
business vision your CEO needs to be

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:38,450
sure that if you have an e-commerce

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:44,240
website you can sell some items so you

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:46,040
need to first part of your business deal

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,180
in your business in application decline

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,790
your application into a KPI and which

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,520
KPI select correct technical indicators

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:59,510
that you have two monitors so in this

00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,960
example rights is not a correct example

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:06,230
but we can see that we have on the right

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,690
side technical indicators we have 100

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:12,680
catchers in a critical state these

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,070
indicators have an impact on meta

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,060
indicators here this maternity catchers

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:23,330
have another impact here and this and

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:27,950
meta a super indicator said I have an

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:34,370
issue with my mail services so I have to

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:36,980
react quickly so to do correlation you

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:40,130
need first to start with business view

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:43,370
what is your business in your company

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,740
the final application that allowed to

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,680
perform the business when you have

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,900
application fine kPa and when you have

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,910
kept here fine technical indicators that

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,210
you have to use to calculate this kPa

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,210
state

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,190
Michael I try to explain you what the

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:08,150
difference between a technical part and

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:12,290
a pitch business part see me trying it

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:16,280
for that was him business but I love

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:20,540
business business it's important your

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,990
company will work for make money and you

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:29,750
need to monitor your business not only

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:33,470
you technical server on matrix the first

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:36,710
example is cluster see a point of view

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,000
of technical view if I I have twin on

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:42,320
one two three

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,500
and it might winner is up my first time

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,510
is up I can get data from my crystal if

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:54,680
one side I have to learn more

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,620
my crystal is good I have I get can get

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:03,560
get data no problems

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:05,959
do not tell ya I can get data but it's a

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,470
warning because the next time will not

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,250
fail

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:16,699
I have no a critical error its technical

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:21,350
and don't take the performance the issue

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:27,380
performance in this example it's a good

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:32,180
view for technical operation but when I

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:38,810
use an application view this point of

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:42,530
view is to Mike final customer he for

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:46,460
example will see her website ecommerce

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:51,080
website is the same cluster Twinner if

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,190
my first got my first not sign a new

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,100
issue as

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,460
tomorrow I consider up a tune on it's a

00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:03,950
good performance for my application no

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:06,350
issue but if my second not fail my

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,500
customer gain can get data no problem

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,080
but it's a performance issue I mean bad

00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,620
user experience for my customer and you

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,700
want

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,480
I've by the I want not my customer I by

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,510
his parents

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,890
I must write quickly for correct this

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:28,850
point this problem when you build your

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:32,180
my trying sink by your business and you

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,760
service you provide to a customer East

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:41,930
because Anton customer or external

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:47,030
customer for I deliver for visualize his

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:49,420
point of view we had affirmed system - -

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,420
boring

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:59,300
yeah we have - wrong we are presented

00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:03,740
for it for network administrator it's a

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:07,670
list of my firewall on all service on my

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:11,270
phone I'll check on my phone interview

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:17,120
for technical administrator this you

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:22,010
know not on not 10 year anti-west CEO or

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,300
for internal because is technical

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:29,080
information it's in this slide we have a

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:35,600
complex - ground with multiple widget

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:40,780
and in seed widget we have a very high

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:45,140
rate of mail services this number can be

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:49,420
cheap for by everyone everyone can

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,200
understand this number you can present

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,010
CEO

00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:02,240
client or technical person this number

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:04,280
even listen to what you mean if you are

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,060
working company on

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:15,710
you display a dashboard to TV

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:19,910
it's your reserves sorry doesn't mean

00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:23,870
more if you have a correct view of your

00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:30,830
Afra structure see global IV by

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:34,250
application someone u7c the is his

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:37,670
application is done you will not call

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,280
the desk no the application is done no

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:47,830
some technical person work of these

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:57,070
problems the metering is for everyone so

00:20:47,830 --> 00:21:04,190
next shot is the number of miles and Q

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:09,380
is too technical view it is one it is

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:13,700
not tighten its capacity planning from

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:18,110
action is too good view for CTO for know

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:23,420
is play it must be ad server in

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:27,080
Twitter's three months one years did

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,140
avoid fact data he's coming

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:37,100
not very aware I stick but we didn't

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:40,460
space this network traffic you cannot

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,340
have a steeper in from I to decide if

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:48,500
you must grow your first picture or

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:52,150
reduce your faster to answer last with

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:57,950
jet yeah it's a map we talk about Matt

00:21:52,150 --> 00:22:02,600
after North Eastham up of the malar Afra

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:11,120
structure we have the identification

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:17,630
button and LDAP the fronton my servers

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,440
and Taliban so if using maps apps to see

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,890
and

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:26,890
warping quickly where his problems

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:33,250
yeah we have a one LDAP done on to a

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:33,250
front-end done ECC is quickly and

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,950
everyone can understand

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:48,350
I like I like system yes ma'am

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:52,120
I will be buy-in to part this map

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:55,310
because the top up it's for everyone

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:58,310
everyone can understand so we saw yeah

00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:03,080
II thought if I take the same

00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:04,420
application we know is done not working

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,890
properly

00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:12,860
Milan storage is pocketing property

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:17,330
everyone can use this part can be see

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:20,690
and on TV on an - ball and others were

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,620
present for everyone intercompany say

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:30,490
I'm for cook for commercial team and

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:38,410
those can be used in the bottom we have

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:42,950
a more technical it's not metric anakata

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:47,720
status easy to see but it's more

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:56,690
technical somebody used the Saran don't

00:23:47,720 --> 00:24:02,210
know have to know the data status is -

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:07,220
good - Rob this one this map dummy to

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:11,680
see the workflow of e-commerce website

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:15,710
my increments website nice I think

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:23,330
everyone is its room can say if I make

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:26,120
money or not who is this month now they

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:29,390
are the issue in the bank communication

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,120
I'm not sure I can make money this

00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,290
program when

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,990
I have issue in the bank in

00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:38,980
communication

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:43,270
yeah I have latency from shopping camp

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:48,760
there is no experience of client he's

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:53,020
degrade he will not appreciate to wait

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:56,020
to have to other an internal to the car

00:24:53,020 --> 00:25:03,390
and to have a problem when we make

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:06,580
payment it's a it's a workflow of your

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,340
e-commerce website it's good for to see

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:15,790
for your business if your business is

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:21,190
operational or not okay and as Mike

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:23,740
relates ed monitoring web interface is

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,380
really really for everyone for your CTO

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,030
for your collaborator if you want that

00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,970
your address does not receive a lot of

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,740
call if you all owe to your user to

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,380
connect to your events a fast user can

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,510
see okay I can see the problem and I can

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:41,950
see that some people react on this

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:45,970
problem so everyone must have access to

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:48,640
tools using a predefined menu using a

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,670
possibility to make on dashboard using

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,000
cartography tools and after that you

00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,850
need also reporting reporting is not for

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,740
everyone it's maybe for your each CEO

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:04,840
CTO for your application manager for

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,310
some manager want to improve performance

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,170
of the of the team so for earth

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:13,090
reporting must be divided into four

00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,870
parts the first part is about

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,930
availability and events if you want to

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:24,640
know for example if your app desk

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:27,190
checking accounts quickly event you can

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,980
make a report and on this example you

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:33,160
can see that my team does not take

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:36,220
critical and warning event under five

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:41,770
minutes or under 10 minutes so they are

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:43,059
not so quickly react but they they can

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:48,200
correct

00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:52,370
50% of critical issue in less than 15

00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,790
minutes and 63% of warning issue in less

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:58,850
than 20 minutes so they make a lot of

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:04,990
time to acknowledge services but they

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:07,490
correct it quickly you need for example

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:12,410
availability of all groups the risk

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:16,490
groups of a server of services for

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:20,030
example if I know you I need to know the

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:23,390
rate of mile observers on the last week

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,910
and to compare it with a previous

00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:28,340
generation of reports who know if the

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:32,150
availability increase decrease or it's

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,220
stable another part it's the performance

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,290
of your business application because

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,840
business applications it's really really

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:43,040
important business application although

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,590
you're a society to make business so if

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,850
you want to have a pay you need to be

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,210
sure that your application our

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:54,320
performance in this second part I can

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:58,480
see an application is available 98% on

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:02,360
the last generation and it's better

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,809
about 0.8 percent more than previous

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:10,640
generations so my application is correct

00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:12,710
maybe this week or this month so I can

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,000
see that the availability of my

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,850
application it's 11 hours and it's one

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,870
hour enough better than the previous

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:26,540
period I have issue this may be this

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:31,160
week or this month but it's better than

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:34,419
the previous generation you need also

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,100
report about optimization of resources

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:42,890
if you want to know if your

00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:46,040
infrastructure are in capacity to to

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,080
create a new offer new services you need

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,120
to know the availability rate of your

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,120
server and you need to know if the

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,879
resource of your server superior memory

00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,169
disk or maybe your

00:28:55,879 --> 00:29:03,469
ever our incapacity to produce more so

00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:07,209
you need report for optimization of

00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:11,329
resources for example you need to know

00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:16,819
how many electricity consumption you

00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:20,029
have per month and for us the last part

00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:22,879
and a big part its capacity planning we

00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:27,139
can see a capacity planning ear

00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:29,869
prediction but you know to be new to

00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:32,239
predict when you will have an issue for

00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:35,809
example will will your son when your son

00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:39,019
will be full at 99% you need to know if

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,339
it's two weeks six months you need to

00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:42,249
know if you have to buy some of this

00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:46,099
quickly or not

00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:48,669
so for us you have you need to have

00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:51,649
reporting it's really really interesting

00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:54,409
you your Bosley that suppose maybe not

00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,959
you but your bra's need your CEO and CTO

00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:59,539
needs so you need to add to your

00:29:56,959 --> 00:30:02,349
monetary platform the possibility to

00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,349
make reporting

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:21,879
in many conference in its two days we

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:27,759
talk about up high and trouble T we now

00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:32,409
in company we have many same debate just

00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:37,769
insist and away there are already a

00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:39,039
formation we are burnt away we are the

00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,349
project

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,919
so people links and to the project will

00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:47,489
also contact use the product and this

00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,289
operation is used by metering for

00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:55,299
example if you have your project in your

00:30:50,289 --> 00:31:01,389
son TV you can use some right wing tool

00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:05,200
to use and a way for link people we will

00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:09,899
receive a lot when so application hasn't

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,899
done or to create user profile

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:20,739
in management for us your metering tune

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:24,190
my must be with a mirror of the author

00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:27,909
structure all in terms of for your IT

00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:31,289
system must be in money train the best

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:36,909
way is an automatically automatically

00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:41,139
the resource to the chosen a chain one

00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:45,519
is defined if you use a prepared

00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:48,389
chef when HTTP server is deploy on a

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,089
server okay and you must correct the

00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:57,399
moraine and print photo HTTP power on

00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:59,019
the HTTP server status in your own if

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,299
you can link your continual

00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:03,249
configuration management with your item

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:07,359
when it when platform is to magically

00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:09,309
and up to that so it means that you're

00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,359
monitoring platform is not your same DB

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,779
you have a CMDB

00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:15,819
to two we have a 70 B and you

00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:18,779
multi-platform get information from 70

00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:18,779
BQ collect information

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:28,169
another point is the new autism maybe

00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:35,309
use a change sent to pollute so accident

00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:40,620
in your company when event when an alert

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:42,350
is up in your IT major platform is the

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,860
good way to create

00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:50,370
tjt new attrition and when sir I left is

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:55,679
acknowledge the right ECM must be

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:59,880
up-to-date with the affirmation to

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:04,380
engagement in others office may be in

00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:11,480
your company you use multiple moonshine

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:18,890
homes because young people you need

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,890
because man marching tune don't know

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:29,490
is that good for all you you check

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:32,520
because you want to adapt to my chain

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:37,530
are your to your business and one way to

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,730
a tune if not maybe not enough but the

00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:43,830
merchant soon when we communicate

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:47,669
between because we can create a business

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:53,190
view if your data is one moderator on

00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:56,549
another data must be in your monitoring

00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:00,799
tool to bring in to amendment return to

00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:03,630
build winners you and you can use

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:09,720
another moto it will not I - no way -

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:12,659
like IPM or cure cure if you from moon

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:16,530
monitors user experience of your clients

00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:22,169
and see the data from cismo each return

00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:27,359
must be go to your monitoring for map

00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:30,740
and business you for have the better

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,190
view of your business activity

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:40,159
and now having with the cloud and crew

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:44,869
services your hour or the nose schedule

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:50,200
mr. Oki Sato your Cassata of containers

00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:54,379
must be cured and must been shunned that

00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,300
accurate tools for a statue of numbers

00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:01,030
of containers of statue of containers

00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,030
and such an application in your cloud

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,490
for that

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:13,720
ok ok first you must have a tie you must

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:16,790
communicate by a guy your jaw

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,460
another tools must be communicate to

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,369
your mate written by API on your menu

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,930
item can be communicated to the another

00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,390
tool by al-qaeda

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:30,650
for example the configuration management

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:36,080
can some drug action to create an Austin

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:39,830
and service to might return by API we

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:45,890
can ask create tickets to 80 tools using

00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:50,589
API and if you know each item is module

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:54,349
are modular you can adapt the best way

00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:58,070
your monitoring for your business maybe

00:35:54,349 --> 00:36:04,220
you have some specificity in your

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:06,220
business you need to have some custom

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:10,910
development for your my treatment

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:15,800
yesterday we see conference about many

00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:23,390
to enjoy our work some tools is not I

00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:25,910
think some action is can be used by some

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,810
tools is not slightly tools we know

00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:34,160
every day it's important you use all

00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:36,609
data we can have so winter in our

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,609
business

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,420
okay thank you and to conclude

00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,790
monitoring is ready for everyone

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,810
everyone must have an access to the user

00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:53,119
interface it's really important the

00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,700
second point is that are important you

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,830
don't you can't lose data it's

00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,420
impossible you want to react if you want

00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,609
to don't lose money with your business

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,710
you need to be sure that you can collect

00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,869
data and you can send that out to the

00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,950
main platform and you can new user can

00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:12,590
have an access to this data so please be

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,359
sure that you can you don't lose that

00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,890
out and you don't have latency on your

00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:20,810
platform to be sure that you have real

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:25,010
time and not delay it time another point

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:28,340
is you need to have monitoring tools

00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:31,850
that you can customize because most of

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:34,070
tools implement a predefined menu with

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:36,740
purging five filter but it's not for

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,660
everyone and as I said monitoring is for

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,369
everyone you need to have the

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,640
possibility to customize your interface

00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:46,160
to add to create dashboard to add widget

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,740
to add modules to display that the user

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,880
want to see it's really really important

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:55,790
and last point your monitoring platform

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,400
must be connected to your IT you need to

00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:01,450
keep information from CMDB in the

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,119
checkup to keep information from

00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:07,220
automation you need to communication or

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,350
ticketing tools you need to keep data

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,260
from cloud you will to keep data from

00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:15,200
another monitoring tools so your

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,780
monitoring platform is not alone next to

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,670
your IT your multi platform is in the

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,940
center of your IT and communicate with

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:28,369
every new IT it's really really really

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:30,619
important if you need some more

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:33,560
information we have a demo platform we

00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:37,400
have a website with a blog we have key

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,560
tab with or open source projects we have

00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,630
documentation in English and in French
