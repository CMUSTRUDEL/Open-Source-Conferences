Title: OSMC 2016 | ZMON: Zalando's OS approach to monitoring in the cloud and DCs (EN) by Jan Mussler
Publication date: 2016-12-12

Description: 
	Two years ago we set out to build our own monitoring tool replacing Icinga. Our biggest focus was flexibility and autonomy for the growing number of teams and engineers to enable them to monitor their services from small micro services to databases to higher level business KPIs. Today ZMON provides teams with a federated monitoring solution that gathers data not only in our DCs but also in the connected AWS VPCs and assists teams with service auto discovery and sharing of checks/alerts to make everyone's life easier. ZMON comes along with Grafana2 and KairosDB enabling rich data driven dashboards.
