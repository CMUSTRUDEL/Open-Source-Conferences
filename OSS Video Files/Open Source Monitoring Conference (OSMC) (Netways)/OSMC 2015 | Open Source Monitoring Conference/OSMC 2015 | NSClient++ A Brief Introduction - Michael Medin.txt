Title: OSMC 2015 | NSClient++ A Brief Introduction - Michael Medin
Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	NSClient++ has been growing steadily over the years and with 0.5.0 we are getting ever closer to an official 1.0 version.
Yet still many people only monitor the very basics metrics such as cpu/memory/disk. In this session I will show you how to get the most of NSClient++ and why it is time to say goodbye to check_nt for good.
We will explore NSClient++ left and right but do so from an end user perspective showing you what you can monitor and how easy it is to do so...

the next talk is Mikey medan and he's

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:28,170
talking about DNS client + + better

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,580
awesome one thing that works I would

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,869
just like to say I will not be talking

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,250
about an his client that's just what I

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,070
tell the people to be able to come to

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,330
the conference I I was planning to talk

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,690
about in his client but it didn't really

00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,239
pan out so i'll just do other stuff but

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,170
we'll get into that a little bit

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,149
normally when I do these kind of

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,879
presentation I usually spend the first

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,289
15 minutes talking about myself and the

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,270
reason I do that is because you're going

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,800
to fill 45 minutes if you can take the

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,190
first 15 minutes and just copy them from

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,230
last year you're halfway there right and

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,539
and I'm not going to do that this year

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,840
because I'm gonna do something new if

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,170
the click of the thing is working let's

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,399
go with the other click into thing Oh

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,860
seriously I mean both of them cannot be

00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,899
working okay well let's see what happens

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,119
anyway as you can see there's a huge

00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,979
nagios sign up here and it's not because

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm trying to say that now yo says

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,929
bought and his client or anything like

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,140
that no such luck and the other thing

00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:29,640
you're probably asking yourself is what

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:35,310
seriously are none of the click of the

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,200
things working anymore oh god what is it

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,250
with me so maybe my computer is

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,080
seriously broken right so there is no

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,179
Lego slides right which I always

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,280
promised to do and the reason why there

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,800
is no now yours Lego slide is if you

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,360
google Lego and now use you end up with

00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,200
this which was also kind of ironic

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,030
because I don't really see the

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,970
correlation to be honest but apparently

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,440
there is one so the reason why I bring

00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,319
up nagios is I want to take this

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,899
opportunity to say I'm sorry to non-us

00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,239
enterprises nagas community and pretty

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,819
much everyone in the nagas world and I

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,069
really mean that really sorry and the

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,540
reason is that when i was at their

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,760
conference a couple of years back i

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,040
apparently according to the boston

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,240
street said something along the lines of

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,090
i don't even like nagios

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,490
and I think that might have started some

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,380
bad blood between us because I sent in

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,540
some proposals for the conference the

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,000
year after and I got some rejections

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,820
back and then I sent in some proposals

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,220
for the year or this year and I got some

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,100
rejections back so I just want to say in

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,830
the event that nagios somehow thinks

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,820
that I don't like their product I was

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,500
kidding it's not true so what I really

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,450
trying to say here is that I actually

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,660
love nagios and I loved it so much that

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,320
that I've created a slide with hearts on

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,150
it that's how much I love now use and

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,560
let's let's just review that again

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,360
because it's an awesome animation you

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,240
know it's it's beautiful and that brings

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,330
us to the other side right because there

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,490
is this other tool and and I figured you

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,230
know maybe I can buy some leverage we do

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,110
now use people by essentially you know

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,180
doing a whole thing about I singer when

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,560
I go to the conference but the

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,990
interesting thing about this slide is

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,910
that there's again no Legos and the

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,280
reason is if you google I singer and

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,070
Legos not only do you find burnt but

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,560
also me which apparently have some sort

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,840
of affiliation with icing up I can do

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,780
the Legos yes but not the icinga match

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,760
but Google never lies right but when i

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,280
was doing these googling for for sort of

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,420
researching for my slides i encountered

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,790
this one as well which was kind of

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,860
ironic because if you google i sing and

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,650
logo you will find a lot of nagios logos

00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,170
and a lot of savage Lagos and then we it

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,250
down you will find some I sing alongs

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,460
but in essence what I'm trying to say

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,410
here is you know i Singa sucks and it

00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,140
sucks really bad and i have prepared

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,360
about 15 minutes of words of slides you

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,730
know essentially just dissing the icinga

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,370
monitoring tool which i will happily run

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,110
at the nagas World Conference 2016 and I

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,430
mean it's everything from classics like

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,230
you know if you can't understand the

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,299
code you can always rewrite it to you

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,700
know good artists copy and really bad

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,830
artist just steal and that kind of stuff

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,680
so it's it's essentially in 15 minutes

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,340
not equate with you know how bad i Singa

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,660
socks and and I just you know if in

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,160
someone from my singing is here

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,100
listening I was going to say I'm kidding

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:41,320
so so I actually

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,840
low sorry love I sing as well yeah so

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,310
this brings us to the big thing this

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,710
year right because this is the 10th

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,570
anniversary of the conference and I

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,760
figured since I don't have anything to

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,220
present this year I could at least you

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,550
know do some copies on my slide from

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,170
last year so that's essentially what i'm

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,730
going to do let's see if the clicker

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,980
works seriously so in essence this is

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,800
when it all started for me as you can

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,900
see the slides matches the nice nagios

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,970
conference logo because when this

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,220
started it was not actually 0 smc then

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,190
it was n NK which sounds a lot more

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,000
chairman omc sounds like an american

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,770
conference whereas and NK is more german

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,110
and as you can see i tried to sort of go

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,210
and say you know hey I almost does this

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,800
in in German because i spelled nÃ¼rnberg

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:35,020
with the weird you character thing and

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,050
not the way we spell it in the rest of

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,310
the world and my presentation was

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,000
essentially a new trying to tell people

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,070
don't use check aunty use check nrpe or

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,930
something else because anna's client is

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,300
not designed for check and he's designed

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,310
for check aunty support incidentally

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,650
that is the byline for this year's topic

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,560
as well so it seems like no one listens

00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,240
to me and and here's the interesting bit

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,570
because this is the way you guys looked

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,500
in 2008 and and it looks quite much the

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:08,380
same actually there are some differences

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,060
but but pretty much the same this brings

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,310
us to the next year and here we can see

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,260
that the whole stuff up here started to

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,410
happen right because this is when the

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,300
then trade war started between nagios

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,770
and the rest of the world so in essence

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,480
everyone had to rebrand everything

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,340
called nagios so then it was the open

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,350
source monitoring conference on nagios

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,710
but notice how the naga stuff is like

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,870
it's the center theme of the logo and I

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,540
was talking about application monitoring

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,540
which is essentially last year's talk

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,430
but but like that the seven year ago

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,890
version of it so trying to tell people

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,260
that monitoring CPU and disk is

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,720
pointless and monitoring metrics and

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,520
application is much much better at the

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,990
time i was doing job essentially this

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,680
was a long talk about jmx

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,140
and and these are you guys in 2009 so

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,880
thank you for being here and it's not

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,010
the same guys actually so it seems like

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,970
a different crowd came to listen that

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,350
here then we have 2010 and nothing much

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,080
changed here except for the fact that

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,780
nagios is now slowly moving downwards in

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,460
the logo and soon to disappear so I'm

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,190
guessing here they've sort of started to

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,950
work the icinga code somewhere deep in a

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,160
basement somewhere and and the sort of

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,110
on the way to to moving away from it but

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,060
I did a talk about essentially nothing

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,560
or as someone said a lot of vapor where

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,750
now the interesting bit about this

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,660
presentation is that it says here what's

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,120
coming Oh 39 and whenever someone is

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,910
using Anna's client 039 I tell them it's

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,710
10 years old please stop but if you do

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,440
the math if it says what's coming 039

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,620
then it was probably out in 2011 which

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,910
means that it's not even four years old

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,290
so maybe I should stop telling people

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,910
that and here we have you guys again and

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,770
here I've sort of moved room as well so

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,070
now I'm in this room which I've been in

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,680
sense 2011 was probably the most

00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,960
interesting year for me and the reason

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,960
was not just that Skyrim came out but

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,210
that I talked about skyrim coming out in

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,340
my monitoring presentation because

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,680
essentially what I realized is that no

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,150
one cares about monitoring anyway so why

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,920
talk about it you can just talk about

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,790
other random stuff and people will be

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,790
you know just as happy the talk i did

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,950
was about distributed monitoring and in

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,860
essence they will just you know Anna's

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,900
client but with a different title and

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,760
apparently some weird dude was doing

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,910
standing ovations yeah i assume he's

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,770
paid by net ways to do that but someone

00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,900
has to be that as well and and then we

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,880
have 2012 which which I want to

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,910
apologize again for the horrible font I

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,220
seriously don't know what I was thinking

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:50,290
it's like completely unreadable and some

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,510
sort of like read this down here so it

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,370
should look like yeah I wouldn't want to

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,890
go there but the interesting thing here

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,810
is really that my slides have changed

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,460
quite a lot because the previous ones

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,650
were like PowerPoint one and one with

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,620
bullet points and a standard PowerPoint

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,510
theme whereas all

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,820
sudden we had these full pictures lines

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,320
and if there's anything I want you to

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,779
take with you from this presentation is

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,390
that this is the way to do presentations

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,370
because people think what you're saying

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,320
makes more sense if there's a big

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,810
picture in the background and they think

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,990
you know what you're talking about which

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,310
I don't but that's never stopped me now

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,020
the interesting bit here is this guy

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,260
because this is actually the very first

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,940
Lego slide and it's in 2012 so the whole

00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,370
leg of theme is not very old for me

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,650
actually and this case have stolen it

00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,930
and then a little did a lot of demos

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,550
which I'm going to do today as well and

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,950
this is probably what we'll see later on

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,980
because thus for nothing has been going

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:49,550
well for me and this is how you guys

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,279
looked in 2012 by the way for some real

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,010
reason the photo from 2012 is missing

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,440
not sure if that is because I was wasted

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:00,589
at the evening event or if it is because

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,500
I didn't take a picture but I lost this

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,300
it's missing so this brings us to where

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,220
I think my presentation sort of came

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,839
together and I started to do the whole

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,400
full page slide and all that kind of

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,959
stuff and as you can see there is no

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,290
mention of Nagas anywhere in the logo

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:17,480
it's just osm scene right and I talked

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,890
about you know Anna's client what's new

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,570
essentially that's I had two

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,970
presentations one is talking about

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,290
metrics or doing application monitoring

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,510
and the other one is talking about

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,630
Dennis client so every other year to

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,930
sort of shift between them and this is

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,580
the way you guys looked and at 2014

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,920
which was last year which was again when

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,750
i did the rerun of my 20 2009

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,390
presentation why we should monitor

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,070
things a lot of people sort of said yeah

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,779
you have a lot of leg of slides and and

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,150
this is actually not true because there

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,290
were just a handful of them but but

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,959
those were the ones that people

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,190
remembered so that's a good thing now

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,630
the interesting thing about this

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,310
presentation is actually this picture

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,070
because in the corner this guy going

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,420
like oh please go away from here and and

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,050
then you have Chris sitting really

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,580
grumpily looking like one and and then

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,440
there is the Norwegian guys like what

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,040
the is he talking about I don't

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,200
it's like I don't get it so apparently

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,630
this was not a very good presentation

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,760
and for those of you who are wondering

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,350
and you've already seen these slides I

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,420
haven't forgot

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,790
about the rock store year 2013 when they

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,790
had a limo for me and the Swedish flags

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,170
it was awesome you know net waste is the

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,200
only company that will ever do something

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,360
like this for me don't know why but

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,480
apparently they're very kind or or

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,800
insane you might go with either way but

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,450
in essence what I mean trying to say

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,490
here is thank you to open source

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,800
monitoring conference it has literally

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,530
changed my life it is the best

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,940
conference in the world both because I

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,000
get to come here and talk about random

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,800
 but but also because it's it's

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,980
actually a fun conference and they

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,660
actually do a lot of cool stuff but but

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,520
the real thing which I think we should

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,170
be saying here is thank you to Nanette

00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,380
ways employees because they are the ones

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,090
to make this happen and not burned and

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,740
you know the guys who are standing there

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,660
talking to you the eyelets the other

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,340
guys with you know the black t-shirt and

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,050
the net ways logo so what I think

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,750
everyone should do here is once you get

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,990
outside go find the nearest net waste

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,730
guy or girl and give him a hug and say

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,240
thank you from the bottom of my heart

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,120
that would be awesome and and with that

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,630
I would like to say I'm I'm sorry again

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,390
for essentially wasting ten minutes of

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,860
your time with nonsense but but that's

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,950
what you get when you're the presenter

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,930
and you're allowed to do anything then

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,620
then I would also like to say sorry to

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,800
the guy or girl in room 505 do we have

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,330
anyone staying in 505 here by the way no

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,550
because when I arrived at the hotel I

00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,250
was staying in room 505 and there was no

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,050
Wi-Fi reception none whatsoever so I

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,300
went down to the desk and traded my room

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,160
for someone else's so there is a very

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,670
supports or somewhere without Wi-Fi

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,950
reception just because of me right and

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,800
and since I am on this sort of i'm sorry

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,840
track I I debated quite long whether or

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,300
not to do this but at the end of the day

00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,010
I felt you had to do something because a

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,510
lot of at least my monitor or the

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,310
monitoring community comes out of France

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,970
and then there is some weird stuff going

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:21,460
on there but I usually sort of try to

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,230
stay out of politics and with that i'm

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,570
actually going to try to sort of do the

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,980
presentation thing which i should have

00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,089
started about 10 15 minutes ago and this

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,459
is sort of

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,949
a truth with modification as we say in

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,629
Sweden because first of all I always

00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,389
want to say I'm I'm you know please

00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:42,040
don't be angry with me and the reason is

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,809
the same as always these are essentially

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,129
as copied slide from last year when I

00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,620
copied them from the year before and

00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,360
that kind of thing right so in essence

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,939
you know sometimes I'm basically this is

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,910
an open source project and sometimes

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:56,889
there's more time than than others but

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,040
we do have sponsoring and we do have

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,389
donations and we do have support if you

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,600
want to give me money for something that

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:07,779
is normally free I'm all for it I like

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,100
money and unfortunately not many people

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,559
like giving me money import from the

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,999
Norwegians and unfortunately there is

00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,339
only one Norwegian guy here since

00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:17,170
doesn't really pan out both well but as

00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,540
always thank to my sponsors without them

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,939
and this would or ennis client would not

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,850
be and I know you're all thinking you

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,110
know stop stalling and and the reason

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,110
I'm stalling if you haven't noticed

00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:31,629
because I wanted to do a really nice

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,490
presentation about Anna's client and and

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,410
then I hadn't finished anything to talk

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,199
about so I had to sort of do that on the

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,879
plane down here I think the word we're

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,179
looking for when we describe this by the

00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,819
way is CDD that stands for conference

00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:48,790
driven development and in essence it

00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:50,709
looks a bit like this so here we have

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,790
you know the beginning of the year when

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:53,800
you're lucky I'm going to do a lot of

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,509
cool stuff this year and then life

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,889
catches up with you and then there's a

00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,059
bit of vacation when you actually have

00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,220
some time to do some of the cool stuff

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:01,569
and then life catches up with you and

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,249
then your old there's a conference

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:07,149
soon and then there's like oh there

00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:09,399
is really a conference coming and and

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,679
unfortunately we're we're still you know

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,329
at the peak here so the commits for the

00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,600
stiff I'm going to demo or the release

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:18,639
was actually done this morning and

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,899
that's just super awesome because it

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,819
never pans out unfortunately so the

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,290
first thing oh yeah this was working

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,240
right the first thing we need to talk

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,949
about these versions because there is a

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,199
whole bunch of versions of NS client

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,779
currently and the main one is of course

00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,519
0 for 3 and for those of you are

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,110
wondering the three there is the major

00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,509
version number so the four is just sort

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,269
of an accident and the reason why we are

00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:45,010
at the 4 and not still at 0 3 14 or

00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:47,020
something is because before I used

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,150
word falls by name and if you go from

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,700
nine to ten they don't sort by name

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,900
anymore so I had to sort of change the

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,960
other number to get them to sort

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,090
correctly so that's why weirdo for an 0

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,610
for 3 is as I said the latest version

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,890
then we will get 0 for 4 in a couple of

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:05,440
days the plan was to get it out now but

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,240
unfortunately Wi-Fi doesn't work here or

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,850
well it works a little bit better but I

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,640
can't upload so when I get back I'll

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,430
probably push out 0 for 4 and then there

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,420
is this Oh 50 which is the mythical

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,250
major next version thing right and this

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,760
is actually what has been called over

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,470
for for quite some time and the all the

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,060
stuff I more much of the stuff I'm

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,560
talking about today will be about Oh 50

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,020
and that is i would say about eighty

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,120
percent complete so i hope it will be

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,500
out this year I just need to fix all the

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,510
bugs that's essentially what I'm in

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,130
doing which was awesome because I had a

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,590
workshop yesterday and then I had like

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:46,450
13 people finding bugs for me that's

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,310
super awesome right so installation is

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,320
something that is a problem for a lot of

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,780
people for some reason I haven't been

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,280
able to discern and installation in

00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,020
Windows is quite simple because you have

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,340
an msi you double click on it and you do

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,780
next next next next next thing you're

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,250
done right for for some reason uniques

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,480
people they don't like to click next

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,579
next next next next they want to do

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,010
complicated script you know PS exact

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,560
copying file running weird commands and

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,720
that kind of stuff and and that's not

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,329
the way to do it the way to do it is to

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,190
use the MSI and we're going to go into a

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,530
little bit about details about that but

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:23,290
in 0 for 4 and 0 50 there's something

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,320
called tools and tools are essentially

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,060
way to sort of seed a tool specific

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,060
configuration when we install on his

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,250
client the only one currently is Oh p5

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,290
so if you're using o p5 monitoring and

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,000
install in this client or NS client

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,470
pause pause it will allow you to click

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,180
the OPA five button and all of a sudden

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,910
it will look like an Opie 5 monitoring

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,440
agent and my hope is that other people

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,210
who are mean well with other monitoring

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,460
tools will supply me with their

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,110
preferred configuration and thus make it

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,250
easier and user to get use and its

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,710
client with you know whatever tool

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,180
you're using so the idea is to once you

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,250
fire up the install you'll be able to

00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,630
sort of selective it's a single nagios

00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,620
or oppa fibernet

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,780
or you know whatever tool you're using

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,590
and everything will sort of be sent off

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:08,470
correctly and and since I'm using this

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:11,170
on github the idea is that then the

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,120
other people can do pull requests and

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,560
change your own configuration quite

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,930
easily and I just sort of rebuild and

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,210
push new version so hopefully this will

00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,580
pan out the other new thing is something

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,800
called conf includes and these are

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,870
parameters which you can set on the

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,690
command line when you're running the MSI

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,750
or installing the MSI and in this case

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,860
conf includes will allow you to include

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,480
third-party files so if you have your

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,280
own configuration file for your

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,530
corporation you can just make sure that

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,720
that file is at the other end when you

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,340
install it and then you can in the MSI

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,870
installer head say tell hey and its

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,510
client income use this configuration

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,430
file as well and then we have something

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,350
called comp set and that's essentially

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,200
for setting random configuration keys

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,880
and this is probably not the way to go

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,800
if you want to tailor your own custom

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,170
configuration because you will end up

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,300
with a very very very long command line

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,560
and that's never a good thing especially

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,660
not in windows and such they have

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,310
limitations on command line length but

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,320
if you want to sort of tweak the odd

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,210
value here and there this is definitely

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,010
the way to go so in essence what I'm

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,630
trying to say is if this is not the way

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,150
you're installing in its clients plus

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,100
plus you're doing it wrong and there is

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,440
a whole bunch of these commands which

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,730
you can put on the command line and

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,920
customize how and his client boss boss

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,110
is being installed and as I said this is

00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,330
the way to do it all these weird scripts

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,190
you have you know with that PS exact and

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,160
copying and all that kind of stuff it's

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,290
wrong don't do it that way and this

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,690
brings us to the next important

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:41,640
cornerstone if you will avenge client

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:45,670
and that is queries queries are powerful

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,170
but they do have sensible defaults and

00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,510
they look something along the lines of

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:52,450
this and the idea here is that a lot of

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,340
the nagios or I singer or whatever

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,530
scripts you're having tend to have like

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,270
minus V and minus C and minus all these

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,550
stuff and if you go back to that

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,170
configuration and you try to read it you

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,120
will have no idea what is doing because

00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,160
minus V could be one thing in one script

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,780
and another thing in another scripts so

00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,270
the idea here is that these should be

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,190
easy to read and easy to understand so

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,490
that once you see it you'll say okay so

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,690
we're

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,790
checking if the load is about eighty

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,320
percent right I can sort of grab that

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,790
without having to read the documentation

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:25,050
and it's the same everywhere right so

00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:29,080
easy to read is the main sort of focus

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:31,510
things like exe equals chrome or things

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,890
like free is twenty five percent or

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,110
something that but the cool thing here

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:37,120
is that if you can sort of stack these

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:39,580
and make them infinitely complicated and

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,350
I have this example I think two years

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,760
ago where there's this guy is written

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,370
the filter that's like five pages long

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,780
and I'm not saying that's the way to go

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,580
but the cool thing here is that you can

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,190
actually make complicated queries and

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,360
you can actually check whatever you want

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,830
the other thing about queries that you

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,900
should know about is that there is a few

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,600
more than check CPU so if you're just

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,090
using check CPU and check disk again

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,650
you're doing it wrong so look at the

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,500
other queer said there they can do a lot

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,890
of stuff for you and change or make your

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:13,750
life simpler and this brings us to a

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:15,880
wonderful world of metrics metrics is

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,530
essentially all the rave nowadays so I

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,309
figured out how to jump on the bandwagon

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:24,130
and do it like everyone else in essence

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:26,920
metrics is something that fetches data

00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,320
every X seconds so you might think of

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,210
them as the opposite of checks because a

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,010
lot of people when they handle metrics

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,720
with nagios or something like that what

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,640
they do is they run a check fetch

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,590
performance data type the performance

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,179
data to some sort of graphing database

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,860
or something like that then they run a

00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,540
check on that and then you're a bit like

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,330
what I did has start to go through now

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,950
yes so the idea here is that instead of

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,630
you know doing all of these checks we

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,460
can just push the matrix to your data

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,690
store and you can graph them there and

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,400
you can check them in the data store

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,540
doing all complicated aggregates and all

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,910
that kind of stuff right so this is I

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,070
think another interesting aspect of

00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:04,390
metrics that a lot of or a lot current

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,000
leaders three of them but there will be

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,410
more quite soon a lot of the internals

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,720
of an excellent post boss will be

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,550
exposed as matrix so you will be able to

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,559
see what n is Klaus boss is actually

00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,120
doing so you can see you know how many

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,620
threads is using and for what and

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,690
connections and errors in a lot kind of

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,120
stuff so you will be able to sort of

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,340
monitor and his client plusbus quite

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,890
deeply using these metrics

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,720
right so where can you send these

00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,460
metrics done well graphite is the

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,950
obvious easy choice and that's been

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,210
available for quite some time

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,950
essentially for sending off performance

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,350
data but with metrics you can just send

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,360
the raw date as well but we also support

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,180
collect d for those who are using that

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,800
and there is something planned for doing

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,720
checks on these metrics and then you're

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,840
thinking what wasn't the whole point of

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,490
metrics to not do checks yes but it

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,250
would be kind of cool if you could do

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:58,880
checks that were on dis burying things

00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:02,030
so you could do checks on oh wait sorry

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,760
on like two pictures ahead so you could

00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,500
do checks on cpu and memory at the same

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,540
time which are currently impossible

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,740
without some serious shoehorning or

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,120
doing some scripts or something like

00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,890
that so this is something that is

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,740
planned so it's not implemented but some

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,910
sort of easy way to do checks on all of

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,670
these metrics which we have collected

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,140
internally the way metrics looks

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,610
currently something along the lines of

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,470
this you just have a key and a value

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,930
pretty much like it does in the graphite

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,750
world or in any other world right the

00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:35,660
other new thing in 0 for 3 as well as 0

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,850
for 4 and 0 50 is the web interface in

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,400
the next version 0 50 it is actually

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,140
much better when I release the web

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,080
interface last year I said it was the

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,910
awesomest thing ever and I still think

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,590
that so when I spent you know better

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,840
part of the summer rewriting it to

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,790
making it even more awesome I thought

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,030
like wow this is going to be awesome and

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,190
and then some guy sent me oh I look this

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:03,200
reviewable web interface and it sucks I

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,460
was like yay happy but I think it's a

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,600
bit on where you're coming from you know

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,550
I'm coming from a really crappy

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,040
command-line interface and then a web

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,180
interface is way better but most people

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,770
might be coming from something like

00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,830
Facebook or something that actually

00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,260
works and then my interface is not way

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:20,060
better and so I think you know maybe I

00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,710
need to tone down the awesomeness or the

00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,450
web interface but I still think it's

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,370
awesome and and it's it's yeah I like it

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,630
some people don't but I've fixed most of

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,170
the stuff he complain about actually

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,220
sell so it will be awesome soon maybe

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,990
the other new thing in the web interface

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,730
is something called templates and

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,820
templates it might be a bad name but

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:44,370
it's sort of a way for a script or a

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,290
module to provide its own web-based

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,000
configuration interface and we'll see

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,919
this vet in detail later on but in

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,840
essence currently when you're changing

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,059
the configuration you have this key

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,130
value store with a hierarchical path

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,840
structure and that's not very intuitive

00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,700
if you're going to set a value you might

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
want to have a list of options or

00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,750
something like that and this is a way

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,309
for scripts and four modules to provide

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,919
that so that they will be easily to

00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:10,049
configure the other thing and this is

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,910
also the yellow stuff is things I'm

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,620
added in the last few days the green

00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,600
stuff is thinks that's there and read

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,270
stuff for things that I haven't added

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,340
yet but might do on the plane back the

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,230
other thing that's coming is check n SCP

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:26,460
which will be using the rest interface

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,890
of the web UI to make checks and I think

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,690
this will make it easier to do

00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:33,510
firewalling and sort of Saturn is

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,840
clients what + + up in complicated

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,549
network scenarios this is an example of

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,900
a template so here when we add the

00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:41,820
counter we get a list of available

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,520
counter which makes it a lot easier to

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,340
find out what your counter is called at

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,669
least sometimes and this brings us to

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,890
the demo which yeah it's not so off time

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,559
actually oh yeah sorry I actually have a

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,330
few slides before the demo is anyone

00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:02,250
here using docker no one is using docker

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,320
wow that's the first time I've heard

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,570
that one I thought everyone was using

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,860
docker I'm using docker and and

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,140
essentially what i'm trying to say here

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,910
is a darker really really sucks and I'm

00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,010
probably the only person in the world

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,590
who feel that way because everyone else

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,940
seems to think that it's awesome but in

00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,350
essence what I'm trying to say is you

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,250
know I'm not kidding here you know it

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,750
sucks so bad that I I you know I had

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,330
there been a guy from dr. here I might I

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,830
might actually hit him and that the

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,620
reason the reason is I've spent

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,299
countless of hours trying to get dr. to

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,700
run on Windows and then you run into

00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:40,650
this guy and you're like yay ok so

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,840
there's apparently something wrong thank

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,190
you and then you say ok let's just

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,660
restart everything you know if you

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,669
delete all your virtual machines you

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,549
restart everything and you run into this

00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:52,380
guy and down here at the bottom you get

00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,530
some sort of like yeah it's the line in

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,900
the

00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,250
c++ were some fee it's like not even an

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,190
error message it's like what the

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,450
happened I don't know and and this is

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,100
what you get and then you're thinking

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,380
okay so what did you actually do before

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,240
this because it was working before and

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,430
then you cover the lid on your laptop

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,960
put it in a bag and then you go to work

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,120
you open it up and then your network

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,730
interface has somehow changed and this

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,910
then you get this so in essence darker

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,070
on windows no it's not possible at least

00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:24,690
not for me but hopefully someone else

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:28,020
can tell me that it's right so demo time

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,270
and now we're gonna actually show you

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,850
let's see duplicate is what we want

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:36,600
Anna's client and the first thing we're

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:39,150
gonna do if we go here and here is

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,470
install and its client and I I'm not

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,840
going to type because does she is going

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,520
to end up as a big accident but but now

00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,380
we're installing and his client and

00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,060
we're telling it that it can change the

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,830
configuration we're telling it to enable

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,570
the web interface and we're setting the

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,540
password to hello because that's a nice

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,270
password and we're just running this

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,820
command unfortunately MSI's asynchronous

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,860
so it is doing stuff in the background

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,880
hopefully it will pan out let's just

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:08,760
close this and this and see if we have

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,190
something running on our local host yes

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,250
we get this by the way because it's a

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,380
self-signed certificate so so yes it is

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,800
not secure or it's not private or

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,080
whatever they're thinking and this is

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,030
the way the web interface looks and if

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,680
you for some reason have forgotten the

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,200
password you can run this command to

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,830
display it if I can copy paste correct

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,230
no apparently I can't that's how we

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,070
can't be pasted so if we go to our

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:40,170
command line here in this line folder

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:44,850
and we run this it should hopefully say

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:46,350
that the password is hello awesome you

00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,110
can also change the password via the

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,600
same come at lunch so if we do this this

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,100
by the way is a bug that it's red so

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,030
just ignore what I'm doing right now

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,590
right so and here we have some metrics

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,260
being collected and as a they look like

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,570
a tree not very fancy if we go to the

00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,270
CPU tab this is how it looks and here we

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,960
have the cpu utilization we have sort of

00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,549
like handle

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,179
and processes and threads not kind of

00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:14,039
stuff if we go to the memory tab we will

00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,570
see the memory utilization and the

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,710
reason why I'm using a lot of memories

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,990
because I have virtual machines running

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,460
normally it's at ninety percent or

00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,860
something like that because I have a lot

00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,020
of virtual machines running and then we

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,450
can see this utilization and this is

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,309
again it's not how folded this is this

00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:34,049
is the i/o utilization of disk or the

00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:36,299
read q and that comes off right so not

00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,039
very fancy but I think it's a step up

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:39,600
from the previous command line we had

00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,330
which was essentially a black box with a

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,880
lot of weird messages in it and then we

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,890
can go to the modules tab and this takes

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,779
a few seconds the first time because it

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,330
needs to load all the modules to figure

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,750
out what modules we have and here we can

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,490
essentially just load so if we want to

00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:01,380
load event log we owe sore levels

00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:04,260
already loaded what else do we have that

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,179
was also loaded oh wait that's the

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,130
backspace I should have actually

00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,830
prepared them let's load check log file

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,419
on and we can just click this this box

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,490
at the beginning is that the module is

00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,679
loaded that means that it is now inside

00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,450
and this client and we can use it the

00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,669
green box over here is that the model is

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,279
enabled this means that if I'm I started

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,649
sorry please here can you make it a

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,020
little bit bigger so that it's easier to

00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:29,220
read it from the yeah from this is

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,789
actually mobile enables like make it

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,850
really big and and we at the hamburger

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:38,940
menu let's leave it there somewhere is

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,460
that readable yeah so this green guy on

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,899
this side means that it is enabled this

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,700
means that if i restart and his client

00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,950
plus balls it will be available next

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,990
time so check log file for instance it's

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,120
just loaded so I can use it but it's not

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,370
enabled if I want to enable this I can

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,169
click this guy what happens now is that

00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:58,799
have changed my configuration and that

00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:00,750
pops up here and then we can save the

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,039
configuration and if we don't want to

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,090
save your configuration we can say that

00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,580
it should always save the configuration

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:07,380
and then we can reload in this client

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:11,700
and the module will now be saved and

00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:14,970
always there forever right that's for

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,799
nothing spectacular so let's see what we

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,049
have else probably should have prepared

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,519
yeah let's go to the Settings tab this

00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,950
is where we have our

00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,869
key-value stores of our settings and as

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:26,039
I said before it's not very intuitive if

00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:27,330
you go to this guy you have a whole

00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,859
bunch of keys you still get the

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,570
description and you get the values and

00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,459
all that kind of stuff the greyed out

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,529
part by the way means I haven't changed

00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:36,719
these values if I were to change this

00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:38,070
value to you know 0 then it will turn

00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:42,149
black and I'll see that it's can change

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:45,419
right can I can click here not to change

00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:47,700
something and let's see what else if we

00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:50,700
go to this tab we can see which values

00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,259
we have changed so the changed tab means

00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,359
that these all the values in this

00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:56,669
section I have changed touched in some

00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,619
way we also have basic which is the

00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,239
commonly set values and advanced which

00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:02,429
are there not so commonly set values

00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:05,700
allowed hast by the way should not be

00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:08,399
here that's a bug yeah I sell them built

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,839
this this morning so there are a few

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,659
loose edges currently so this brings us

00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,059
to for instance counters because I said

00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,950
before if you want to add a counter you

00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,200
can go here and you can click the add

00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,299
new and it will allow you to add all the

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,429
keys which is not very intuitive what is

00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,049
new is these templates and if we click

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:32,190
the add new template it will look like

00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:35,489
this so here we can for instance call

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,229
our template something and if we start

00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:38,669
to type here we will just get a list of

00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:40,829
all performance counters on this machine

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,869
now I'm not going to use that list

00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:46,440
actually because I'm gonna show you

00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:47,789
something else because one problem with

00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,279
using performance counters is that they

00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:52,649
are localized so if you're a German

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,049
machine as you can see here these guys

00:32:52,649 --> 00:32:57,329
are in Swedish rights or well maybe can

00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,759
see if it had been slightly bigger if we

00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:01,829
do like this you will be able to see and

00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,599
if you don't speak Swedish that might be

00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:05,399
difficult for you to set up right and if

00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,379
you don't speak German which i do then

00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,609
it's difficult for me when I get here so

00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:10,679
what you can use is use the English

00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:13,109
counter names and they will also

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,419
magically work because of new features

00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:17,159
in the performance data and the other

00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,759
thing we're going to do is click the

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,909
instances thing and set the value yeah

00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,589
let's do static as well or D means that

00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,659
we will be capturing the value over time

00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:29,399
and giving you an average here we're

00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,679
just grabbing the latest value because

00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:35,480
otherwise in one fluctuates unless it'll

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,730
be kind of static and save this

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,570
yeah I think we don't go from the save

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,070
dialog so hopefully its here anyway and

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,510
we already saved the configuration

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:49,170
because it's always save and then we can

00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:52,500
just reload and if God is willing we

00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,450
will have yes new metrics awesome this

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,430
wasn't working last night by the way so

00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:00,890
here we have our new network interface

00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:06,410
and their values apparently not so much

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:12,570
so apparently it's not working service

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:15,330
restart let's do that yeah I I brilliant

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,220
you came to the idea on Monday that old

00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,590
Sunday that let's change the internal

00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,050
threading mechanisms and that's going to

00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,840
pan out really well it didn't so there

00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:27,360
are some snacks in that code now let's

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,370
see if we have some new values for the

00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,340
network yes so here we can see the value

00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,950
is updating and now we talked about

00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,600
these values because currently we can

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,790
see the main web interface and that's

00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,710
not very interesting so something that

00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,770
might be slightly more interesting is if

00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:47,220
we go to let's filter instead is quicker

00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:50,340
the graphite client and then we can in

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,660
load that and then we can go to the

00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,280
Settings tab and we will have our

00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,650
default machine and we sat at the local

00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:02,910
host which in my case is a virtual

00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:04,590
machine and then we say that and does it

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,620
actually say anything when I save it no

00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:11,220
maybe not okay no we've already saved

00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,990
them so let's reload and again if things

00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,330
work out we will be able to get some new

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:21,420
metrics in here hopefully yes it is

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:24,980
working out awesome so here we can see

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:29,640
the metrics we added sometimes I'm lucky

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:33,000
if not malice knees working oh sorry and

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,180
click their own one so down here

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,610
somewhere we will have this nice metric

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,910
which we just added was it this one yeah

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,440
so this is kind of how metrics work and

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,810
it's quite easy to set them up if you're

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,400
using collected will work similarly the

00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,150
only problem with collectives that is

00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,490
multicast

00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,020
which is a pain to set up especially if

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,500
you're on localhost which is watching

00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,260
you use it doing this with graphite so

00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,900
metrics kind of easy to set up works

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,339
kind of okay templates are not available

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,270
everywhere they're just available when

00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:10,200
they make sense by the way if we go to a

00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:12,059
model like system and queries we have a

00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,829
list of all the queries it provides all

00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,079
of these without on the score by the way

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:19,200
or legacy so you probably shouldn't be

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,000
using them they are for old people and I

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,640
don't been retired people I mean old

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,950
people if we go to something for

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,460
instance like check CPU we can run that

00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:32,849
query by clicking run and we will get

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,529
the performance data back now the

00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,630
interesting bit here is that this is the

00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:38,250
simple defaults kicking in there is no

00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,140
command lines there's no options there's

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,839
no anything it is just running check CPU

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:47,839
but if we want we can for instance set

00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:52,980
the filter oh sorry it's not tab the

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,839
filter to none and we will get the load

00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,510
for all core for each individual core in

00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:59,789
this list is done so then you're

00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,650
wondering okay so how do I know what the

00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,940
command it is actually running and then

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:08,339
you can run something called show

00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:10,650
defaults and if we run this we will get

00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:17,880
the command it's actually running back

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:19,470
oh wait sorry I need click enter so here

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,260
so here we can see that the default

00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:25,020
filter is core equals total meaning that

00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,880
we just want to get the total cpu load

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,260
and not individual course but we can

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,390
also see that the default warning level

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,420
is eighty percent and if I make this

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,700
bigger again here default level is

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:40,190
eighty percent the critical is ninety

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:43,109
percent and so on and so forth and so

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:45,059
that's I think kind of neat and it makes

00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,609
it quite easy if we go to the help tab

00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:49,890
we can get a help and this is not pretty

00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,660
by the way so the list of options we

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,849
have is just a list it's not like a

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,460
prettily formatted list I'll fix that

00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:59,309
someday if we go to the documentation

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,560
which by the way actually exists even

00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:06,480
though people seem to think it doesn't

00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:10,200
we owe to cpu click check query and see

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,740
if we have filter we get a slightly

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:18,420
nicer looking list where we oh yeah this

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,490
was apparently not mobile enabled and

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,840
here we can see what kind of keywords we

00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:26,040
have available to us when we write our

00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,780
filters or something like that right so

00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,310
that sort of brings us to the last part

00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,340
that I'm going to demo and that is the

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:35,040
console view and the console view is

00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,050
kind of the replacement for the test

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,730
client which we had before so here I

00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,770
came for instance type help and I will

00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:43,440
get a list of commands so I can run I

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:46,590
can run check cpu and i will get check

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,030
cpu matrix back but i can also do things

00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:52,770
like load check or cause crashes maybe

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:56,520
don't know now i don't think that

00:38:52,770 --> 00:39:00,950
installed let's do like this plugins and

00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:07,440
see what we have we can load and rpe

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:10,650
client and a lot of stuff like that so

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,630
this sort of replaces the test command

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,280
line client as we discovered yesterday

00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,800
there are a couple of things that

00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,060
doesn't work there as expected but those

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,660
will hopefully be fixed in the near

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,490
future but the big difference between

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,380
the web interface and running in test

00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,900
mode is that when you run in test mode

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:33,840
it automatically sets the log level so

00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:37,680
if I were to go here and service stop no

00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,600
sorry I can't spell and as CP and then

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,240
run and SCP in test mode it will just

00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,710
spew out logs at me and you will not get

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,840
out automatically in the web interface

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,520
you can they'll go and change the log

00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,860
level and reload and then you will get

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,960
it in the web interface but there are

00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,850
still some things that are not magic in

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,230
the web interface that might be on the

00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:00,360
command line so yes I might also say

00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,760
that there is like help links here and

00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,590
stuff like that so we have candles

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,190
standard stuff so hopefully it should be

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:10,200
a bit easier to use on this point and

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,180
now I'm gonna sort of switch back to my

00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,410
presentation because hopefully I'm out

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,089
of time I don't really know when I

00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:23,930
should be ending butts

00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:28,880
hopefully about now let's see this no no

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:34,259
now the keyboards not working seriously

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,150
hello shift up fam oh there we are and

00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,799
again I would like to say I'm really

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,079
really sorry for not having a better

00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:41,910
presentation this year as I said I've

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,700
been way too busy with other stuff I'll

00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:46,529
promise you next year more Lego slides

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,190
and something that actually makes sense

00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:51,869
now you had more of a half-assed demo

00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:54,299
and with that I sort of want to say you

00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:56,400
know thank you for listening but before

00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:58,680
that I want to say don't forget to thank

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,499
not waste and don't forget to hoggy I
