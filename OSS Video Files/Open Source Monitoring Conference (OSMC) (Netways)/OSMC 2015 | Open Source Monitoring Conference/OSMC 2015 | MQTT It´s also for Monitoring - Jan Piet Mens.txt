Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Elastic virtualization using the popular OpenStack platform is for real. While Sysadmins and DevOps professionals fully embrace these new developments, managing them is still a challenge. Adding layers of abstraction for compute, network and storage resources further increases complexity. Resource sharing, the fully dynamic creation of networks, virtual machines and recently Linux containers inside the framework also increases the challenge of managing these already complex systems.

This presentation will provide insights on how to optimize the monitoring and management of OpenStack "from the bottom up", and from front to back to efficiently manage and troubleshoot OpenStack environments using API monitoring techniques and best of breed OpenSource tools such as Icinga 2.4, OpenStack API, Fuel, BoxSpy, OpenTSDB and others.
