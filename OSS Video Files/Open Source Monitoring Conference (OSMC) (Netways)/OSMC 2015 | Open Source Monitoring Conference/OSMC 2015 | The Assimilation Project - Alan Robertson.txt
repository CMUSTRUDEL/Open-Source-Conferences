Title: OSMC 2015 | The Assimilation Project - Alan Robertson

Description: 
	The open source Assimilation Project provides continuous integrated IT discovery and monitoring aimed at risk management and mitigation. It discovers systems, switches, services and dependencies and detailed configuration information. Our discovery uses agents which run local commands, listens to packets without network privileges, and create and update a graph-based configuration management database (CMDB) of your infrastructure and services without setting off security alarms. This CMDB includes services you aren’t monitoring and systems you’ve forgotten about. This is important since about 30% of outsider security breaches come through forgotten systems, and services you’re not monitoring can’t be properly managed. Monitoring is extremely scalable due to its radically distributed architecture. Because discovery informs monitoring, most monitoring doesn’t require any configuration.

Easily extensible discovery enables administrators to let the Assimilation software keep information they are interested in a central database and continually up to date instead of in ad hoc flat files.
This enables straightforward best practice audits (including security audits) without touching every machine. Our graph-based CMDB is natural for visualization and supports interesting queries about root causes and impact analysis. Our future work concentrates on continuous security monitoring - enabling you to easy stay in security compliance.

This talk gives an overview of the Assimilation project - its capabilities, scalability and architecture, future plans and includes a demo of zero-configuration discovery and monitoring.
