Title: OSMC 2015 | The Assimilation Project - Alan Robertson
Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The open source Assimilation Project provides continuous integrated IT discovery and monitoring aimed at risk management and mitigation. It discovers systems, switches, services and dependencies and detailed configuration information. Our discovery uses agents which run local commands, listens to packets without network privileges, and create and update a graph-based configuration management database (CMDB) of your infrastructure and services without setting off security alarms. This CMDB includes services you aren’t monitoring and systems you’ve forgotten about. This is important since about 30% of outsider security breaches come through forgotten systems, and services you’re not monitoring can’t be properly managed. Monitoring is extremely scalable due to its radically distributed architecture. Because discovery informs monitoring, most monitoring doesn’t require any configuration.

Easily extensible discovery enables administrators to let the Assimilation software keep information they are interested in a central database and continually up to date instead of in ad hoc flat files.
This enables straightforward best practice audits (including security audits) without touching every machine. Our graph-based CMDB is natural for visualization and supports interesting queries about root causes and impact analysis. Our future work concentrates on continuous security monitoring - enabling you to easy stay in security compliance.

This talk gives an overview of the Assimilation project - its capabilities, scalability and architecture, future plans and includes a demo of zero-configuration discovery and monitoring.

	00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,270
I'm passing around some network diagrams

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,040
which are like this big they're huge and

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:21,070
they're what they r is a diagram of the

00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,779
of a few machines at my house and we'll

00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,400
talk a little more about that that's

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,760
sort of produced by the software that

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,109
I'll he'll show you here right now if

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,779
you can hold it right side up this time

00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,519
he'll be good now you had it up he has

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:35,080
it right side up congratulations there's

00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:38,910
one over here too so we'll be passing

00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,500
them back through the audience here and

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,910
just too it's not so much that you can

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,380
understand everything on there but I

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,700
want you just want to make it clear that

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,120
everything on there was discovered

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,219
automatically now i'm told that that

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,050
they don't allow you to bring in rotten

00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,360
eggs and tomatoes like they used to

00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,320
because of the mess it makes so I'll

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,180
tell you what I'm going to do i'll give

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,539
you some so when the time comes you see

00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:06,729
you'll have some already 22 to pass out

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,460
so if i if i get saying something that's

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:12,130
too outrageous you know you'll know what

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,080
to do i oh they all went to the same

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:19,150
person there didn't they let me see if I

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:23,500
get you some to the back well anyway you

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,330
get the idea oh and in here I have

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,159
earplugs I guess this is must be for my

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,090
criticism I put them in and then I can't

00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,439
hear what you say actually I'm not sure

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,320
why they're in this bag I know why I

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:45,369
have them I think I get my bags mixed up

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:50,920
but ok please shut the doors so we can

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:54,759
start yeah I'd like you to introduce a

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:59,020
very funny guy Robertson two years ago

00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:04,659
here you go ahead a talk yes talk at the

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:11,650
mcd and this talk had to be awesome so

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:14,380
I'm very expected ok m and it's not

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,650
about linux HHA it's about the

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,540
simulation project when it is go ahead

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,630
yeah which is a lot more sophisticated

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,670
and way more interesting

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,500
and we'll do a demo which I was unable

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,210
to do the previous time because I wasn't

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,490
really ready for demos how many people

00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,470
here were heard my talk two years ago I

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,210
know a couple of you did every one and

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,770
only that and they all knew better than

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:41,520
to sit in the front where they get hit

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:42,960
by these missiles right so I guess I can

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,360
set this where I can see what I'm

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,510
supposed to be talking about right so

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:54,360
why is it showing me what anyway the me

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:58,650
see if I can make this show my notes or

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
not yeah that apparently works so i'll

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,270
be talking about the assimilation

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,950
project as he said and apparently though

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,060
that does that works there but it's not

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,490
doing the right thing here so i'll

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,140
switch back i'm not sure why it's I'll

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,230
guess I'll just look at these anyway

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,690
I've been an IT a long time 35-plus

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,060
years more than that really I have a guy

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,340
show up at a talk I gave the other day I

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,900
hadn't seen in over 30 years and he

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,470
actually came from Florida to Colorado

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,870
which is like two thousand two or three

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:31,020
thousand kilometers so I was really

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,000
surprised to see him so I founded the

00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,850
Linux h a project which has been you

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,520
know nowadays is called pacemaker you

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,290
might have also known at his heartbeat

00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:45,450
in 2010 I started this project and in

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:49,320
2013 I spoke here 2013 I spoke here not

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,260
long after i had started the company for

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,290
this I founded this product the company

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,959
that goes with this in 2013 I worked at

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,310
bell labs for 21 years for Souza for a

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,390
year until they let all their folks in

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,590
the u.s. go because we were all too

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:07,770
expensive and and and I worked for IBM

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,520
for about 13 years which is I had just

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,830
left IBM when I spoke here before this

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,340
was inspired by i'm not sure why I'm not

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,280
seeing mine or my slides here anyway

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,900
I'll just get what make sure i can stay

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,580
where I can see the slides so I know

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,580
what I'm supposed to say see it's here

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,890
on the slides I started this project i

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,240
started the idea for this project one is

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,220
working on a computer that had two

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,340
million cores 2.2 million cores and

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,080
slice

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,120
started thinking about scalability in a

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,120
different way I'm that may be surprised

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,740
you right when you start thinking about

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,750
a system has thirteen thousand blades

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,520
and every blade has a hundred and sixty

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,930
cores the exact number is 24 x 24 x 24 x

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,290
160 you know multiply that out right

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,580
that's 2.2 million course and i started

00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,650
making about scale in a different way

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,080
and started thinking about topology

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,910
because this particular computer it was

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,740
very very very important you understand

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,960
topology of it was a cube computer so

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,030
this is the kind of make you'll see the

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,490
influences of scale and topology

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,720
throughout this project and then I

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,700
started thinking about discovery because

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,470
if you wanted to deal with the topology

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,440
issues you had to yet either configure

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,150
the topology to discover it and so since

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,889
configuring things usually results in

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,510
the wrong answer you know like I

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,820
configured it wrong anybody who ever

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:32,160
configured anything wrong yeah me

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:34,320
neither so so we went to discovering the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,660
topology and you'll see that and then

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,699
pretty soon discovery became the primary

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,460
emphasis and the monitoring we started

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,729
out doing from the beginning became the

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,440
the side effect almost of the discovery

00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,600
and you'll see how that's happened and

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,590
how its evolved over time so this is

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,210
kind of what we're going to be doing

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,729
here we'll talk about the overview of

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,050
the the system management suite it's got

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,810
to tell it something so I call it a

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,370
system management sweet talk about

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,580
debate and I'm going to have to slow

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,110
down I tend to talk too fast I just

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,750
remembered that I'm speaking to an

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,430
audience we're not everyone's and very

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,340
few people are native English speakers

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,470
so you know if I get to talking too fast

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,470
I suppose you know an egg or tomato

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,930
would be in order but we'll talk about

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,760
the basic technology the best practice

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,530
analysis which is something we didn't

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,020
talk about before because I hadn't we

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,169
hadn't done this I'll do a demo which I

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,729
have not had not done here before and

00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,919
the current status and what it is you

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:35,419
need to do because I came here to get

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,530
you engaged that's why I'm here and

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,180
hopefully I've started out at least by

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,530
keeping you partially awake at least

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,960
those of you who got hit by those

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:46,050
missiles with no know that your what now

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,030
more awake than you were and what it is

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,200
I want you to do how you can get engaged

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,760
and involved here

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,730
of the things I will mention if we will

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,350
be doing a having a session that on the

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,480
assimilation project at the hackathon

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,950
and there are some things we can do here

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,500
that don't require being a you know a

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,000
really wonderful coder so if you want to

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,200
just come and discuss it some more i'm

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,960
good with that if you want to comment

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,760
and we'll do some other exercises

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,660
together if you know depending on who

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,090
shows up and what they're interested in

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,120
so there's some trends here which are

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,620
worth keeping in in in in mind here

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,080
which you probably are not familiar with

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,510
but you may have lived with first of all

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,760
thirty percent of all break-ins from the

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,290
outside when they come from the outside

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,240
and they hack your systems and they get

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,750
in thirty percent of them come through

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,120
systems people have lost track of either

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,610
they never knew where they were or they

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,470
never got registered properly or they

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,160
were an experiment which someone forgot

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:47,520
about all those different possibilities

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,320
right ninety percent of everyone and

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,970
these are this this set of statistics is

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,160
from people who runs puppet and chef

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,230
which means they're mostly leading-edge

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,490
type people ninety percent of those

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:02,880
people according to a survey by Turnbull

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,070
James Turnbull have had failures of

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,770
services that they were not monitoring

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,920
so the real world is probably worse than

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,420
that ninety percent is pretty high but

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,360
the real world is probably worse than

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,700
that eighty percent of people who get in

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,170
compliance like with PCI compliance find

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,110
that a year later that they're no longer

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,460
in compliance that they're not that that

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,960
they've gone to the trouble they've

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,730
gotten in compliance they've done all

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,540
this stuff and then they find that

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,040
they're unable to stay there if anyone

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,810
who's ever tried to get in compliance

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,380
with a bunch of security rules it's kind

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,300
of like eating an elephant you have to

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,520
do it one bite at a time it takes a long

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,940
time and at the end you have a very sick

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,310
feeling in your stomach but the problem

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,560
with this is is is you have to keep

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,540
doing it over and over again if you

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,370
don't stay in compliance it becomes an

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,870
annual event so you don't want that

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,150
thirty percent of the people on this

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,100
survey of leading-edge people admitted

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,700
they really only start monitoring things

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,860
after they

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,090
broken they don't really start

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,190
monitoring something until they

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,870
discovered it's broken now I know you

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,030
guys are all better than that and you

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,920
would never do that but the real world

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,900
is most likely worse than that when I've

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,390
asked people how many people think the

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,570
real world is better than this now I

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,280
didn't think so thirty percent of

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,280
systems aren't even doing anything

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,440
useful what they are the proper way to

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,480
understand the thermal modeling of a

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,680
data center is a room full of space

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
heaters that you turn on the air

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,990
conditioner to keep it from getting too

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,970
hot and so if you could turn off thirty

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,970
percent of those space heaters you could

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,410
save a huge amount of money I'm not you

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,030
know you know your air-conditioning bill

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,500
would go down you would save money you

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,350
would save the planet all these good

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,170
things and so the theme of all of this

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,110
is you cannot manage which you cannot

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,990
see these are all manifestations of

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,120
things people don't know that they don't

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,950
know what they are they can't see what

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,870
they are and you'll notice from that

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,870
graph you can see a lot of things about

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,960
my servers at home and honestly the

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,470
detail we collect today is 10 or 100

00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,690
times more data than shows on that graph

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,340
so these are things which are real which

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,360
really happen with people which we

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,560
address with this project Oh a couple

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,150
more three more things here which are

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,090
not so much statistical but they're

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,310
anecdotal largest sites have trouble

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,810
scaling their monitoring i know that i

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,160
think is new release one of the things

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,050
they try and address this scaling that's

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,520
because most most of the monitoring

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,440
products don't scale very well and

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,030
honestly I don't know of any product

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,360
that scales like we do and you'll see

00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:43,740
why I say that a hundred thousand

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,440
service is not at all out of range for

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,850
us and you'll see why and this is the

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,750
kind of claims I make that sometimes

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,430
result in eggs and tomatoes

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,840
documentation is larger site

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,160
administrators often don't know the

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,450
dependencies how many people in the room

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,320
think they know all the dependencies of

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:04,590
all the services and all the servers

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,330
yeah it doesn't think so and that that's

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,830
your server services and of course your

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,080
switches right so if you want to

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,670
continue on all those services and if

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,350
you look there there are there is

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,420
actually dependency information on that

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,470
graph which was all discovered for those

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,240
of you came in a little

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,400
later and the graphs got are getting

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,520
passed around everything on those graphs

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,830
was discovered with zero configuration I

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,000
didn't even tell it where the central

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,550
server was so anybody here think that a

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,080
documentation is complete in date and

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:40,500
cheap or any of the if no nobody thinks

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,000
that because it's not true document did

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,370
you know that there are in my view there

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,990
are three kinds of documentation you

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,690
have documentation which is incorrect

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,190
today oh don't notice I'm sorry the most

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,340
common kind of documentation is the

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,780
documentation which you do not have and

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,460
then there's the second kind of

00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,070
documentation is documentation which is

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,020
incorrect today and the third kind of

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:06,900
documentation which will be incorrect

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:08,400
tomorrow there is no fourth kind so this

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,130
is what happens when you have to

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,630
document things manually that we have

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,160
the opportunity with this project of

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,380
keeping up today of course we can't

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,930
document procedures for signing into the

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:24,410
data center but we can document anything

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,510
we can discover in our database right so

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,310
we try and provide insight with a lot of

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,110
ways what we do is provide insight and

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,410
then automation based on what we've

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,150
discovered we help you reduce errors all

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,620
these different things speed up problem

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,480
resolution because if you understand

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,400
your situation you can actually solve

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,160
problems faster than you can if you have

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,350
to discover everything by hand reduce

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,170
the documentation how many people are

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,020
for me with the term cmdb configuration

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,330
management database right so in a lot of

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,160
ways what we are is is a lot like a

00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,860
configuration management database except

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:04,560
our data is always correct because it's

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,080
discovered and kept up to date so what

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,420
we don't do is we cannot document the

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,360
things which we cannot discover but the

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,190
nice thing is you can rely on everything

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,950
that we have because we keep it

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,170
up-to-date and you'll see how we do that

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,580
we'll talk about that process we help

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,590
you automate monitoring enhance security

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,160
designed for extreme scale but it does

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:30,329
not wash your car or anything like that

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,309
so or toast your bread but it does does

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:34,619
in fact do these kinds of things and it

00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:35,999
does it the way that in addition to this

00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:38,100
well I think there's some other slides

00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,829
where I talk about this let's go on so

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,569
so in a lot of ways we think of it as

00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,759
for different products but it's really

00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:47,819
one product right but it carries four

00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,529
different areas we have the CMDB which

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,129
is sort of the overall database that

00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:55,290
drives everything else we have exception

00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,059
monitoring now this is not statistical

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,339
monitoring this is not Gravano type

00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:01,499
monitoring this is is it working is it

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:07,319
not working but in depth and in detail

00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:09,600
not just is the process of running we do

00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:11,369
discovery related to security which is

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,809
to say we can tell you whether you're in

00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:15,799
compliance and we tell you within

00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:18,119
minutes when you pop out of compliance

00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:20,009
we can tell you about network

00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:21,660
connections as well and you can there

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,399
are network connections on that slide on

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,720
those graphs if you look towards the

00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,779
right side for those of you who haven't

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,730
you'll see two switches and the switches

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,199
we discovered the switch ports were

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,879
discovered and the labeling on the

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,759
switch port switch the switch knew about

00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,249
was also discovered for example there's

00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,769
one of the Jax's labeled kitchen north

00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:44,790
wall white Jack the other one is labeled

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:47,369
Alan's office north wall grey Jack now I

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,649
told the switch that but I didn't tell

00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:52,769
my software that so the software

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:55,019
discovered it through the switch so the

00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:57,029
information could be incorrect but the

00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,799
fact that it's import three is not it

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:04,739
knows it's in port three because the

00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:06,269
packet came from port three so so I

00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:08,699
think the things we do which are unique

00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,799
and interesting is we we worry about

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:14,519
security in a way that keeps you up to

00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,589
date within minutes from a compliance

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,600
perspective in other words it isn't like

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:21,540
an annual process you go through it's

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,220
like instant relatively instantaneous

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,529
within minutes you'll know if you've you

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,929
made something out of compliance we have

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:32,129
scalability like nothing else and we

00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,389
complexity is like you likely your

00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,759
biggest problem but i'll talk more about

00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:38,339
it here in a minute we help you reduce

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,519
and manage complexity and i'll tell you

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,899
reducing complexity sounds especially

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,250
one of the things that i always told

00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,280
people and it's really true

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,860
high availability is complexity is the

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,200
enemy of reliability and everything you

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,840
add to your system adds complexity but

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,030
our belief is that we net lower the

00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,800
complexity because one product does all

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,210
of these areas together rather than

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,590
having four products that you have to

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:08,310
then hook together with shell scripts

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:10,020
and and chewing gum and baling wire so

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,270
as I said here complexity is the enemy

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,030
of reliability complexity is likely the

00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,010
biggest problem that you have everything

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,140
else all your other problems are

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,670
significantly impacted and flow out of

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,460
complexity in a lot of different ways

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,550
the ways we help you with complexity is

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,490
that there's it's almost zero

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,680
configuration it's not quite zero but

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,720
it's almost zero configuration to have

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,640
it do all the things it does so you

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,150
don't have to configure all the things

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,550
we do you don't have to configure the

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,320
the monitoring you don't have to

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,170
configure the discovery you don't have

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,270
to configure the the information that we

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,500
have in here you don't have to there is

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,820
some amount of configuration you have to

00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,390
tell us which rules to apply for

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,910
security and the fact that all of these

00:16:54,390 --> 00:17:00,510
are so so the near zero configuration

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,310
that lowers the complexity the fact that

00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,330
all the service that these four

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,339
different services are tightly

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,890
integrated out of one database in one

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,260
view of the world instead of four that

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,360
lowers the complexity and the last one

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,650
is not a way we can lower the complexity

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,660
but we can help you manage the

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,850
complexity that you have better and

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,800
that's part of providing you insight and

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:22,829
understanding into that other complexity

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,180
so I can't make that go away we didn't

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,850
comply city is actually a tricky thing

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,530
and it's hard to do and I don't claim

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,360
we've reduced it dramatically but I

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,700
think we helped you managed it and help

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,970
you manage it we reduced it a little bit

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,240
which is a good thing and and we help

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:43,160
you manage the complexity better by

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:46,290
giving you better insight into it so

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,840
discovery drives everything else the

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,820
discovery is continuous and interesting

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,240
enough it does it in a way that does not

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,780
set off security alarms we will not set

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,050
off you know we don't do port scans we

00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,820
don't

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,380
do pings and in fact we do better than

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,090
that we have a lot more detail a lot

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,290
more information you can get my port

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:09,180
scans or pings we have extensible

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,810
exception monitoring our estimation is

00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,760
more than 100,000 systems and discovery

00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,710
drives best practice analysis initially

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,330
concentrating on security but there you

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,230
know those are the those the ones people

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,930
get the most excited about but there we

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,130
also do a couple of the rules of

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:30,950
non-security discovery as well and

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:35,250
everything goes into this central graph

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,810
cmdb so we use a graph database one of

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,760
the things that people talk about in

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,650
ITIL is you ought to have the

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,830
relationships in the database as well

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,410
not just the objects well of course in a

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,530
in a graph database the relationships

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:51,150
are full our first-class citizens so in

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,730
this respect it's a very much better

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:55,380
approach we you can ask our database

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,090
like things like tell me everything

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,690
which depends upon the server directly

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:03,150
or indirectly and if you have if we are

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,220
if we've also been allowed to discover

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,080
the switch connect connectivity where

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,460
you can also do things like tell me

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
everything which is which is all the

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,590
services running behind the switchport

00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,220
directly or indirectly so you can or if

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,840
you want to the whole switch so we have

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,280
it written all the applications we can

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,450
take advantage of this but we have all

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,760
the data to do that so anyway this is

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,840
our this is my song and dance right this

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,120
is this is what I think we do so how

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,220
many people are skeptical scalability

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,900
without complexity discovery without

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,770
pings report scans not sending off

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,690
security honest how many people think

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm full of well you know my eyes are

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,550
brown and it's you know some people

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:51,420
think it's that's because it's up to

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:53,220
here and so if you're skeptical I'm

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,180
really glad because you know what that

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,270
means it means you've been paying

00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,990
attention I just made some kind of

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,520
outrageous claims didn't I and well

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,830
let's talk about whether that makes any

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,430
sense all right let's go on into the

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:10,110
technology so I can explain how we scale

00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,060
in a way that your grandmother would

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:18,870
understand even if your grandma

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:21,420
there isn't a grace hopper so for this I

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,790
have to sit down in so at my church on

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,650
Wednesday night we get together for a

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,600
meal and we stand around with hold hands

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,220
like this and with our eyes closed and

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,260
the Pat we stand in this kind of circle

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,330
that pastor prays over the food while

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm there with my eyes has their eyes

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:42,000
cuz we're holding hands if Aunt Sally

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:45,000
passes out who notices first the two

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,340
people next to her right so how many

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,380
hands do you have to have to participate

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:55,110
in this human monitoring arrangement

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,370
hello to yes that's the right answer you

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,690
could also say the standard number

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,790
that's that's good too so if i had a

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,690
thousand people to this arrangement how

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:08,370
many hands do you have to have to did

00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,840
your work go up because i added a

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,990
thousand people to this monitoring

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,700
arrangement there you go we have our

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,930
computers hold hands each system then if

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,450
you prefer the computer science the

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:23,850
explanation each system then has two

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,590
neighbors systems and i don't use the

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,150
word this looks like a ring but it is

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,560
different from what you the computer

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,270
scientists would think of as a ring and

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,610
i don't use that word because when i say

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:36,600
ring people here token there are no

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,910
tokens here we have only neighbors yeah

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,830
so so a here since heart beats to f a

00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,140
sense heart beats to be f sense heart

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,570
beats to a and E be sense heart beats to

00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,980
a and c c send heart beats to be and d

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,330
and so on i think you can figure this

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:54,570
out right now so everyone sends a very

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,270
small amount of traffic to two neighbors

00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,110
and no matter how many systems you have

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,360
that work never goes up the work /

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,980
system never goes up and one of the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,140
other things is interesting is it

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,110
doesn't create a hotspot in the network

00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,430
near the monitoring software does it

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,960
normally monitoring and i know you guys

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,490
know this it's like are you okay are you

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,230
okay how about you are you okay are you

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,570
okay about you in the back are you okay

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,820
and so on right and that work goes up

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,320
and up and and it creates a hot it

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,720
creates a lot of work on the central

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,860
server and it creates a hot spot on the

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,049
network in the vicinity

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,190
the central server one of the reasons

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:33,600
people often wind up adding another

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,549
network it's not the only reason but

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,030
that's a reason why people often add a

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,980
second network just for for this so if

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,440
you have an hour during which time

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,620
nothing goes up and nothing comes down

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,900
and nothing changes configuration then

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:54,330
during that hour the central server does

00:22:50,900 --> 00:23:01,309
nothing and doing nothing scales really

00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:04,770
well and so we try and do nothing a lot

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:08,720
so let's get a back-of-the-envelope feel

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:13,980
for that scalability now if you have a

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:16,260
10,000 alert about events a day you have

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,559
a very big data center right or you need

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:24,780
to get a new job you know something very

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,370
bad is going on or you have 10,000 alert

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,780
able events it's considered a very high

00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:32,400
number does anybody think that that's

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:35,429
not true yeah so but from our

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,890
perspective all we have to do is handle

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:42,780
10,000 events per day now that might be

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,090
as many as 50,000 packets how many

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,990
people think it's a strain for my laptop

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:51,780
to handle 50,000 packets a day but it's

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:54,360
a strain for you to you do right well my

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,850
lap cup I have a pretty good laptop I

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,460
could probably do that on a pentium 3

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,620
right I might have trouble getting

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,340
enough RAM on it you know to manage to

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,790
model everything but as far as keeping

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,950
up with it network wise that's nothing

00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:14,340
10,000 packets a day so the scalability

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,169
changes dramatically people get that

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,860
does that make sense why that should

00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:21,600
change dramatically and so that's why I

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,700
say a hundred thousand systems is not at

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,440
all out of range it's not at all at a

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,720
range if one in ten systems has a

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,490
problem every day you have you have a

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:34,950
problem you find another job before they

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,230
find out so it's a very different kind

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,680
of arrangement so it by the way and if a

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,740
fails we then make F&B neighbors

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,020
and you know this is called linked list

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,360
management right from Donald Knuth

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,310
canoes vol 1 right how to how to man how

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,960
to how to maintain a me link list and

00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:55,700
became so one of the other things too is

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,410
sometimes people they think well doesn't

00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,870
that slow down as you add systems to the

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:03,380
environment well no because there's no

00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:05,030
token I mean if Aunt Sally passes out

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,450
are you going to whisper to the person

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,530
next to you go find a doctor and around

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,310
the rate are you going to pick up the

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,480
phone and call 101 1911 in the US I

00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,250
don't know what you pick up the call the

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,380
hospital right you know pick call the

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,660
doctor with your phone that's a unicast

00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,210
or you could shout out is doctors Jack

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,160
here right either and that's a broadcast

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,430
either one works but what you wouldn't

00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:31,760
do is ask the person ASB and BSC and CS

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,230
D&D ask you wouldn't do that and guess

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,700
what we don't either because that

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:39,680
doesn't make any sense so this this is

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,900
on the other hand well that's the

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,700
current implementation and what we want

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,890
to do is a more sophisticated one which

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,500
we haven't done which scales even better

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:51,500
especially across sites this is really

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,710
cool so those you in the back have

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,180
already seen this so who already heard

00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,310
my talk before but basically then we

00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,290
create imagine you create one ring purse

00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:04,610
which instead of one I know I used the

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:06,470
word ring 11 ring purse which then and

00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,510
each of each of these then is a switch

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,960
right this is which Nets a switch and so

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:15,350
on now something interesting happens

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,730
ninety-five percent of your on this

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:20,060
diagram ninety-five percent of your

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,650
traffic stays within a switch traffic

00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,750
within us which is your most reliable

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,960
bandwidth and is your cheapest bandwidth

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,820
write some stuff you pay the least four

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,320
so that that that's kind of cool but of

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,910
course if a switch fails you want to

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,370
know right you don't want to have it

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,540
there used to be an old science fiction

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,640
there's an old science fiction story

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,800
called I have no mouth and I must scream

00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,770
if you know Harlan Ellison and science

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,240
fiction story they're all digging but

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,060
they can't no one can hear them because

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,150
there's which is then so instead what we

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,539
do is create a ring purse which ring per

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,129
subnet and this machine then is is we

00:26:53,539 --> 00:27:02,539
nominate one machine on every switch to

00:26:55,129 --> 00:27:05,299
be part of the the subnet ring and so so

00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:07,850
then when this this machine fails it has

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:11,299
two neighbors here on this way and two

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,399
neighbors here that way so when it fails

00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:15,320
how many reports do I hear of its

00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,999
failure this machine fails if this

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,739
machine fails how many reports do I hear

00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:24,409
of its failure for that's correct now

00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:28,330
the question is if the switch fails how

00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:28,330
many reports do I hear of its failure to

00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:37,729
that's interesting isn't it now I can

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,139
just wait around a little bit and decide

00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:43,070
I'm not going to hear any more reports

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:46,340
and say oh that server hasn't failed

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,320
it's a switch that's failed both might

00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,659
have failed that's also possible but the

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,549
big thing is the switches failed just by

00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:53,659
listening to now the other thing is how

00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:56,859
many people think it depends on what

00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:59,119
kind of switch you have here it doesn't

00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,859
how you know it doesn't matter what kind

00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,119
of switch you have our don't have to

00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,269
know the topology of who's on which

00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:07,809
switch and lldp will tell you that

00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:10,099
people how many people here know lldp

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,739
better than most audiences I'll tell you

00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,720
that most people don't so it says this

00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:17,239
link level discovery protocol which is

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,399
similar to Cisco's CDP cisco cisco

00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:21,349
discovery protocol and some of you might

00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:24,499
also know that but lldp is I tripoli's

00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:28,249
version of the same thing so that's

00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:30,200
that's how this works and and now

00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:33,379
imagine then that we also create a ring

00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,940
one ring per subnet to allow for the

00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,669
possibility that something that's common

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,489
to the subnet might fail and then

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:42,710
imagine that we have multiple sites and

00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:45,470
we create yet another ring with one of

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:48,649
these one machine nominated from each

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,289
site and create a site ring now we can

00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:55,059
monitor dozens or hundreds of sites with

00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:59,359
practically no traffic between sites

00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:02,570
just a handful of packets per per

00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,789
interval because now everything we've

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,830
delegated everything down to the level

00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,370
whether each site monitors itself and we

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,410
just monitor

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:12,500
one machine on each side in the same

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,740
fashion so this also this is very very

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,690
cool if you have lots of different sites

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,660
because the traffic's is is negligible

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,210
it doesn't really it's it's if this is a

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,650
problem if any of this traffic is a

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,270
problem to your network you had a

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:30,110
problem before we got here and you

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,700
should fix it because if we pushed you

00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,530
over the edge something was going to

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:40,550
push you over the edge tomorrow and it

00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:44,059
wasn't going to be me so um so that's

00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,800
that's how we monitor servers so how we

00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,660
monitor services how many people are for

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,230
me with pacemaker or Linux a che or

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,840
heartbeat or something like that yeah so

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,090
there they use a technique an API called

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,679
the open cluster framework API people

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,860
kind of how many people know that a

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,960
little bit yeah so basically that's an

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:09,380
API that's kind of like an it scripts on

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,970
steroids which which is to say vastly

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,580
more powerful than init scripts are more

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,500
interesting and more interesting than

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,670
systemd in this respect to because it

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,240
can actually tell you what the service

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,429
is working not just whether it is

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,780
process is still alive it processes in

00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,580
the process table does not mean it's

00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,320
working we can tell you whether it's

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,960
working and that's how this API work so

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,970
we use the open cluster framework

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,030
standard we use the LSB we will

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:37,790
eventually add systemd and not just for

00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,350
my agent api so if you can if it can be

00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,630
monitored by nagios or it can be

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,220
monitored by the open ocf open close to

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,320
framework then we can use it to monitor

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,660
it and we delegate that work to each

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,550
machine there's a rule of delegation

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,080
that says if you don't do if you don't

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,200
have someone to delegate the work to you

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,840
have to do it yourself and since we want

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,760
to scale well we delegate everything out

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,350
and this works very effectively and it's

00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,510
a proven technique that hi village

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:07,400
systems are used for you know years and

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,870
years so if you want to argue you know

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,730
one way of looking at this is what we

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:14,530
have is we have a no news is good news

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:16,850
philosophy except that it's reliable

00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,850
that we have those together at the same

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,200
time now the ocf can also ocf agents can

00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,880
also start stopping my great

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,649
services as well now I'm not taking

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,179
advantage of that but the API allows it

00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:30,919
so how does discovery work people kind

00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,870
of know how monitoring works in general

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,190
and I kind of hit on it quickly but

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,039
discovery is a little bit different deal

00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,750
but it's actually remarkably similar for

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,169
for monitoring what you're fundamentally

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,059
doing is you run a script or a binary or

00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,679
whatever and it comes back with an exit

00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,450
code that says thumbs up or thumbs down

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,820
yes it's working or no it's not it might

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,500
say they might have a it's not too good

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,809
too but the basic idea is you give an

00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,080
exit code so is working or not and it's

00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:59,090
a very simple answer so for discovery

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,519
what we do is something similar except

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:05,419
that we output JSON that describes the

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,760
thing that's being discovered so you can

00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:09,380
imagine discovery which which gives you

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,240
your network configuration you know what

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,039
what Nick's you have what IP address is

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,779
what mac addresses you can imagine

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,570
discovery separately which tells you

00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:22,820
your pam configuration maybe the

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:24,769
contents of you know of of whatever you

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,559
want basically as long as you can write

00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:30,260
a script that looks at it and transforms

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,360
whatever it's looking at into json which

00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,090
is not rocket science it's not hard at

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,899
all so what we do is we delegate that

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,850
work to the to these nanoprobes we call

00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:42,679
them this is the assimilation project

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,059
and yes it's full of bad Star Trek jokes

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:45,980
and there are other bad jokes in here

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:47,539
too we have some we borrowed some from

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,909
the Lord of the Rings which you can see

00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:51,889
if you look very carefully on on that

00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:55,279
and some from VeggieTales if you know

00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:58,100
what VeggieTales is so they they output

00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,659
JSON and then the CMA takes that data

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:05,090
stores it in a neo4j graph database and

00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:06,799
in some cases we have if you want to do

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,889
something based on that when we then you

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,389
might have a plug-in which looks at the

00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:13,220
information and validates it against

00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,500
best practice rules it might create more

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,750
nodes in the graph database it might

00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,889
create relationships whatever it needs

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:23,090
to do but the you know the main thing is

00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:24,200
to get the stuff in the database that

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,340
you can figure out what to do with it

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
later that's what that's all right

00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,539
that's our general reaction by the way

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,740
is figure something out and once you

00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,809
figured it out put in the date about you

00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,100
know collect some data and then put it

00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,830
in the database collect all of it

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,960
whatever

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,370
is and then afterwards figure out

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,750
exactly what you want to do with it but

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,880
don't worry about if you know what every

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,260
little piece is going to be used for

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,700
collect all of it because later somebody

00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,470
else may want to use that information

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,960
the part you didn't collect so just

00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,899
collect all of it and you'll see how

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,000
that comes up later so here's an example

00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,679
of what it looks like I have a script

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,940
called OS which discovery is what your

00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,029
operating system is and this is a

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,110
snippet from it output of it now it's

00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:03,480
not all of it because there's some

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,070
metadata at the front and this set of an

00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,440
extra set of curly braces and so on

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:10,800
missing but this is on the screen people

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,619
in the back can read this yes so node

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,649
name is Alan are 25 12 25 b which is my

00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:18,810
old and now defunct laptop operating

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:23,510
systems canoe linux machine is all these

00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:25,830
different x86 64 s colonel release 380

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,270
kernel version the blah blah blah and

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,300
there was more to it than that I just

00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:33,300
didn't doesn't display distributor ID is

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,240
Ubuntu tells you it's Ubuntu 30 now for

00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,560
release 1304 and code name wearing I put

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,639
the code names in there because I never

00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,200
can remember which one goes with one and

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,790
if you don't have a code name well it

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,909
might be missing or blank right but i

00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,830
don't care if it's there if we have if

00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,540
there is a code name we put it in and we

00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,460
can find out find it out we put it in

00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,960
there if there's not it doesn't matter

00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,810
you know for example the code names for

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:05,849
fedora are very clever like fedora 22 is

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:08,760
TW en t y TW o that's the code name 22

00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:10,320
spell down but it's there we don't care

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,730
if it's meaningful that's up that's not

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,400
my problem whether it's meaningful

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,320
that's somebody else's problem and

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,290
here's an example of what it looks like

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,700
to discover that we have an SSH agent

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,150
running on a machine now this this

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,740
particular chunk of discovery has lots

00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,910
and lots and lots more stuff but this is

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,920
the interesting part from our

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,130
perspective and you'll see how why in a

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,320
minute so we have a discovery of

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,869
something called sshd which apparently I

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,240
only and then it has the executable is

00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:42,240
at user s been sshd the command line is

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,069
ssh d minus capital d running as root

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,970
groupwise root current working directory

00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:48,660
/ the address is listening to or 0 20 20

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,910
20 which

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:57,809
is any you know in TCP port 22 the

00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,599
protocol is TCP so that tells me that we

00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,930
have we're offering a service on port 22

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,960
and it is user has been sshd with these

00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:08,849
arguments now you and I know that that

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,079
means this is the ssh daemon right

00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:15,089
because but of course the computers have

00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,309
to be told that that's the ssh daemon

00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:23,940
they just know this right they know what

00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:26,520
this is so now what does it look like we

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,349
also discover clients on the network as

00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,579
well as servers so what does it look

00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:35,099
like when you ssh into an ssh daemon

00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,930
it's very similar right it's almost the

00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,670
same except that the client address has

00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,720
to be a concrete address it can't be the

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,760
na 0 0 20 20 and of course the user ID

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,859
and group ID are different and the

00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,809
current directory is different right but

00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:54,150
this is what it looks like to then

00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:57,900
discover that someone is SS aging into a

00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,640
system now SSH is a good example in a

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,200
bad example it's easy to set up but it's

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,180
not such a good example from a practical

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,190
perspective but if you put those

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,220
together in a graph database what you

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:10,319
see is we have an SSH which is connected

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,470
to this IP port address and this guy is

00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:15,750
listening to the same IP port address

00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:20,819
and that means this guy has a dependency

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:24,089
upon this one does that seem clear that

00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:29,130
makes sense to somebody at least one

00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:30,450
person yeah okay people in the front

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,619
apparently sharper than the people in

00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:37,079
the back sorry guys in the back so this

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:39,089
guy is then he's connected to this port

00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,250
this guy is listening to this port and

00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:43,260
that port through the any you know

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,700
basically what it does is it looks at

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,569
what I dresses are available at the time

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:51,150
this guy is discovered and it then

00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:54,240
creates these links which say that this

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:56,819
guy is a service listening on that port

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,250
this guy is a client connecting to that

00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:02,309
port so that means we have a dependency

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,259
which is discovered just through

00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,789
that now it happens to be I'm SS aging

00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,229
to myself which you say is kind of silly

00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:10,079
but it makes the graph smaller and

00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:12,719
easier to display on the screen so and

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,729
this is actually on this the graph i

00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,549
passed around this is a an outtake from

00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:22,109
that graph that's a piece that this date

00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:24,239
data is on that graph and it's running

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:27,900
on this machine and this one's running

00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,640
on that machine and and this east 0 is

00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,289
when providing this so all this

00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,519
information is in here and yeah it's

00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:36,869
really on that graph that I passed

00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:40,199
around so that's how service

00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:41,369
dependencies are found now we do

00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,199
something similar for switch

00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:47,459
dependencies and though these are also

00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:50,519
from that graph as well so here's this

00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:52,170
machine which has this Nick east 0 which

00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:54,989
has a wired to relationship with this

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:59,329
Nick so that says this Nick east 0 is

00:38:54,989 --> 00:39:03,539
wired to switch port 3 which is G 3 on

00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:05,160
this switch the this particular brand of

00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:06,900
switched names the switches by the mac

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,209
address that's what it says the name of

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,259
this which is that's fine it's unique

00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:14,759
and I told the switch that I told the

00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:17,009
switch this was kitchen north wall why

00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:19,499
Jack everything on all of these things

00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:21,660
is discovered without configuration no

00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:23,579
configuration it just discovered it

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,589
except of course the fact i told the

00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:27,150
switch this separately manually but I my

00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:29,369
software didn't discover it I mean

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,719
didn't I didn't enter it into my sudden

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,219
nothing it was entered into my software

00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,979
manual I needed this manually into the

00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:38,400
switch and the switch is a netgear

00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:40,709
gigabit smart switch and it has port 3

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,259
and port 21 and this guy was connected

00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:44,910
to port 80 on this guy which is port 21

00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:47,640
now this guy didn't have a label so it

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,920
didn't display it I didn't tell it what

00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,469
led one was I think that's just because

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,869
it's in the basement and it's just in

00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:59,999
Iraq and there's no special able to it

00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:01,739
right there's nothing it's nothing which

00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:03,719
one wouldn't Paul yeah because I think

00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:05,489
that actually doesn't even run it is

00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:11,130
just wire that runs across the ceiling

00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:12,689
in the basement so how many people

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,979
already have a good idea why you want to

00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:16,440
use a graph database instead of

00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:19,930
relational database for this

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,730
two three or four people so here's my

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,400
reasoning of why I wanted to use a graph

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,920
database first of all is the is as

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,660
humans describe systems as graphs my

00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,700
experience is when the computer thinks

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,470
like I think I screw it up a lot less

00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,850
often when I'm managing in anybody else

00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,190
have that experience where you met

00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,990
misunderstood how the software works and

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,119
so you stuck your fingers in the gear

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:46,390
and came out with wounds on your hands

00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:49,690
and blood on the computers it sucks

00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,610
doesn't it so dependency and discovery

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,520
information naturally turn out to be a

00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,230
graph speed of a graph traversal depends

00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,490
on the size of a sub graph in other

00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,830
words how many nodes you have to touch

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:03,850
to do the traversal not on the size of

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:05,710
the total graph so from a normally with

00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,480
a relational database the indexes get

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:11,170
slower and slower and slower and slower

00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,210
as you add data to them and with a graph

00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,590
database you do have to use an index to

00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:16,510
get in the first time but if you're

00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,460
doing a query that then follows links

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,680
you know follows the relationships those

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,300
didn't no longer depend upon the size of

00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,400
the graph they depend on the size how

00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,690
many nodes you have to traverse to

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:32,080
follow that not how many not not the

00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,180
total size of the graph root cause

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,700
queries are graph traversals and these

00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:40,300
are notoriously slow in in relational

00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:42,910
databases so here's here's an example of

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,920
a kind of query that you can do is

00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,210
anybody ever seen a cascading failure

00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,470
where one thing led to the failure of

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,410
other things which led to the failure of

00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:52,930
other things yeah so here's how you

00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,700
would help here's how you can use this

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,180
to help you deal with a cascading

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,950
failure you take your set of graph nodes

00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,960
that that represent the things that have

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,330
failed and you do a query that says tell

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,640
me which of those graph nodes does not

00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:09,670
depend on any of the other graph nodes

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,090
in the graph and that is the one which

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:14,830
is probably your patient zero the one

00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,950
which caught is the place to start

00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:20,590
looking for what caused the problem even

00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:22,210
if you don't know this particular peak

00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,910
corner of the infrastructure we know a

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,859
lot about it already now that's not a

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,420
common case but that particular kind of

00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:29,450
thing we have to then in relational

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,599
database you have to join

00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:34,400
it and join it and join it and join it

00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,599
and that's very slow it's the slowest

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,540
thing a graph database can I mean a

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,640
relational database can do and of course

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,180
visualization is natural as you can see

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,589
from the graph I passed around one of

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,240
the other things that goes on here that

00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:49,450
is it's interesting that's not

00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,650
specifically for a graph database but if

00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:55,430
everything is through a rigid schema

00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:57,050
like a relational database then then

00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,220
every time you have a new kind of

00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,930
hardware come in and you want to

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,180
represent some new piece of data for it

00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,500
you have to then revise the schema which

00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,349
means you have to modify the software

00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,720
you have to stop the stop to stop to

00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:11,510
stop your system you have to then run an

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,099
application which then reformats to the

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,660
graph database I mean that your

00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:17,450
relational database with the new schema

00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:20,300
and so on and so on and that's a that's

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,770
a very time-consuming thing for which

00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,800
time you're out of out of business to

00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:26,329
are you doing that so that's actually a

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,920
nice thing not specifically to graph

00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:30,680
databases but graph databases are

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,720
typically schemas or mostly schemas and

00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,910
then from my perspective from writing

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,700
the code my graph I use this graph

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:41,569
database like it's an object database my

00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,250
objects are graph nodes so my

00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:45,859
perspective is I just have these these

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,510
objects and I mess around with them when

00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:50,290
i get done i say commit transaction and

00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:53,240
it does its thing so that's kind of nice

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:55,280
here's some examples of some built-in am

00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,440
i doing on time what do I have five more

00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,060
minutes what do I have here all right no

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,710
20 more minutes ten ten minutes 2220

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:08,150
okay yeah okay good that I'm in good

00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:10,880
shape here's some example queries tell

00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,680
me all the IP tell me all the IP ports

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,300
all the services i'm offering what ports

00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,790
are on what IP addresses are on and all

00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,099
that stuff tell me all the switch

00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:22,220
connections tell me which systems have

00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:23,690
cry are currently crashed tell me all

00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,960
the systems which we're currently are

00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:30,140
currently shut down gracefully tell me

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,109
all the services which are down now till

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,210
tell me tell me who owns this IP tell me

00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:36,740
he owns this MAC address tell me all the

00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,560
IP addresses that you don't know what

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,210
they are what are all these IP addresses

00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,369
out there that we don't know what they

00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,799
are and again this is all done

00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:49,369
way by listening to our packets so that

00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:50,749
I haven't pinged anyone now I'll tell

00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:53,529
you a story about that i'll make it as

00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:56,150
quick as I can I I ran this stuff at my

00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:58,849
woman I know wrote the software for this

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,319
discovery of IP addresses and so I put

00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,059
it on my system at home the one that

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,099
described there and more stuff to it

00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:05,749
than that but I started up and I

00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:07,430
recognized all the IP addresses then it

00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:08,990
was time to go to bed so I went to bed I

00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,579
got up the next morning there were three

00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,890
additional IP addresses that weren't

00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:14,630
there when I went to bed so I liked the

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,369
first one it was in my fixed IP address

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:18,109
range so I knew what it was the second

00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:20,569
was in my fixed IP address range I knew

00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:22,940
it was the third one was an IP address

00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:25,249
that was not in my twas a variable IP

00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,329
address and I didn't remember I had no

00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:32,089
idea what it was so said i'll ping it i

00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:33,470
get no response this is my home address

00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,150
how many people think you know what's on

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,579
your home network well at least ought to

00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,839
write I just feel the same way and I

00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:40,009
wrote this software and it's my network

00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:43,160
and I don't know what this is and I'm

00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:44,569
getting a little disturbed so then I go

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,160
to look up the mac address you know the

00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:47,749
oh you I the first three bites of the

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,039
mac address to see the manufacturer is

00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:53,390
it's a company I've never heard of now

00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,279
I'm getting kind of really kind of

00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:57,499
nervous and getting a little upset about

00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:59,059
it right so I go look as well what does

00:45:57,499 --> 00:46:03,170
this company make anyway and it says

00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:06,220
they make low-power Wi-Fi Nick's for the

00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:08,779
battery-powered Internet of Things and

00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:13,460
then I realize what it is it's my

00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:15,289
bathroom scale you step on it it does

00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:17,960
this thing it comes on gets an IP

00:46:15,289 --> 00:46:20,900
address sends its data up to Fitbit I

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,069
step off of it it powers down how many

00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,210
people think you would ever find that

00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:29,299
with a ping never never find it I found

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:30,799
it like that it's a much better

00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:33,670
technique than things and it doesn't

00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:36,680
have no basically no cost on the network

00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:38,329
so Oh what all services you have which

00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,739
are unmonitored tell me all the services

00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:40,910
i'm offering but not monitoring and we

00:46:39,739 --> 00:46:44,299
going to demo some of these in just a

00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,619
second best practice analysis I'm I'll

00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:47,690
have to go this little faster than I

00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,339
want but it'll show up in the demo so

00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:51,920
we're doing a variety of different best

00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,539
practice analysis and basically what

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,799
this does it looks at your configuration

00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:56,720
the things we've discovered and compares

00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:59,359
it against best practices

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,609
and because we have this protocol set up

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,400
so that with only it only sends us

00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:06,530
information when something has changed

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,230
so basically what this means is we

00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:11,390
evaluate best practices exactly and only

00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,730
when something changes we don't do it

00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,310
weekly we don't do it quarterly we don't

00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:18,440
do it annually we don't we do it exactly

00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:22,220
at the right time when something has

00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,440
changed so that's what how we can then

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,240
tell you within minutes that you've gone

00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,520
that something is falling out of

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,619
compliance which changes the game as far

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,820
as the process here's why normally how

00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,920
people find out that they're out of

00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,410
compliance is one of it is two different

00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,880
high drama ways first one is your

00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,099
auditor can come around and tell you

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,290
that you're out of compliance and and

00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:48,440
this makes people very unhappy right and

00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:50,150
the second way you can find out is even

00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,050
worse and that's your security team

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:55,099
comes around and tells you you did what

00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,660
don't you know that you shouldn't do

00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:58,369
that and we have this guy who's behind

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,680
the firewall now doing all kinds

00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:03,200
exfiltrating all kinds of data and it's

00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,630
because of you and you don't like to

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,109
hear either of those things do you so

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:13,150
what you want to do is no sooner so that

00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:16,010
you can have adult conversations and

00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:18,260
change it from high drama to adult

00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,589
conversations how many people in here

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,060
have children so you know you ever heard

00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:24,830
the phrase it's an English phrase that

00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,140
says teachable moment you know the

00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,970
teachable moment is there's a certain

00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,530
time when a child has done something

00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,330
wrong when you can tell them something

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,920
and it clicks and it makes sense and

00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:36,080
that's usually right after they've seen

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,970
the consequences of what they've done we

00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:42,830
can transform these high drama things

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:44,359
into teachable moments seriously instead

00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:45,589
of getting yelled at by somebody now you

00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:47,150
know and you can have an adult

00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:49,450
discussion because the bad guys don't

00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:52,790
know when the auditor doesn't know right

00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:57,770
so this is this changes things in a very

00:48:52,790 --> 00:49:01,849
good way so anyway you've read this by

00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,810
now so what we're going to look at a lot

00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:04,099
of different things i'm getting you

00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,160
better than this i'm going to show you

00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:10,340
some examples we also work with another

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,930
project which i'll talk about here

00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,030
the more of different things I need to

00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,620
probably cut this down anyway we

00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,420
basically do security best practice

00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,510
analysis we also collect check sums of

00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:23,240
anything that's talking on the network

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:24,770
including libraries and jars uh at which

00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,360
we don't do anything with it but it's

00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:27,830
clear that if you have 100 copies of a

00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,940
binary which is the same and one that's

00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:34,480
different maybe you want to figure out

00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:37,970
why we want to also looking at doing it

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,230
in mon profiling of new mac addresses

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,020
which would be interesting we're not

00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:43,880
currently doing it that would be it's

00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,960
potentially career limiting so you want

00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,280
to make sure before you turn that

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,170
feature on that you have the permission

00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:51,260
and understanding of your security

00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:53,090
people so we also started a nike best

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,890
practices project and the purpose of it

00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,210
is just to collect the descriptions of

00:49:54,890 --> 00:50:00,500
all the different things that you might

00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:03,110
have best practices surrounding because

00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,850
honestly checking whether value is one

00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,770
is like one line of code explaining to

00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,420
you why it needs to be one that's a very

00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:12,980
much more complicated thing and i'll

00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:14,450
show you what i mean by that um we we

00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,360
want to do multiple language support

00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,980
which the for example the American what

00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,380
we started with is the US government's

00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,780
idea of security best practices for the

00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,790
federal government in the US and those

00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,230
of course I know they'll so it'll shock

00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:30,050
you but they don't have any provision in

00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,580
your XML for any language but English so

00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,770
we fixed that here so at least in our

00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,260
copy of our version of those same rules

00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:40,310
you can have multiple languages even

00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,270
German but so that's an opportunity for

00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,190
those of you who like to translate

00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,960
things to translate them into into jet

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,550
from English into German here's an

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,930
example of a short description of one of

00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,030
these things from this process the

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,010
system must limit the ability of process

00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:54,710
to have right and simultaneous write and

00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:58,370
execute access it doesn't tell you why

00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,910
but this of course is to prevent a stack

00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:04,120
over a stack of stack smashing attacks

00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:06,470
right so and here's the long description

00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,940
and goes on to explain what these

00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:09,560
different things are and how that works

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,750
in the processor and blah blah blah blah

00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,840
blah blah blah and so this is a long

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:16,040
description so this is a lot of text and

00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,530
getting it right and explaining it right

00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,090
is actually a lot of work and then

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,680
here's a further explanation that tells

00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:24,080
you how to detect whether this is true

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,030
manually they didn't put the the

00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,100
color but I did so you do this different

00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,780
things and look at this thing in the out

00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,760
and tells you how to tell whether or not

00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,200
you have this violated this constraint

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,670
manually and here's the rule which which

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,570
validates it right which is basically

00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:44,090
Colonel exec shield has to equal one

00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:46,310
right so it's a little bit obscure it's

00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:49,310
sort of Lisp like but it's not hard it's

00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,290
you know function calls and it's called

00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:53,960
it's a category security this name is

00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,550
NIST whatever right and the idea of this

00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,100
is that we would then be able to then

00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,870
look at the best practice rules and get

00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,550
the full explanation out currently in

00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,520
English but ideally in multiple

00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:06,710
languages in the future so this is easy

00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,670
the other parts actually much harder and

00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,310
that's why we want to get people

00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,830
together on that too that's called IT

00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,940
best practices on info and up by the way

00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,980
I have some more at literature on this

00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,600
outside on a table out here some of you

00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,920
picked it up and we'll and i'll be happy

00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,040
to talk to you more about this after the

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:26,870
and i'm also doing as i said will be

00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,970
around on thursday for the hackathon so

00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,530
here's another rule for preventing

00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,330
buffer bloat how many people in the room

00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:36,500
besides those already talked to today

00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:37,910
know what buffer bloat is yeah so it's

00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,590
basically the idea that there's a

00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:42,020
setting such that it destroys your

00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,790
latency on your network and the default

00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:47,870
on linux is to destroy the latency on

00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:50,030
your network so you should follow this

00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,100
rule because if you don't you and you

00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:54,290
have anything which latency sensitive it

00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,670
will one day have problems with this if

00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,790
you have something that's high bandwidth

00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,770
on the same set of network connections

00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,420
and it's more complicated than this that

00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,310
i don't really have time i want to get

00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,600
into the demo so let's skip this for now

00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,790
and we'll talk more about buffer bloat

00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,710
later but the point is it is not a

00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:12,050
security constraint it's a networking

00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:15,140
constraint we don't care rules are rules

00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:18,380
data is data we do tell you which is

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:20,930
which so we want to demonstrate the

00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,370
nellis into the demo and here's an

00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,580
example of one of the demos I can do a

00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:27,410
lot more than this nothing in the demo I

00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,400
did not supply any configuration I wipe

00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:34,070
out the database and everything comes

00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,200
from a discovery and I'll go into that

00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,180
some more when I get to that point yeah

00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,839
okay

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:43,329
so I have the script and I had it in a

00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,700
very clever way I call it demo means we

00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:49,540
do a stop demo make sure I didn't okay

00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:54,069
what happened here make sure that I

00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:55,359
don't have anything laying around from a

00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:57,069
peep now it doesn't look like i had a

00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,940
demo still laying around so let's go do

00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:03,970
a demo what this does I'll explain to

00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,410
you so we've started up the CMA and I

00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,790
told it to erase the database so

00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,260
anything that's in here everything it

00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:10,349
has nothing in the database when it

00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,910
starts and then I started a couple other

00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:15,510
processes which then load the best

00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:19,059
practices rules and another one which

00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:21,040
it's in here somewhere loads the queries

00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,359
so i can do queries and it waits around

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,359
a little bit here and it will do some

00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,369
other stuff in a bit and i'll start the

00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:29,859
nanoprobe now this is says the nanoprobe

00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:31,960
or the agent has been started now in the

00:54:29,859 --> 00:54:33,190
process it discovers where the central

00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,510
server is happens to be on the same

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,599
machine because i only have one machine

00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:39,760
and so now it begins to evaluate these

00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:43,240
best practice rules as this data comes

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,700
in from the discovery and it's going to

00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:47,200
fail probably sixty percent of the rules

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,520
and passed about forty percent that's

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,220
about what it does this is a standard

00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,220
Ubuntu configuration let's pick one of

00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:56,559
these and explain what it is well okay

00:54:54,220 --> 00:55:01,180
let's pick one of these because it's

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,790
going to so maybe one of these I think

00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,020
we're done now now yeah we right we're

00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:08,040
done with that so let's pick one of

00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:14,530
these is not going to go off the screen

00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:16,569
well so I think the thing is I made the

00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:19,030
screen I made the font larger and so

00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:20,829
things go a lot faster so here's one

00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:23,319
that says we failed the one that says

00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:26,349
that this is basically one that's based

00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,599
off of practice and it says that net dot

00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:30,660
ipv4 dot-com taught all that sand

00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:33,960
redirects ought to be zero and it's not

00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:37,990
okay now that happens to be rural NIST

00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,430
v30 8601 and you could go then to the IP

00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,559
missed practices project and get you all

00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:43,839
the text that goes with that so you can

00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:46,030
then understand what what security can

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,440
straight you just violated now it's also

00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:48,700
interesting that it says it's updating

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,650
check some data for a hundred twenty-one

00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,130
files now what you didn't see because it

00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,020
went off this

00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:56,050
as I requested check some data for about

00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:59,110
80 files but it discovered is doing

00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:00,940
discovery 421 and that's because when i

00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:02,980
get when it goes to discover looks at

00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,720
the things I told her to discover it

00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:08,800
doesn't ldd on them LD people know ldd

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,810
tells you what I'll library is it's

00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,130
linked against and so now we also do

00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:15,460
check sums on the things it's linked

00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:19,540
against automatically and because we

00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:21,280
discovered the parameters that were you

00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:23,040
know the you saw where I get the

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,660
argument list of all the arguments and

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,850
for example if it's a Java program then

00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,650
it has an argument called my dash CP and

00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,330
the thing that follows it's a class path

00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,840
and it's like really really really big

00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:37,270
and so we picked that all those out and

00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:42,970
we do do check sums on all the jars as

00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:45,160
well so so interesting enough now we

00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,440
didn't say in this one off the screen

00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,230
and service so and so is now operational

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,430
I have discovered that neo4j is running

00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,260
on this machine I already knew this or

00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,850
personally I knew this but it discovered

00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,850
that neo4j is running on the machine and

00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:00,840
saying it's now operational and RPC bind

00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:05,020
on this machine is now operational and

00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:08,920
now check SSH meaning it found SSH is

00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:10,810
now operational check load its

00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,400
operational what it means by check load

00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:15,040
is that it's not failing the check load

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,140
constraint so it's it and all of this is

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,630
discovered automatically everything that

00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:22,600
happened here i discovered the service i

00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:24,370
started and unfortunately some of the

00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,020
stuff on here have scrolled off the

00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,220
screen let me see if i can scroll back

00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,700
to some of the stuff that might be

00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:33,640
interesting which i don't think i have

00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:35,020
the coordination to do oh there it is we

00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,690
see if I can there we go let's see if I

00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:43,780
can do this it's a lot easier if I can

00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:46,300
see it on my screen yeah okay so here

00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,570
here it says something interesting don't

00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:52,300
know how to monitor DNS masquerade never

00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:55,410
monitor Dropbox and I hear the things

00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:57,430
that start monitoring right here and

00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:59,050
there probably some other stuff too but

00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,990
that's just an example what this is

00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,940
saying here is I don't know how to

00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,880
monitor it this is the fingerprint you

00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:07,880
know the the butt

00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,559
the binary and all the arguments and I

00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,730
don't how to monitor that that's because

00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,289
I didn't give it a rule on how to

00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:15,200
monitor it and I didn't give it an agent

00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:17,750
for monitoring it but let's let's go on

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:23,359
here and do some things by hand so

00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:24,980
there's some queries so one of the

00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,640
queries you can do is list all the

00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,349
queries now there's actually more

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,299
metadata to these queries than this but

00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:34,579
this is a short form that you get what

00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:40,160
if you do the command line interface by

00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:42,829
default so let's look at let's look at

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,750
unmonitored unmonitored services so

00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:51,589
we'll go back up here and we'll do

00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:53,660
unmonitored instead okay look at that

00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:57,079
its dns masquerade it didn't give all

00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,819
the arguments it's running on system 76

00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,440
and its user has been I don't remember

00:58:58,819 --> 00:59:03,890
what undefined is it something that it

00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,900
wasn't said I know it is anyway so it

00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,730
knows that that is so that's a query you

00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,309
can do that says what all services are

00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:12,799
my offering but not monitoring right now

00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:16,369
it didn't list Dropbox because Dropbox

00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:19,279
was listed as never monitor it so let's

00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:25,039
do a couple more queries I still have

00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:27,470
another five or 10 minutes yeah okay so

00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:40,309
let me do it looks like it let's look at

00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:42,859
the all ip's right little is so oh look

00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:46,359
at that you guys are all our ping that's

00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:46,359
your mac addresses and IP addresses

00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:53,000
let's do another one about switches and

00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:57,650
then I'll quit there's just so many more

00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,500
things I could do okay it knows that I'm

00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,490
connected to a procurve 70 and 80 on

01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,859
this machine which is the wired

01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:07,009
connection is connected to this procurve

01:00:03,859 --> 01:00:09,140
switch in port one now that happens to

01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:11,089
be the switch on the floor here so I

01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:13,130
plugged it into a switch and it happens

01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:14,960
to actually cleared the configuration it

01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,279
sends lld betta by default turns I

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,509
probably didn't have to so they're going

01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,200
to have to configure it back sorry about

01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:22,510
that guys

01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:27,109
but but this was discovered that it's an

01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:29,060
818 1810 g with this version of software

01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:29,990
and this version of I don't know what

01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,730
these different things are but their

01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:33,650
version numbers at HP uses in pro curves

01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,690
and I'm on port number one and it

01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:37,339
discovered that automatically I did not

01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:41,089
tell it that it's plugged into that it

01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:44,690
happened automatically so now I'll kind

01:00:41,089 --> 01:00:47,540
of let things go let me we bring up skip

01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:49,310
a couple more slides and miss you and

01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:54,440
then I'll go to and I'll just put up one

01:00:49,310 --> 01:01:01,180
slide yeah that's it I think no that's

01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:03,140
not it apparently let's try that ok so

01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:06,710
I'm going to skip a bunch of other

01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:09,109
things I talked about the IP des

01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,750
practices apparently I didn't backed up

01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:14,720
or something so here's our current

01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,310
status which is you can read basically

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,740
we have a release we just put out a few

01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,970
weeks ago and it does all the things I

01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:23,240
talked about we have quite a few

01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:25,099
discovery methods written a compatible

01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,920
with not just where you saw me use not

01:01:25,099 --> 01:01:29,210
Jos agents so you know I know about them

01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,060
so here's the thing i want to get

01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,339
involved I need people to come to trials

01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:36,260
that to get some kilometers on the

01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:37,760
odometer here right to get more

01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,740
experience with this and more people

01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:44,510
using it and I'm looking for

01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:48,260
contributors of all kinds and I like as

01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:52,010
i said i will be doing a talk we will

01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:53,630
have a something on thursday so come to

01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:57,200
that if you if you're able to count and

01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:58,700
then of course resistance is futile it

01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:04,720
is the assimilation project so now

01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:04,720
questions sorry please raise your hand

01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:18,290
I'm non-native English speakers so maybe

01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:20,900
I just missed it this is a demon that's

01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:23,390
running on each client yes there's an

01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:27,740
agent there's okay we call it a

01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:31,790
nanoprobe and there's a central server

01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:32,780
somewhere on one of the machines now

01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,730
you can set it up with high availability

01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:37,070
failover but yeah there's a central

01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:41,510
server somewhere which these things

01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:45,020
report back to so I'm able to use the

01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:47,570
central server to ask him question about

01:02:45,020 --> 01:03:00,800
my whole topology you suck that's what i

01:02:47,570 --> 01:03:03,050
was doing here ok ok yeah that's it so

01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,940
by the way the person who asked the best

01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,410
question I have I have t-shirts here in

01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:09,350
various sizes whoever has the best

01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:11,240
question gets a t-shirt and it is a very

01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:13,430
geeky t-shirt that says I see dead

01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,810
servers in order one time on the front

01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:19,430
and on the back its it it says

01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:23,120
resistance is futile and has a resistor

01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:26,540
with a circle / over it so it's I'm over

01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,500
time already yeah I gotta go was it one

01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,750
more question can we do one more

01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,030
question or not um so you said these

01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:34,370
nano probes are talking in a ring how do

01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:38,000
neighbors find each other they're told

01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:43,840
by whom the central server all right

01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:46,370
thank you so you mentioned that only

01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:50,060
changes of being reported will that work

01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:52,040
so that's correct when is the deltas

01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,170
calculator is the calculated on the

01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:57,680
machine itself so it yeah keep state

01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,450
itself as well it keeps it doesn't know

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,160
what it means but it knows that the JSON

01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:04,190
is a string compared to the old JSON

01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:07,720
okay you know it's it's level of

01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,720
intelligence is to do a string compare

01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:19,070
which is not rocket science so the last

01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:23,360
question actually those are two

01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:26,690
questions the first one is I no way the

01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:32,140
first one is on which license do you so

01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:34,850
with gplv3 1g gplv3 and the other one is

01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:37,430
how do you want to handle highly dynamic

01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:44,210
data centers like container environments

01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:44,910
so um at this point in time I think any

01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,800
system

01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:48,480
tracks what you're doing is going to

01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,980
have a problem in in a highly dynamic

01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:53,070
data center in terms of scalability

01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,500
that's clearly our most difficult case

01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,330
on the other hand though it's still no

01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,910
worse than any other system to do the

01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:01,200
same thing and it does and people

01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:06,170
actually do leave things running four

01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,170
minutes or hours at a time typically

01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:12,630
they're goot okay thank you very much

01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:16,320
for your time no no the 01 one more one

01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:17,970
one last question I hope so lost

01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:21,180
question is the best question are you a

01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:25,500
fan of the box I'm sorry are you a fan

01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:27,540
of the box assimilation voyager pork oh

01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,210
yeah yeah yeahs Borg yes the board yes

01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,770
yes that's right so I actually have some

01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:35,670
I forgot to put them on but I have some

01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:38,850
some you know some Borg makeup basically

01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:41,480
right so it's in my room I forgot to put

01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:41,480
it on sorry

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,950
now I never remember who asked the best

01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:59,160
question who do you think asked the best

01:05:52,950 --> 01:06:01,109
question please vote but I can't

01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,580
remember the first question I think

01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:07,160
actually I think your question was about

01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:07,160
