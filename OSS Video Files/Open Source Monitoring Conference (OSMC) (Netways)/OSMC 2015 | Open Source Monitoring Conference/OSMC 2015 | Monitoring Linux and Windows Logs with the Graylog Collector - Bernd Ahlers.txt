Title: OSMC 2015 | Monitoring Linux and Windows Logs with the Graylog Collector - Bernd Ahlers
Publication date: 2015-11-26
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Until recently, sending logs to Graylog without using Syslog or any third party program was a bit cumbersome. This has changed since version 1.1. Graylog now has its own log collector which is tightly integrated with the Graylog server and web interface to simplify the management of log shippers.
The Graylog collector runs on several operating systems including Linux, Windows, Mac OS and AIX. It makes it easy to send data like Apache access logs or Windows event logs to Graylog without the need of any third party tools.
In this talk I will introduce the Graylog collector and show how to install and configure it on Linux and Windows. I will also show how to extract structured data from those logs and an example integration with the Icinga monitoring system to alert on critical events.
