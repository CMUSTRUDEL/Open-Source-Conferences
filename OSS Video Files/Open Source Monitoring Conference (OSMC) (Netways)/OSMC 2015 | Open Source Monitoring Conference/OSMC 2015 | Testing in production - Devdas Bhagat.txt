Title: OSMC 2015 | Testing in production - Devdas Bhagat
Publication date: 2015-11-26
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	For most ecommerce companies, software is not the final deliverable product. It is a research tool, to determine what customers will pay for. To be able to get good data from software, monitoring and analytics must be built into the system. Alerting must come from business requirements and be based on application generated data.
In the traditional operations world, we monitor what is easy, and avoid monitoring that which is difficult. This talk is an attempt to show people that monitoring must be driven by metrics from the CxO office, and then potentially involve technical metrics if needed.
This talk explains why functional and business level monitoring is crucial. We also cover the tradeoffs from a DTAP model to continuous deployment. There will be a brief introduction to a couple of useful monitoring tools for functional monitoring. No special technical skills are expected of the audience, but having a general overview of the monitoring world is a good thing. This talk is not limited to ecommerce companies, but is most applicable to that environment.
