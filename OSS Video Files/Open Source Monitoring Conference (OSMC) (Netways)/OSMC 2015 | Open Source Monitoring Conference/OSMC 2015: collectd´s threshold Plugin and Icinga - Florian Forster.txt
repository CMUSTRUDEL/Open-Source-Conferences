Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Capacity planning and monitoring both use system and application performance data. Using the data sampled by collectd at a high frequency allows system engineers to define alerts with short windows while reducing overall system load.
This talk will give a brief introduction to collectd and its "threshold" plugin, including the concepts and configuration involved. It will then explore the different possibilities to combine collectd with Icinga / Nagios and discuss pro and contra of each approach.
