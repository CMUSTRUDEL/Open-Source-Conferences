Title: OSMC 2015 | WhatÂ´s Happening with OpenNMS - Tarus Balog
Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	In 2015, the OpenNMS application was split into two main branches: OpenNMS Horizon and OpenNMS Meridian.
The main reason was to allow for OpenNMS to improve at a more rapid pace. Where it used to take 18-24 months for a new major OpenNMS release, Horizon gets a new major release every 3-4 months.
This model is very similar to the one Red Hat uses, with Horizon being similar to Fedora and Meridian being like Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Also like RHEL, while Meridian is still 100% open source it is only available through a paid subscription.
This talk will discuss the differences between the two version and highlight the new features available in Horizon, such as the Grafana integration, the new Newts.io back end storage model built on Cassandra and the &quot;minion&quot; remote poller that positions OpenNMS to monitor the Internet of Things.

Baylock um as you're already can see he

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:29,360
is from opennms and we you will tell us

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,099
a bit about what's happening with open

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,489
an MS thank you thank you very much

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,200
thanks Toby hi let me see if I can get

00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:38,989
this volume right without scrambling

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,329
anybody um I'm sorry the Balog names

00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:43,489
Hungarian and so I move around and I use

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,320
my hands a lot so I'm going to be

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:46,909
bouncing I know that I have to stay in

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,600
between the two signs and we should be

00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:52,609
good my name is tarick a log I'm one of

00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,030
the maintainer of the open MS project

00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:59,079
how many of you have heard of open an MS

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:02,960
so we have some new people which is good

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,239
open MS was started in 1999 and we did

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,030
our first commit on sourceforge in two

00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,729
thousand so this puts us about the same

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,770
age as nagios nagios was registered on

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,060
sourceforge in january of two thousand

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,860
we were registered in March of two

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,990
thousand and so I'm here today I'm not

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,369
here to give a huge introduction open MS

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,320
but a lot of stuff has been happening

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,750
with the project and I just wanted to

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,060
share it with you I'm also known as the

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,759
mouth of opennms I could quite literally

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,909
talk for the next seven hours and not

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,740
take a break and so I think it was

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,100
strategic that they put me just before

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,140
lunch so that since I also like to eat I

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,619
think that I would definitely finish in

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,140
time for one I have a slide here just

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:52,130
kind of giving you some overview of the

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,140
project um the colonel like the linux

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,600
kernel brags about having thousands and

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,850
thousands of contributors we do not but

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,030
we do have around 50 core people working

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,810
on the project so it is a very active

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,820
project the way it works is a lot of the

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,700
configuration gets updated with each

00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,380
release so out of the box if you point

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,290
open and a message your network and you

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,110
have say SNMP installed you will end up

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,390
getting about 2,000 different objects

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,400
will be data collected and graft and we

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,459
have over 20,000 SNMP

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,370
wraps pre-configured with opennms so a

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,290
lot of work going on with that we've

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,060
since moved even though you can find us

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,970
on sourceforge we're with everybody else

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,010
on github so here's a list of github

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,840
commits over the last five years and as

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,599
you can see it's it's definitely going

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,459
up on average so it's a very very busy

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,739
project so what's happening with opennms

00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,680
i love this conference all i meant to

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,959
point out so you know disneyland may say

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,819
it's the happiest place on earth but i

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,319
think nuremberg is the happiest place on

00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,359
earth because all the buildings even

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,620
smile this is actually up near the

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,139
christmas market i took that picture

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,019
yesterday i really love this conference

00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,700
because it brings together the best of

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,739
open source monitoring I mean you've got

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,900
zabbix you got a single you've got us

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:15,200
you've got all the new stuff we got

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,090
prometheus you've got Bafana and and all

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,849
of these projects are pure open source

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,870
projects and I like that a lot so I was

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:26,180
here last year in November and so what's

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,169
happened since then well right after I

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:34,239
left we release to open an MS 14 soon

00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:36,290
after that we released in horizon 15 in

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,659
February roar this year we released

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,060
meridian now I'm going to explain what

00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:46,159
horizon and meridian mean in in the next

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,629
slide in April we released horizon 16 we

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,349
have an annual developers conference

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:53,389
called def jam we had our 10th

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:55,459
conference so very few projects can

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,010
point to actually having a tenure track

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,109
record this conference can point to

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,790
having a tenure track record and then

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,530
coming up this week I think it's this

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,709
week if not it's the first of next week

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,479
we're releasing horizon 17 so there have

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:13,400
been a lot of releases of opennms now I

00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:17,030
work for a company called the opennms

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,190
group and we do services and support

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,720
around the open intimates project that's

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,479
how we make money that's how we're able

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,610
to keep opennms running we have a

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,250
bizarre business model it's called spend

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,950
less money than you earn now that sounds

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,750
crazy but it's kept us around for quite

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,130
some time well running a support biz

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,710
writing the services business can be

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,680
difficult and we were trying to solve a

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,830
couple of problems one problem we were

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,160
trying to solve is how can we release

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,110
open and a mess more quickly we had been

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,930
doing a stable open and Mercer release

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,750
every 18 months a year and a half which

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,340
is a long time but the problem is i run

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,280
a support business so if I'm churning

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,820
the code a lot that makes a lot of extra

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,850
work for me and my team so we adopted

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,550
the Red Hat model and I'm talking about

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,610
this today because I want to stress that

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,670
both versions of opennms are one hundred

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,010
percent open source versions so as most

00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,720
of you know Red Hat probably has the

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,880
best open source business model out

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,030
there there are 15 billion dollar

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,250
company and pretty much every piece of

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,230
code they write is open source that's

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,240
why we have sent us Santos is able to

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,930
take Red Hat's code pull out all the

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,000
trademarks recompile it sell it in its

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,600
function for function identical to Red

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,490
Hat Enterprise Linux so we split open

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,230
and a mess into two versions so we have

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,540
a version now called meridian that is

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,240
the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version and

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,310
we have a version called horizon which

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,190
is the Fedora version and that's why

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,460
we've had four major releases of opennms

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,140
in a year because of the split most of

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,690
our support customers are moving to

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,940
Meridian and that is more of a once a

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,000
yearly cycle we call it Meridian 2015

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:11,420
but it's kind of hard to get this across

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,230
in a slide and I'm as people who do know

00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,760
me I hate like the open core model where

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,960
here's a little bit this open source but

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,340
if you want all these cool features

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,950
you've got to pay us money just like a

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,140
proprietary software company so I wanted

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,880
to stress that's not the plan we do

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,460
charge for access to the meridian code

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,660
but once you own it pictures you can

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,710
distribute it you can do what you want

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:37,700
with it enough of that why did we do

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,530
this Red Hat um I actually got a meeting

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,660
with Jim Whitehurst last year I have a

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,840
man crush on Jim Whitehurst he is like

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,760
the greatest nicest man you'll ever meet

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,560
he came from Delta he came from airline

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,550
industry and he runs the world's largest

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,550
open source company

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,250
but I took this picture last Wednesday

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,410
and their market cap is close to 15

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,540
billion dollars and there's still a pure

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,850
open source company and that's what we

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:06,290
strive to be as well a 15 billion now

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm just kidding um so what came in

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:13,030
opennms opennms 14 which we released

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,140
last year well one of the things that I

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:20,630
point out first we actually have

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,870
documentation now I know it sounds

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,850
strange but we do it's not perfect but

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,330
it is so much better than was this is an

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:31,610
actual screenshot of the page concerning

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,190
our DCP monitor so we've got little

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,470
pictures we've got examples we've got

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,660
code examples and you can go to docs

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,270
dopin invest org and actually see

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,370
documentation it's written in ASCII doc

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,730
it's compiled right along with every

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,980
release of opennms so if you're trying

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:53,740
to get started with opennms you now have

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:58,070
a few more tools to help you do that now

00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,380
we also change the license oban Emma's

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:04,040
had been published under the GPL version

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:08,360
3 we switched to the affero GPL version

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,280
3 mainly we saw a lot of people in our

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,840
IRC chat I don't say a lot but a number

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,360
of new people would show up in our IRC

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,600
channel and they were obviously trying

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,670
to find a way to monetize open and a

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,770
mess as a service like they were going

00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,620
to brand it put open a mess out there

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,650
and charge people for it without sharing

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,420
the code we don't believe in that so we

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,010
asked our community what should we do

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,390
about this and one of our community

00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,970
members said we should switch the

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,370
license to the affero GPL which closes

00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,110
that loophole it's the the main reason

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,690
we do that so just wanted to bring that

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,440
up now open MS meridian is available

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:47,480
under the a GPL one of our customers I I

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,950
can I'm being recorded so I'm not going

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,830
to say the names of our customers you

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,020
can ask us you can ask me privately but

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,690
one of them just they won't allow any a

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,280
GPL software so i went to Aaron

00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,870
Williamson who used to work for the

00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,180
software freedom law center he's our

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,960
lawyer and I said hey I want to write up

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,680
a proprietary

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,060
license that's exactly like the a GPL

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,310
gives you all the rights except you

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,010
can't just you can't make a service out

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,450
of it and so you can choose that license

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,940
and that's enabled us to get a few

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:22,550
customers who wouldn't normally choose

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:26,720
the a GPL um now how many of you like

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,400
Network maps I'll come on you've got at

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,660
least have a boss is like I want to see

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,030
the map I want to see like where the

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,850
space shuttle is in JPL and stuff like

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,790
that because we must got that I hate

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,280
maps um there was a time in my life

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,020
where I was having to do work with

00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,020
network node manager and all I did for

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,250
ours was drag objects into containers on

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,530
maps and I really wanted to kill myself

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:56,030
however opennms has some pretty cool

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:59,660
maps now starting with open and ms 14 we

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:02,000
have a topology map so we discover using

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,310
a thing called enhanced lengthy we

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,290
discover links layer 2 links between

00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,390
devices now of course I had an outage

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,460
here Ike is actually my soda machine

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,650
this is a little slow cuz all you guys

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,410
were downloading torrents last night but

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:18,200
um Ike is a soda machine that I monitor

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,670
so when I sell sodas we actually keep

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,820
track of how many cokes have been sold

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,290
and stuff we drink way too much but what

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,180
this enables you to do is actually

00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,130
migrate through the network at layer 2

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,740
and the more objects you bring in you'll

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,110
see here's this SSH Alvin just cleared

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,480
on here while I did that otherwise you'd

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,190
see a little icon over here you can

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,490
change the layout you can change the

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,560
format etc so it's kind of cool and this

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,680
is designed to show you relationships at

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,800
a layer to level the topology is

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,020
actually an API and what we have is if

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,070
you happen to use vSphere if you use

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,380
VMware you can see a vmware topology so

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,360
you can actually go in here and see your

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,890
network attached storage you can see

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,740
your host machines you can see your

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,020
guest machines juniper is actually

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,480
developing an API plug-in to show all

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,250
the pvcs through their network so we're

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,500
hoping that as opening that's matures

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,700
the topology API will mature along with

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,460
it and we'll have a bunch of other

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,670
plugins

00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,850
now the other type of map we have is a

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:25,430
geographical map so it shows you your

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,720
locations and we use the tiles provided

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,780
by openstreetmap but you can use

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,980
mapquest you can use google as you can

00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,160
see if you mouse over here to show you

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,500
the area you get um this is a group it

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,510
says there's nine devices in here most

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,360
of them are green as you zoom in you'll

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,130
see things split out so all the devices

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,470
split out that little too that's my

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:48,200
house so I'm monitoring two nodes in my

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,050
house and if you drill down it'll show

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,120
you what the current status of these

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,640
devices are and here's your alarms here

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,800
if you happen to zoom out what will end

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,900
up happening is you'll always see these

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,180
things kind of group in together usually

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,700
it like the state or county or district

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,590
level if there's only one device you'll

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,960
get the little pin like up there near

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,700
Portland we have a server up there but

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,030
there's only one server so it shows up

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,610
as a nice little pin so again it's

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:18,920
really good for those JPL maps where the

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,030
boss wants to see a design of what's

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:26,330
going on on the network we also added in

00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,740
14 this idea of ops boards I should have

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,790
made a video for this but I just learned

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,400
how to do it so I didn't this allows you

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,160
to create screens that you would put up

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,290
at a knock that rotate so you could have

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,020
your alarm list you could have an alarm

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,160
summary you could have something from a

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:48,110
news website and these can rotate and so

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,110
one of the nice things is cool about the

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,840
ops board is that you can set up events

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,820
where it'll change the priority so let's

00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,790
say you have an alarm a critical alarm

00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:03,500
pops up it can increase the priority of

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,030
that board it'll show up more often so

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,000
let's say everything has a priority of

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,070
three what in so if you get bored one

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,840
board to board three board one board to

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,030
board three if we get in the critical

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,420
alarm you get bored one or two board one

00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,090
board 3421 so something interesting

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:25,790
there again trying to get information

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:27,860
out to people who can use it now in the

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,740
open and a mess 15

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,459
in open MS 15 we focused on one thing

00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,560
the web user interface our web user

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,720
interface is not the prettiest thing in

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,130
the world the maps I showed you is

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,220
probably the first thing we've done in

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:49,279
years to make them pretty the technology

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,130
that we use was again from 1999 we ended

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,899
up migrating the entire web UI to a

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,860
technology called bootstrap and

00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:00,170
bootstrap is a very responsive web

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:04,700
interface so that you can shrink and

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:07,490
large the screens we ended up having to

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,269
touch every piece of the web UI so this

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:13,820
is like the normal web UI if you were to

00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:18,079
scrunch in this they would line up in

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:22,640
order this is the same webpage on my

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:25,329
phone so as you can see it's all very

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,220
very useful to interchange between

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:32,480
different technologies different devices

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:35,300
etc now one of the reasons that we

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,720
haven't in the past focused too much on

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,170
the web UI is that the vast majority of

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,920
our large customers don't use it opennms

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:48,800
has a very strong REST API and so

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,290
usually what happens is that customers

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,570
will have their own internal system they

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,510
will make rest calls to open an MS to

00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:01,399
both provision opennms get alarms delete

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:03,320
things etc so the other half of 15 was

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:08,209
we really beefed up the rest interface

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:10,850
as well so this enables us a very high

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:14,540
level of integration with a bunch of

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:18,199
different tools so open and s14 was

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,670
mainly on our maps and enhanced link be

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:29,180
open as 15 focused on the web UI so

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:32,180
what's cool in opening a mess 16 compass

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,680
and I have actually we have the compass

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,240
logo which I don't have on the screen

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
here but we have stickers so I know

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,430
everyone like stickers this is the

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,230
compass logo right there compass is our

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,390
new mobile app

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,360
so it's free you can get it on iOS and

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:51,470
you can get on Android this may be the

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,170
direction of the opennms web UI we use a

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,990
technology called I think it's called

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,330
iconic of ionic is the library which

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,350
enables us to write once and publish to

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,090
both iOS and Android this is a really

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,280
really cool tool you should check it out

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,860
especially if they open mms the only

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,050
downside is from your phone you need to

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,280
be able to talk to open an MS so you

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,200
either have to have a whole three or

00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,050
firewall or you've got out of a VPN

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,670
that's the main downside of it but you

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,400
can see your alarms you can see your

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,040
outages one of the cool things is if you

00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,600
remember the map you can set the

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,990
coordinates for your device from your

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,060
phone so if you're at a remote site or

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,580
if you're in your server room you can

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,640
pull out your phone you can hit set

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:39,380
coordinates and it'll go ahead and it

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,250
will set the longitude and latitude of

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,530
that device on the map the other thing

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,510
that we can do with the latest version

00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,420
of compass you get at multiple servers

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,100
so we have to hear demo and internal if

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,870
you switch from internal which is a

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,870
meridian server to demo which is a

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,750
rising server the colors will change so

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,630
now it's all green one of the things we

00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,860
added in compass was the ability to

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:08,810
favorite graphs so this little movie

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,680
here is actually demonstrating how you

00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:14,570
can go through different nodes pick out

00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,600
which graph you want you hard it you

00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,930
basically put the little star next to it

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:23,660
it'll bring it up you can mix and match

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,360
so i can take cpu utilization I can take

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,120
load averages the other thing that

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,050
opennms collects is latency data so

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,790
here's a load average when we do a poll

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,770
we collect the time we do the pole the

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,470
moment the pol returns we grab the time

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,630
again we store that in a file and so we

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,000
can determine how long it's taking us to

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,640
say access a web page and you can of

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,990
course threshold that as well and if you

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,030
threshold that you can get an alert

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,170
before you have an outage you can get an

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,300
alert when the threshold is getting

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,950
close now you come to your favorited

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,539
graphs and you can just swipe through

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,549
them

00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,679
and you can see all your favorite at

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,720
graphs you can also change the time

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,309
series so you can change the start and

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,710
stop time all this from your phone you

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,539
can be down at the pub and you can be

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,789
having a beer and you can be checking on

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,999
your cpu utilization you can change the

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:15,700
time range etc again all of this is free

00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:20,529
and it's part of the opennms compass

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,899
product this got us a bossy infoworld

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,690
has a best of open source software

00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:28,239
awards and this is the screenshot from

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,820
the bossy page and as you can see they

00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:32,200
really highlighted compass because it

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,149
puts the power of your network

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,149
management system right in your hand

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,779
another thing did anyone go to torque

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,659
holds Gravano talk so this morning

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:49,210
torkoal did a Gravano talk we integrate

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,489
with Griffin so we act as a group on the

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,739
data source you can enable it you can

00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:56,139
point Gravano at open and a mess and you

00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:58,269
can gather all this data have multiple

00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:01,179
instances of opennms you can put

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:02,559
multiple instances on one page and if

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:07,659
you haven't played with Gravano it is a

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:11,229
really really cool system we have been

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:13,679
worried about trying to visualize all

00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:16,509
the data that open MS can collect and

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,629
the Griffin I integration really enables

00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:21,669
us to do that we went to a trade show

00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:23,619
the Wi-Fi here hasn't been bad if anyone

00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,940
had just really bad problems with the

00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:30,399
Wi-Fi the VLAN I'm surprised most trade

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,289
shows i go to it's just dead you end up

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,989
getting a thousand geeks in a hotel and

00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,509
it's just like it's dead we went to a

00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:39,940
conference called self the southeastern

00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,999
linux fest and we set up graph on ax to

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,519
monitor their network and so here's all

00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:48,070
the different access points here and how

00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,690
many people were loaded in we're

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,299
tracking the number of people associated

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,769
with each access point as well and we

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,489
had a booth we actually had a booth

00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:59,710
itself and i love booth duty we call it

00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:02,080
sitting in a booth in talking people but

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,970
it can get old because you're there for

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,129
like eight hours a day for two days and

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,989
so on the last day we all wanted to go

00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,159
home so we looked at the number of

00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:11,320
people connected

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,570
to the to the Wi-Fi when it dropped

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,789
below 50 we left because everybody else

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,619
was leaving and so he said if there are

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,859
less than 50 people connected to the

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:22,720
VLAN then we're going to leave but again

00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:25,419
getting this stuff set up is just very

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,519
very easy and so if you need a

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:33,519
visualization tool I strongly recommend

00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:36,970
you look at Griffin ax so opennms 14 we

00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,779
were talking about maps open in us 15

00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:44,289
we've got an entirely new web interface

00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:47,229
structure in 16 we've got graphing we've

00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:50,950
got compass what's coming and open an

00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:54,999
immense 17 so open MS 17 is coming out I

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:57,129
believe it's next week we're aiming to

00:20:54,999 --> 00:21:00,359
be the de facto platform for the

00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:02,979
internet of things we can monitor

00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,619
millions if not billions of devices and

00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:08,470
we want to be the platform that people

00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:12,909
choose one of the problems we have with

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,950
this is performance data storage we use

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,049
our detail as our back-end a lot of

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,970
people cacti I almost probably everyone

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,349
in here who's done anything with network

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,629
management has been exposed to our

00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:24,580
detour the problem is it's great tool I

00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:26,950
mean it's graph it does great graphing

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,889
it's very compact but it doesn't scale

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:34,720
so we were like trying to figure out how

00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:38,229
can we scale to literally billions and

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,440
billions and billions of devices well we

00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:44,440
came up with a project called newts you

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,109
can read about it here newts I oh this

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,229
is our cool crowd-sourced logo get it

00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:55,989
new newts is a time-series database

00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:57,009
built upon Apache Cassandra how many

00:21:55,989 --> 00:22:01,419
here are familiar with the Apache

00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:03,759
Cassandra project a few hands it was

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:06,159
invented by Facebook and contributed to

00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,229
Apache both newts and Cassandra are

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,830
Apache licensed so it's a very

00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:14,109
permissive license the guy worked for me

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,200
who was the principal architect of nudes

00:22:14,109 --> 00:22:18,879
he left I don't have many people quit on

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,830
me I've had to fire a few people but I

00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,870
haven't had any people quit on me but he

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,850
went to work for mediawiki

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,540
and since I can't make a blog post

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,830
without a Wikipedia article i really

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,880
don't blame him i think he's having a

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,559
very very good time but because

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,870
mediawiki uses a pat it uses cassandra a

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,580
lot we're getting contributions so we

00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,910
have contribution from outside of the

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,860
open and in this project on newts

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:47,680
cassandra is massively scalable we have

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,470
a three node cassandra instance in our

00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,059
lab and it's hard for us to keep it busy

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:58,000
that's just how fast this thing is and

00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,620
it's you can have multiple instances in

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,780
one location you can also distribute

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,360
them across the world and it will

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,130
replicate its masterless it's just a

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,350
wonderful wonderful piece of open-source

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,900
technology you put a time series

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:13,450
database on it and you've really got

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,270
something because now we can store tons

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,820
of data and you can keep it pretty much

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,450
as long as you want the other thing is

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,340
now we store the raw value one of the

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,960
complaints people have about our dito is

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,610
it does averaging I don't know if

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:32,350
anyone's ever run into that but we store

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,070
the raw value and then you can use

00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,260
whatever smoothing function you want

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:40,000
afterwards you could use graph on up as

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,520
torkoal was showing you can choose

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,200
different functions to apply to the data

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:51,280
and so that's what's going on with newts

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:54,070
now the issue we have is that we use our

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:58,809
dito our dito also provides our graphs

00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:01,090
so just having the the data in a

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:03,550
different storage doesn't help us it was

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,770
funny the first go we had at this we

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,740
would actually go to newts grab the data

00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:13,240
dump it in an RD file and then display

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:15,340
it so instead of doing that forever this

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,440
is this picture on the right here is

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:21,160
your standard rd graph for system memory

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,130
stats we've written a JavaScript library

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,770
called back shift and what back shift

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,460
allows you to do is to take time series

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:34,630
data and display it and we use the same

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,290
exact syntax so if you've been used to

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,570
doing our detour graphs

00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,090
you can actually do the same thing in

00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:44,230
back shift and you get graphs like this

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:48,610
and as you can see they're pretty close

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:51,920
um what you can't do with our d tool is

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,660
you're not over a mouse over so with the

00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,700
back shift if you mouse over you'll get

00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,740
a little pop-up that tells you what the

00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:03,260
value is and what the the two data

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,390
points are the time series on the x-axis

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,280
and the y-axis and if you migrate

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,630
between it's pretty sensitive and you

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,160
can migrate between each of those

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,080
different things so if you've ever

00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,940
wondered what that peak was you can now

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,550
look or you can also look at the raw

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,310
data something that was not easy to do

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,050
with our d tool all of this is from the

00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,540
back shift library that comes in open an

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:28,310
MS 17 and this works with our d tool

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:33,290
ordinates so it's another cool graphing

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:34,760
aspect of it I was thinking I usually

00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:40,550
run long but I'm going to run a little

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,380
short today opennms 18 this is the next

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,680
version of open MS we hope to have it

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,250
out in the spring of next year now as I

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:52,100
mentioned our goal is Internet of Things

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,490
so we've got our we've got the storage

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:59,390
back end so what's coming in 8 and 18

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:01,190
well we have a project called minion now

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,050
I was just informed that minion is being

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,570
used by a number of different people I

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,980
will claim I was the first to use it in

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,380
network management because I came up

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,410
with this term about 20 years ago and

00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,450
the idea was a minion would be one of

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,330
these little processes that would go out

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,120
and do some localized management so we

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,400
collect events it would collect data it

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,740
would process traps it would do service

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,980
monitoring and it would forward that up

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,110
to some sort of central console and I

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,250
called that central console Dominion

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:37,100
because it has dominion over the minions

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,900
so um but really saltstack uses minion

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,500
now so i don't think this will be the

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,930
go-to-market name for it our project

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,080
original project name was called snip 0

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,880
which was opennms backwards and since we

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,190
have a lot of people in Germany working

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,139
on the

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,860
project they pointed out that schnitzel

00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:59,490
and potatoes so every time I look at

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:02,250
this makes me hungry but one of the

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,889
things that I really love about open

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,379
source and I dislike about the kind of

00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:11,250
open open source we call it kind of the

00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:12,450
fake open source is um I remember there

00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,519
was a I'm not going to name names

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,190
because I'm trying to have to be caddy

00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:18,720
in my old age but there was a company

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:23,009
that's like come to this trade show and

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,759
we'll unveil the new stuff in our open

00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:28,889
source project unlike unveil open source

00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,830
I mean don't you just it's open source

00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:34,230
so shouldn't it just be there and so you

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,450
can actually go if you google open an MS

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,250
minion you can it'll take you to the

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,470
github project and you can see the code

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:45,470
so minion uses something called osgi an

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,659
osgi is a technology that lets us

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,480
dynamically change out bits and pieces

00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,730
of the process without having to restart

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,649
it there's a project called open

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,289
daylight that's dealing with Software

00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:02,129
Defined networks and network feature

00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:06,389
virtualization opendaylight uses osgi

00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:08,820
and so um the idea is once the minion

00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:12,360
and my target hardware platform for the

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,870
minion is rett as a PI 2 so the idea is

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,909
on really consumer-grade low-end

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,940
commodity hardware you can put these

00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:23,190
everywhere what I told the guys was i

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:26,039
showed you on the geographical map that

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,559
little too or my my house is i want to

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,269
be able to stick a minion in my house go

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,490
to a web page and be able to do

00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:36,470
everything that i normally could do

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:39,750
through an open and ms GUI through the

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:42,899
through the minion as if i had installed

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,659
open and ms right there on the box and

00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:49,679
we're close we're really close because

00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:51,480
we really want to get to this so there's

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,730
been talk about making the banana swoosh

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,129
like the default solution of an immense

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,259
and yes I stole I did not license these

00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:00,899
little characters from from Warner

00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:03,660
Brothers or 27 I who forget who did

00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:06,000
despicable me but the

00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,400
is that as the Internet of Things comes

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,520
about we're going to need to have lots

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,110
and lots and lots of collection stations

00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,080
so if we can combine minion with

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,080
centralized deployment management along

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,740
with the Cassandra newts back in we

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,770
should really be able to have unlimited

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:29,310
network management capabilities now have

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,840
a final little movie here one of the

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,270
things that has always bothered me about

00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,860
certain open source projects is it's

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:40,800
very hard to use like they may

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,180
distribute it via tarball and so when

00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,650
every new version comes out you have to

00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,110
get a new tarball and then you have to

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,350
to backport your configuration changes I

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,900
mean get helps a lot with this but you

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,510
know I like rpms and I like just to be

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,830
able to install rpms we make a

00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:01,950
repository for every single branch in

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,570
our github public repository so here are

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:07,140
all the different branches and we

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,820
support it for fedora for red hat you

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,650
can you could download the sniper branch

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,750
you could download them or the minyan

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,970
branch and use it and every day that we

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,340
had a commit you could download and

00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,590
follow this right along it is so

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,030
incredibly simple I mean look how small

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:23,520
this little thing is I'm just dragging

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,720
through all the different branches that

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,260
we have it open in a mess right now

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,120
because we truly want to be an

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,400
open-source platform and we want people

00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,590
using our experimental stuff we want

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,540
people playing with this thing and so we

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:41,550
don't hide anything so there's no

00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:45,080
unveiling there's no we're not so you

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:50,430
can play with this even as we speak so

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,440
in conclusion while i'm here with zabbix

00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,900
and with a single and everything we

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,570
started out with our statement being we

00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,790
want to be the default network

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,320
management standard we would like to be

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:03,210
the network management platform of

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,340
choice which means we integrate with

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,770
tons of things both proprietary and open

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,710
source and that's our goal whether or

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,680
not we succeed I don't know but I have

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,960
two rules as we try to reach this

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,730
mission opennms will always be free

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,649
there's not going to be an enterprise

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,929
version there's not going to be an extra

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:25,240
version every piece of code that we

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:27,070
write that we call opennms will always

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,890
be free and the second thing is I don't

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,419
want open animist ever suck I don't want

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,760
to be here next year going well we just

00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,340
had open in the mess 20 because I wanted

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,880
to release something 40 smc not because

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:44,049
it was ready so again we try very very

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,350
hard not to make opennms suck so on go

00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:50,580
to www ms org you can check out the

00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:55,870
project we have Debian packages we have

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,600
sent us redhead packages and if if

00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,520
scalability is kind of something that

00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,669
you're concerned about you may want to

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:08,080
look to open an MS for that answer this

00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:11,049
is me so you can always email me tarus

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,840
or open MS torg the social network I use

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,149
the most is google plus because it's

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,940
only geeks the only people who were on

00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:21,159
it it's like my sister's not on it I

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,350
have lots of great conversation google+

00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,779
I do have a Twitter account I don't

00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,510
tweet very much I usually tweet when I

00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:30,490
post to one of my blogs and I tweet when

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,710
I'm mad about something because I found

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,010
that if you tweet to like Marriott they

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:40,870
sometimes answer you back Facebook right

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:44,710
don't do the facebook my open source web

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,720
site is adventures in OSS com I have a I

00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,909
used to put lots of weird stuff they're

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,279
like reviews of science fiction novels

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:53,200
and movies I have since moved that to

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,960
tourists I oh because all the cool kids

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,990
have I Oh addresses and I'm a cool kid

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,000
so I also have a hobby where I make

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,559
classic cocktails so anyway I just

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,029
throwing that out here because I do

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,270
believe there will be a small amount of

00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:09,610
drinking tonight so if you haven't been

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,710
here before just be prepared those of

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:15,820
you who have been know what I'm talking

00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:17,500
about so anyway that's it for me um are

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:22,120
there any questions we do have a

00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:24,760
microphone and if we have please just

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,590
give me a second to to reach you so what

00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,179
I really want you guys to do is try and

00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,530
get the you know this side of the room

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:31,540
so someone in the back

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:34,600
ask the next question so we can get Toby

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,880
running back and forth here hi my name

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,960
is Dennis I'm the last time I've seen

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:45,700
open and s it was I think version 18 or

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,880
19 and what yeah basically battled me

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,770
the most what people like about the less

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,090
sophisticated monitoring systems like

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:57,700
mooning or nagios is that plugins are so

00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:00,550
easy to write if I have some obscure

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,230
piece of software i can just put out a

00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:05,200
shell script monitoring the state of

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,450
this obscure software I'm just

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,120
integrated into my monitoring system I

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,820
couldn't find a way to do this easily in

00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,950
opening the mess is this going to change

00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,360
we hope to we hope to we actually have

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,300
something I haven't covered in this

00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,100
which is we're actually building like a

00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,200
little marketplace so that people can

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,240
write plugins and put them out there so

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,070
that will entail having an easier way to

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,950
do this opening a message written in

00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:33,540
Java and I didn't make that decision

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:36,490
usually that gets at least one grown ja

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:38,980
but then there's people I'm in go I'm

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,890
like okay but I don't care as long as it

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:44,230
works what I when I teach the open MS

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:46,120
class the way we answer the question of

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,070
basically let's let's let's be frank

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,980
it's a nagios check script how do i get

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:53,800
a now here's check strip into open and a

00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:56,110
mess well we do support nrpe so if you

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,600
have n RP out there that's fine but what

00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,930
I am a big fan boy of the net-snmp

00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:04,840
project and net-snmp has a command

00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:08,560
called extend and what extent does is

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:11,260
run local scripts so what I tell people

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,330
to do is if you have a check script or

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,640
something you want to run install

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:18,070
net-snmp on your server set up your

00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,410
check scripts on the server and then

00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,540
it's very very simple to configure open

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,070
an immense to a discover that that

00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:27,910
script is supported on that particular

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:30,130
device and be executed and so that's

00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,440
what I end up telling people to do there

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,730
is a general purpose plugin that is

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,560
literally what you're talking about

00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,750
where you spawn a shell and you run a

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,400
script we just found that in scalability

00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,300
having to do a shet a fork exec and run

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,180
a shell and run

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,430
script every single time x 1000 2000

00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:52,810
3000 servers it just didn't scale for us

00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:57,190
did that help at all yeah but basically

00:35:52,810 --> 00:36:00,100
the trouble with using SNMP is you have

00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,530
to come up with a lip maybe or at least

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,960
no ID you are going to use you have to

00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:08,320
configure it on the local node and on

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,450
the central monitoring server so that's

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,800
a bit cumbersome well if you're going to

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,510
if you're going to use the check script

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,730
that uses ssh where you've got to

00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,010
configure keys on both sides of that as

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,200
well there's it's a trade-off the

00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,050
beautiful part about medicine please

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,780
extend agent is we do a thing called

00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:29,170
it's a class example and call it class

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:33,220
monitor and the instance of the class

00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:36,490
monitor script is actually the word

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,310
class monitor so it's a ski for see a

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,020
ski 4 l.a ski for a as and it's in

00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:45,160
dotted decimal notation so it's really

00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:48,790
easy to know what the names of all these

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,190
different scripts are I do it I use it

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,460
for everything so I'm one of the people

00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,750
who manages our internal network and

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,800
every so often something will go wrong

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:03,220
on my network that I didn't foresee like

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,500
at one point in time we have we have a

00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,870
server in the office it's kind of call

00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,390
it like the Vanity server so if you have

00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,640
a domain domain name and you want to

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,980
host it you can just host it on our

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,840
server so we have an Apache instance and

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,990
everything like that well we had a guy

00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,540
who worked for us who had his his family

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,610
domain on our server and he wanted to

00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:28,000
forward mail to his daughters he had

00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:30,730
three daughters Carrie Renee and Emily

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,060
and so I just you know male would come

00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,260
in I would forward it out to their

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,580
Google account or something like that oh

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:40,120
it's actually their time warner account

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,920
well as young girls or want to do they

00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,990
visited a lot of websites they weren't

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,880
super careful about their username and

00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:48,100
pass our their email address it got

00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,610
harvested so they were getting a lot of

00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,800
spam so Time Warner thought I was a spam

00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,450
relay because they're monitoring I'm

00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,190
getting a lot of spam from this address

00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,220
even though it was targeted even though

00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:02,200
only email going to these three ladies

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,770
it was a spam relay so Time Warner said

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:09,490
no more mail for you pic and so suddenly

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:13,839
my mail queue got huge we could not send

00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:15,490
mail to time warner so i ran the Melk

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,540
you command and i could tell how many

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:19,240
men there's like eight hundred messages

00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,670
queued up so i wrote a little script

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,089
that i plugged in the SNMP that it just

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,680
reported the number of messages in lq

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:29,020
just returned to you know basically

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,220
return that number and then i wrote a

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,589
monitor and open unless all

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,390
configuration took me maybe maybe four

00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:36,940
or five minutes and it basically said

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:39,490
hey if if this exists on this server

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,349
account and if it's greater than 300 min

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,740
and then the service is down you know it

00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:47,560
violates the threshold another thing i

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,089
do is many years ago we got attacked by

00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,130
script kiddies i think there was a

00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:53,980
vulnerability and apache or something

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,560
that we had not patched because i only

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,540
managed like 30-40 servers but that's a

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,490
lot and you kind of forget oh crap i

00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,950
need to do run yum update or apt get

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:05,230
update on these servers so i have a

00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:08,770
script that runs every hour through a

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:11,410
cron job that goes and does a test so

00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,869
it'll go out and say how many packages

00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,730
need to be updated and I store that in a

00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:18,880
file and I just print that for that

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,770
number out via SNMP and so the service

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,410
does the service check is is this value

00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,420
0 if it is the service is up if that

00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,460
value is anything other than 0 it marks

00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,810
the service is down I get an email and I

00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,390
go and make sure that I update the

00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,190
server and so that's how I do special

00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,770
checks and I'm do almost everything

00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,890
through net SP what are we going to do

00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,390
about Windows servers um what are we

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,130
going to fall under your windows service

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,000
you can start by getting rid of windows

00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:48,310
servers no I'm just kidding we do wmi

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,960
checks I mean you can you can do data

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,810
collection via wmi you can do data

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,460
collection via HTML like what I do for

00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:58,060
my soda machine is I want to write an

00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:01,329
SMP a true SMP extension for my soda

00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,450
machine but I don't have time so what I

00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:06,040
do is I just dumped a file so i talked

00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,900
to my soda machine and i'd say okay give

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,260
me your inventory list and it's this

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,940
weird protocol called decks

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,830
it gives me this list out and then I use

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,110
a regular expression just to grep ok

00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,790
thats lot 10 I've sold so many drinks

00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,010
that's lot 11 I've sold so many drinks

00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,710
and then I use our HTTP collector to go

00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:25,650
to a website web page so it's like what

00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,560
I internal node openness or / drinks

00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,000
text which lives in the web root and

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,320
then I parse all those values and then I

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,270
do threshold checking based on that

00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,180
windows servers are an interesting case

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,790
you know how do you I'm not sure how do

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,900
you manage it with with a singer or

00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:44,790
nagios a windows yeah well we talked to

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,680
Anna's client so we have an NS plant

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,420
plugin so if you like and his client

00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,490
plus plus you can actually just

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,810
configure NS client plus plus an open MS

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,000
will run that check script through in

00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:58,530
its client so yeah we're trying to you

00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,560
know i'm here at what's what used to be

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:05,360
called the nagios conference so we do we

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,360
do support a lot of the nagios plugins

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:13,650
any other questions no one hates java de

00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:16,200
who hates Java come on got it someone's

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,820
gotta hate Java it actually works I mean

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,860
one of our customers are you know we

00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,440
have telecom customers and all of their

00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,300
tools tend to be written in Java and so

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,030
we're able to talk to jboss and do some

00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,520
integrations at that level but but

00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:37,820
anyway um we serve a few more minutes

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:42,060
but that's far hi hi i'm interested in

00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:45,240
in the in the in the name of opennms own

00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,240
network monitoring so responsible for

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,130
network monitoring in our company do you

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,750
have any recommendation how to start

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:56,880
with your project in on network like

00:41:53,750 --> 00:42:00,390
8000 device from cisco juniper brocade

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,520
different manufacturer different routing

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:08,190
protocols ospf enhancer GOP is bgp a lot

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,550
of layer to stuff like spanning tree so

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:15,060
just install and enable outer discovery

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,490
or do you have any best practices or

00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,200
recommendation for this yeah that's you

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,030
think I would have an easy answer for

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,950
that you know like how do I get starting

00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,090
with open and a mess well we do have a

00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,700
tutorial on the website

00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,680
getting it installed but I'm actually

00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,360
working on a series of videos to help

00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,240
people get started but basically you

00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,360
install it I would make sure that you

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,660
have SMP configured on these juniper and

00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,950
cisco devices and then if you just point

00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,210
opennms at it either through

00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,990
auto-discovery or through our

00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,730
provisioning system you get it you'll

00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,220
get an idea of what open MS does

00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,590
especially those two particular devices

00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,590
cisco and juniper devices from those

00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:57,390
vendors we support them very strongly so

00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,650
you're going to be getting memory

00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,290
statistics you're going to be getting

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:03,030
cpu utilization temperatures all those

00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,210
thresholds everything's going to kind of

00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,830
work out of the box and that's the thing

00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:10,020
about open MS it does a lot out of the

00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:13,380
box but it really shines when you start

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,090
to customize it but there's a there's an

00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,450
investment I keep telling people it's

00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:19,530
free software it's not a free solution

00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:21,690
because i keep getting questions on the

00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:24,210
mailing list it's like okay how do you

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,680
fix my network now like i can't help you

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:29,790
with that i can give you the tools that

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,780
you can use to help it but that's kind

00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,990
of a that's our bread and butter

00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:37,170
actually is around around the seven to

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:39,150
eight thousand device range and again

00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,100
all of the layer two stuff will

00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,080
automatically be discovered and the way

00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,270
we do it is SNMP so we look at the

00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,340
various we look at the bridging table is

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,500
one of the places but there's all these

00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,630
specialized tables for both juniper and

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,400
cisco that we look at so you'll be able

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,290
to see the interconnectivity between the

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,000
two of them and the topology map is

00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:59,160
really cool because you can actually add

00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,740
focuses so you can focus on two

00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,740
disparate I mean my network is tiny and

00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,020
if i zoom out on our map right now you

00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,760
can't it's just little dots it's not

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,710
very useful so what we do with the

00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,150
topology map was allow you to focus on

00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,640
different devices and see the

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,680
relationship between those two areas of

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,400
your network versus trying to do the

00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,890
whole thing but to get started the wiki

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,160
so open MS org go to the install

00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:29,460
tutorial pointed at your system and and

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,680
and then we have as I said a very strong

00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,420
community most of it involves our

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,780
mailing list so we have a mailing list

00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,950
called the open and ms discuss list it's

00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,050
hosted by sourceforge

00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,839
go to the wiki and type in mailing list

00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:45,630
you'll see it and it's very friendly if

00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,810
you ask a decent question you know we

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:51,470
have a we have a this one guy years ago

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:53,250
wrote in he's like opennms does not work

00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,710
I've done everything I've tried

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,140
everything it doesn't work and here i am

00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,520
i'm at the office it's like nine o'clock

00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,260
at night i'm the only one in the

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,500
building and i'm sitting here you know

00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,230
working with my customers an impasse

00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:10,470
reply and I Rebecca you're right it

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:12,599
doesn't work we've got 30 million lines

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,880
of code to compile but it doesn't do

00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,630
anything we did this to deliberately

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,119
waste your time and so but of course we

00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:23,460
didn't I mean it does work but but it

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,530
does getting over that learning curve is

00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,540
probably the biggest thing everyone's

00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,760
heard of nagios no one's sort of open

00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,960
and a mess and when the same age so one

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,640
of the things I'm coming here showing

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,320
you some pretty little videos and things

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,230
like that is to hope I get you

00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,740
interested in it to check it out it does

00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:44,040
install if you use a linux server it

00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:46,230
will run on windows I don't know if

00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,589
anyone saw there was an rmi exploit that

00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,930
someone posted I was um last week I was

00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:53,369
in Ireland go to my RSS feed and it's

00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,410
all these news articles about opennms

00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,960
and how it's vulnerable to this rmi

00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,819
exploit well if you poke enough holes

00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,099
through your firewall and allow it to

00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:04,200
get to the open MS box then yes you

00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,390
there's a possibility that this is the

00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,180
next point and we've since hardened it

00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:12,810
even more in open an MS 1604 which was

00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:14,790
released last week but what the example

00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:19,109
they use was they launched they use it

00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:21,510
to launch calc exe and I'm like yes

00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:24,060
someone got opennms working on windows

00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:26,250
I'm like that's amazing it was just for

00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,140
an exploit but mind you the fact that it

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:31,710
was on Windows was a lie ronic to me too

00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,480
but but it's java so i had a bet with my

00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,819
developers I'm like okay it's Java it

00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,950
should run on windows right so it took

00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:39,540
one got two weeks to pour this was five

00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,880
or six years ago it took him two weeks

00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,740
to port open an immense the windows the

00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,349
first thing he had to do was there's a

00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:48,030
little bit of C code because Java

00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:50,940
doesn't really understand the concept of

00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,840
a pain and it's kind of important I

00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,750
don't know about you as

00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,430
first thing I do is I ping things the

00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,960
second part so he spent a week doing

00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,610
that got that to work and he spent the

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,770
next week getting the slashes to go this

00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:06,750
way or this way um because we had just

00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:09,210
hard coded the file separator character

00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,650
so now it looks at the operating system

00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,950
and it sets the file separator character

00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:16,140
to be where it's supposed to be so that

00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,280
was kind of cool one thing I want to

00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,620
stress is you mentioned network

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,510
management um sometimes we get

00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,250
pigeonholed it's like well I need to

00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,410
monitor servers and you're a network

00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,900
management when I say network management

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:29,880
I am treating the network like my 75

00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,620
year old father treats the network which

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,260
is literally anything on the other side

00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,900
of his keyboard you know networks down

00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,930
Liza network down I can't get to my mail

00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,990
can you get to Google yes that works not

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,970
down restart your mail client what right

00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,860
mouse click got in the mat right mouse

00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,600
click on the little mail icon hit quit

00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,600
and click on it again until it stops

00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,880
bouncing okay it's working now but you

00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,400
know so when I I've been doing this I

00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,730
started doing network management 1988 so

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,020
I'm an old guy and that was I mean we

00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,730
had network management server management

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,070
middleware management database

00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,410
management but nms this network man it

00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:10,110
was always the umbrella and so I want to

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,390
stress that we do handle everything all

00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,460
ten layers of the stack you guys know

00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:17,460
the top three right economics politics

00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,650
and God so it's like once you the

00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,750
application layer money drives the next

00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:25,320
decision politics can trump money and

00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:28,350
religion always wins so any more

00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,820
questions I welcome the opportunity to

00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:35,000
bore you even further thank you very

00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,000
