Title: OSMC 2015 | WhatÂ´s Happening with OpenNMS - Tarus Balog
Publication date: 2015-11-27
Playlist: OSMC 2015 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	In 2015, the OpenNMS application was split into two main branches: OpenNMS Horizon and OpenNMS Meridian.
The main reason was to allow for OpenNMS to improve at a more rapid pace. Where it used to take 18-24 months for a new major OpenNMS release, Horizon gets a new major release every 3-4 months.
This model is very similar to the one Red Hat uses, with Horizon being similar to Fedora and Meridian being like Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Also like RHEL, while Meridian is still 100% open source it is only available through a paid subscription.
This talk will discuss the differences between the two version and highlight the new features available in Horizon, such as the Grafana integration, the new Newts.io back end storage model built on Cassandra and the &quot;minion&quot; remote poller that positions OpenNMS to monitor the Internet of Things.
