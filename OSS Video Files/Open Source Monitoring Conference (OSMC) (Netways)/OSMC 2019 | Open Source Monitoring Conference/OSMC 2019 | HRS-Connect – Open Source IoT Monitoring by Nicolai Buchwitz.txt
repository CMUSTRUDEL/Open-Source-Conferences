Title: OSMC 2019 | HRS-Connect â€“ Open Source IoT Monitoring by Nicolai Buchwitz
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The expansion of hydrogen refueling stations in Germany and Europe is progressing rapidly. But how to maintain the overview of all relevant parameters and fault messages? How can the refuelling processes be analysed in realtime in order to improve the systems together with the manufacturers? And how does the data from the system actually get into the monitoring system? This presentation will show how a powerful IoT monitoring solution was developed based on the hardware of the RevPi platform and open source software such as Ansible, Icinga2, InfluxDB and Grafana, which helps to ensure the availability of the hydrogen infrastructure and optimize it further.
