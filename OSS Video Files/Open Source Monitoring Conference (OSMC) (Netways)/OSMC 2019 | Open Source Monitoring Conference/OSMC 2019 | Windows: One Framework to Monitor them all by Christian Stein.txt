Title: OSMC 2019 | Windows: One Framework to Monitor them all by Christian Stein
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Windows environments are nothing new within the monitoring community. There have been many attempts for integrating Microsofts Operating System including their software solutions with plenty of different attempts. Well, now here is another attempt â€“ trying to bring the Best of both Worlds together and allowing an easier integration of Windows systems including the monitoring components. The new Icinga Monitoring will hopefully not only attract system engineers, but also encourage Developers to bring in own custom Plugins and Checks more easily.
