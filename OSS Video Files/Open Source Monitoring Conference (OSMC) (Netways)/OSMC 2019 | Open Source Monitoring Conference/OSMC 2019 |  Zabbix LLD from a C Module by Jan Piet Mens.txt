Title: OSMC 2019 |  Zabbix LLD from a C Module by Jan Piet Mens
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Low-level discovery provides a way to automatically create items, triggers, and graphs for different entities. For instance, Zabbix can automatically start monitoring file systems or network interfaces on your machine, without the need to create items for each file system or network interface manually. Using a real-life practical example which we use to monitor vehicles issued with GPS trackers which communicate via MQTT, we will discuss how we implement Zabbix Low-Level Discovery directly from a C module and how the same C module is used to provide up-to-date information from the vehicles to Zabbix items. This basic principle can easily be adapted to provide similar functionility to Internet of Things (IoT) projects. While it helps if you can read a bit of C language code, we’ll explain what’s going on behind the scenes even if you don’t.
