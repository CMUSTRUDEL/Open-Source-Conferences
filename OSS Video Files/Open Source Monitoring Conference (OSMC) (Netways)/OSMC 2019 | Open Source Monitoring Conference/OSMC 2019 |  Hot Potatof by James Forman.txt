Title: OSMC 2019 |  Hot Potatof by James Forman
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Hot Potato is a message broker that sits in between monitoring systems and messaging providers to ensure consistent relaying of messages to on-call staff. It was designed and developed in New Zealand to survive the harshest worst-case scenarios we could come up with in a country prone to natural disasters.

The goal of the project is to give on-call people control and freedom while giving your notifications every chance of arriving, through any provider or connection you might have.
