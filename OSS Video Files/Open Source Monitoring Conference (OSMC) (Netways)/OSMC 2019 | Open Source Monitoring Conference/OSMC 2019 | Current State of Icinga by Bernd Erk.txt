experience he will be in this smoker

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,820

find him there just want to say that all

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,690
these people are involved in the project

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,519
I'm proud to present that stuff and also

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,019
because I have to say that all the

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,790
people that networks are in some point

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,750
involved in our singer for whatever

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,280
proposed doing some stuff marketing

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,260
printing roll-ups getting stuff in order

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,200
doing accounting so pretty much everyone

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,950
in the company is involved so I would

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,260
just like to do a shout out for

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,590
yeah my role pretty much reduced over

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,230
the last year's a lot I mainly do yeah

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,900
try to make people happy motives most of

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,970
the rest is gone so from the technical

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,250
perspective I really have to hard work

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,030
that I can do my presentation well you

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,069
can reach me

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,909
we are email or you can follow me on

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:54,340
Twitter if you want to using get hash

00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:58,689
okay let's go in to give you a product

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,510
overview just where we see ourselves we

00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:03,459
do let's say monitoring with our core

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,920
strengths with a single core it's about

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,970
availability reliability and all that

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,579
stuff

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,579
automation is a big part in director

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,739
where we try to work with other tools

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,239
and do that very well locks are an

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,980
important stuff where we also work with

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,230
gray log elastic and all this stuff

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,359
around and of course also the metrics

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,220
and analyzing pod so that is the stack

00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,139
creates our understanding what

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,769
monitoring is what our toolset is in our

00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,900
landscape is so often the question comes

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,720
especially busy if you don't know how I

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,310
singer works I try to to visualize it a

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,379
little bit what what I think it does in

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,030
a daily life so imagine that as a

00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:43,930
workflow and because we are in the

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,290
hipsters now I do that with emojis so I

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,109
singer watches your infrastructure right

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,090
and if everything is fine you were happy

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:55,480
because nothing is to do because

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,489
everything is okay perhaps sometimes

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,500
it's not okay but you just you don't

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,819
care okay as well because you don't care

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,799
but then you perhaps a awake at night

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,209
and you get a pager duty or a direct

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,760
notification alerting you're wondering

00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,190
over there is something I have to do you

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:16,900
think about it you do hard work and

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,729
solve it you are happy again but could

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,489
be that you have no idea what's going on

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:23,530
of course you can through hard work

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,229
figure it out with documentation solve

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,669
the problem again you can also figure

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:30,430
out that one of your colleagues messed

00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,229
it up already a couple of weeks ago and

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:36,010
now it's on you to fix that again

00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:38,409
so multiple solutions for here you can

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,740
try again hard work or you can set up

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:44,640
your clown face and you're a happy again

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:49,110
because you do in other ways always

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,570
don't tell anyone and don't tell anyone

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,500
works for you to know it works I don't

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:58,200
want to do this and I have no idea to

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,040
summarize it I singer makes you happy

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,059
that is what we are doing

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,059
[Applause]

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:17,160
highly recommended workflow for your

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:19,500
next work presentation how we achieve

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,270
that we we do a lot of work with all

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,090
these products with learn more with more

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,980
less of course there are things missing

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,570
there are tons of integrations out there

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,300
we don't know we are not doing them we

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,280
are not ripping them this is just a

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,170
bunch of products we are working well

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,800
with where we are know that we work with

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,600
them but that's again our foundation was

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,220
always and will be that we don't

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,660
reinvent the wheel all the time so if

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,570
there's a good solution for a specific

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,110
part like metrics locks or whatever we

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,960
try to work with them going in the

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,760
community a little bit community was

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,390
always a big part and it's always a big

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,710
part I'm not sure because last year when

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,240
I did the presentation we did had it

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,800
because we did it over Christmas or

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
pretty much Michael did it over

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Christmas we have our own discourse

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,610
where a lot of community stuff is going

00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,960
on so if you are looking for perhaps not

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,330
for questions but if you're looking for

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,190
answers that's a good place to put your

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,730
question and a lot of our team members

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,200
are there or a lot of other icinga users

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,910
are there trying to help you with

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,730
various products and stuff we do we also

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,160
have an icing a user survived we started

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,130
on Monday I guess Blair and wrote a blog

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,140
post about it and what we do here we try

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,670
to learn more about what our users are

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,530
doing what they want what part of

00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,420
integrations they're using what features

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,700
they are perhaps missing and what

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,740
products they use we don't know so it

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,780
would be super helpful to do that there

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,430
is a longer explanation on our block so

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,280
block terrorizing outcome we can read

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,310
about it or just note that that link I

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,290
singer combed out survey where we would

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,760
like to ask you what is important for

00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,540
you that we can make our product better

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,210
in the future we have one upcoming

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,640
icinga camp this year it will be the

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,360
twelve of November is I think next week

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,960
Tuesday right yeah I think so so if you

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,800
live in Zurich nearby or you have to get

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,210
some money there go to turi and visit

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,110
our icing our camp you can still

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,020
register there I

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,880
Singam events and for the first time

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,720
next year we're gonna have a big i

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:30,000
singer confident amsterdam

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,200
it's from the 12th to the 14th of May

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,970
the 12s will be workshops and the

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,580
conference will be under 13th and the

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:44,610
14th of May next year in Amsterdam so

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:48,390
we're gonna be there okay we we use the

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,430
evening event to improve that rate just

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,980
make sure you will be there it will be a

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,390
blast of an event so we have a great

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,670
evening event planned already with a

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,370
barbecue outside there are tons of

00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:02,220
reasons to go to Amsterdam I sing as one

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:07,800
of them so definitely make sure you can

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,390
be a part of it ecosystem something

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,730
we're working on all the time is getting

00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,590
new partners on board because I sing

00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:16,430
itself we don't do any direct stuff with

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,900
customers so we have a partner Network

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,180
we have a new partner in India and we

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,800
have a new partner in Brazil they help

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,660
us to grow there

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,250
India was always in a very interesting

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,040
market because we know that we have a

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,830
large community there but we never were

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,660
able to convert the the leads we had

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,140
over there into customers who using our

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,510
product and also Brazil which is a crazy

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,490
huge market because I was at a

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,370
conference last year where somebody just

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,700
put the map of Brazil over Europe which

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,500
is pretty much Europe it's crazy big

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,070
like flying from here to there's like

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,220
seven hours there a lot of people there

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,530
and a lot of movement coming up in the

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,980
open source well they will have about 15

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,360
DevOps days next year in Brazil only

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,680
this there's a lot going on so we are

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,140
really happy that we have somebody there

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,220
and looking forgetting the community

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,110
there perhaps there will be in our

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:18,990
singer camp of course it would build

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:21,590
your in Carnaval of course who is using

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,990
I think I have that slide every year

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,150
where I try to figure out who of you is

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,700
using I singer means of some of which we

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,220
know most of the users we have we don't

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,819
know because it's an open-source product

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,529
people

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:36,689
the packages or do it from github or

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,549
whatever but we don't know we would like

00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,799
to learn about more who is using I

00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:44,039
singer of course having your logo on the

00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:47,129
website please do though and if you do

00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:50,100
it until tomorrow one of you get a free

00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,289
ticket to Amsterdam to the core not to

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,179
Amsterdam but to I think I can't in

00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,069
Amsterdam anything else would you do in

00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,989
Amsterdam is not an hour card it's just

00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:59,970
covering the icinga conf

00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:02,939
so we have a chance under tomorrow 2

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,739
p.m. fill in the your user story would

00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:09,600
be super helpful that we get more

00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:12,929
information about it ok going to the

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,910
product and I try to go through usually

00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:17,279
I'm over time but ok I'm still good in

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,309
time to give you a little bit of an

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,329
update what happened to the to the core

00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:26,999
products in icinga I start with the core

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:31,199
the infrastructure monitoring part so

00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:32,879
currently 211 is our major release it's

00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:37,289
out on the market it took a very long

00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:40,379
time and I think we pretty much spend

00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:42,419
the whole summer on 2.11 because we did

00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,100
a lot of under the hood so we replaced

00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,559
the whole networks taking icinga

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,529
which was privily I would say our own

00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,299
stuff now we use the boost libraries to

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,609
do so also we replace the TLS

00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:55,379
implementation and all that HTTP

00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:57,409
handling making icing are much more

00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,579
reliable and also in larger environments

00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:01,829
it's capable of handling more

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:03,959
connections and all that stuff so for

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,089
those of you who are having and have to

00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,489
deal with a large environment I singer

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,809
2.11 is a big improvement even perhaps

00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:11,819
you cannot see it in the web interface

00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:15,419
or something like that but it's really a

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:18,600
big stuff going on under the hood here

00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,279
also the performance riders like

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,799
elasticsearch graph are in flux to be

00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,559
they are now able capable to run in a

00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,779
che environment so they are highly

00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,669
availability if you need that in a

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:33,929
cluster environment you can configure

00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:35,549
them now in an HR motors also another

00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:38,369
thing to mention is to read all handling

00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:39,720
because before I sing we hit a single

00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:42,659
process then we reloaded the

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,669
configuration that that process was gone

00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:46,319
and now we do it in a different way that

00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,830
we fog another process out which means

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,510
it's

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,820
one of the foundations required to run

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,220
icing in a container because if you kill

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,720
your main process in a container it's

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,210
not so much fun because then your

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,430
containers gone so we do that

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:08,459
differently that's also something happen

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:16,440
into that 11 thank you so it's the first

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:19,290
kubernetes user no yeah for those who

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,570
needed means and also container support

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,050
because I think containers are here to

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,480
stay

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,700
not that Daka is here to stay but I

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,649
think containers are here to stay

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,330
this is one of the parts we need to be

00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,970
part of and we would like to be part of

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:36,600
having icinga readies for the container

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,060
infrastructure our web interface 2.7 is

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,920
the current release what happened there

00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,110
we have support for markdown and all

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,580
that common stuff which is like current

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,140
for the current web release nothing to

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,480
do with upcoming other stuff I'm telling

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,040
you later we have support for Japanese

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,029
and Ukrainian language some of you is

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,560
able to speak Ukranian or Japanese ok

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,709
there perhaps that point was not a

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
perfect match for here but anyway just

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,100
that you know we have a huge community

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,500
they contributing it because nobody of

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,910
us is able to do Japanese translation so

00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,529
we have people there using it

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,660
contributing back and this is how

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,640
open-source should work that they found

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,920
the language in all ways language is an

00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,690
important barrier to get user acceptance

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,250
which is always underestimated because

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,200
we come from the tech perspective thing

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,570
everybody should be capable to do it in

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,730
English but this is not the case if

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,040
people can find their GUI in the local

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,890
languages also helpful to get acceptance

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,660
also jQuery which is also important for

00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,390
other stuff in our web in the framework

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,370
all the forms in list views especially

00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,100
in the old configuration part got a

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,390
redesign and also a lot of improvements

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,270
for the model developers which are

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,910
important for us that this easier for

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,270
them to extend our singer another thing

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:53,610
is like integrated colorblind theme

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:57,600
there are so many people who are in some

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,850
way not able to see all that colors with

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
this crucial for monitoring as well that

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,259
we have a color

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,209
theme you can switch on if that some

00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,360
somebody in your in your company and I

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:11,790
learned because Foy was in our extreme

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,250
gave a talk in Stockholm how many people

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,440
are really involved by that and and how

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,180
a blind seem could help so also like

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,639
screen reader features said how we can

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,889
read out the text-to-speech stuff

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,880
improved a lot if that's something for

00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:30,180
you you should definitely have a look

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,370
vSphere Thomas I started to crying

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:47,550
already it's the first slide about your

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:49,079
stuff yeah okay you see like Thomas is

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:53,279
pushing all the time and playing our

00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:57,259
product manager is highly in danger and

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,389
crying a lot to get this done who's

00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:03,209
never heard of it

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:08,220
honestly who never heard of it and using

00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:12,449
VMware for hands you should definitely

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,480
use it what it is the eye singer for we

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:17,100
sphere is a module where you connect to

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,040
your vSphere infrastructure and get all

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,660
the detailed information about your

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,389
voice for infrastructure you host

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,339
performance be motions all that stuff

00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:30,300
resources we have our own API

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,089
implementation so we're not using the

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,639
VMB implementation because life is too

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,529
short for that because it's very slow

00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,269
so Thomas developed his own stuff I

00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,360
guess he changed it five minutes ago but

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:45,300
it still works so there was a lot going

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,430
on and that this area one of this it

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,050
provides now an import source in the

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,860
director out-of-the-box there is no more

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,689
escrow knowledge required anyway

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,660
everybody not he should have some basic

00:15:54,689 --> 00:16:02,220
SQL knowledge is the database person I

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,959
tell you should have perhaps not it's

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,389
now able to run without icing a director

00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,860
which was previously a requirement that

00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:09,809
you have both on it so now it's also

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,899
possible to run the vSphere model

00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:13,829
without the director and more of a lot

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,149
of

00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:21,310
improvements in the UI one thing is that

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,139
it's now much more clearer if you see if

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,199
a VM is in a power off stage which was

00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:27,490
previously harder to figure out and also

00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,579
the detail view is much more powerful

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,819
where you can add all that resources he

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:35,860
and can customize your visual grid can

00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,180
you read it like reset power status host

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,069
memory and all that stuff

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,810
so you can figure if you and have a

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:43,180
detailed view on your vSphere

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,130
infrastructure there are also

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,449
screenshots in the github where you can

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,449
see them in detail that's a little bit

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:51,300
too small for the presentation right now

00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:56,160
but a lot have happened there

00:16:51,300 --> 00:17:01,149
director which you released like now

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,620
well director 1.7 now the new minor

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:07,600
releases 1.7.2 if I'm correct is our

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,589
configuration tool who is using icinga

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:17,470
director who is using icing are not

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:19,630
using icinga director there are tones

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,010
there are tons of reasons to use it

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,059
perhaps there's of course a reason not

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,669
using it there are other ways to

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,439
configure eyes singer but director is

00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,120
our way to configure eye singer because

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,190
we think it's a crazy powerful tool

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,260
sometimes we think it's too powerful

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,020
because it's hard for us to figure out

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,510
what is able to do because it can do a

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,270
lot we also have Japanese translation of

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,070
course and this is of course in Japanese

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,530
if you want to learn it

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,809
we have schedule down times now

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,600
configurable with director coming with

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:51,220
1.7 and now which is really cool for

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,950
large environments are where multiple

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,080
people working with director we have a

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:59,020
preview of all changes before you do it

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,669
so if you like now to a deploy you get

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,710
all the changes on the object base you

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,750
can do the conflict if but now you can

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,280
see what object changes especially if

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,830
one object changed multiple times

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,120
because other users perhaps worked on a

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,700
service template or something like that

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,419
they can now do it with director and get

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:21,010
a preview with it that's the Japanese

00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:23,190
translation of director it's it's cool I

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,190
think

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,779
that's the schedule downturns feature

00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,970
and here's it's just an example if you

00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,890
say we have like who is like a Microsoft

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,860
pitch day or pitch night or something

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,659
like that some of you that's a pretty

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,000
easy example how you can do that I would

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,559
say you would like to do just the

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,600
schedule downtime for my Windows stuff

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,520
this is one part of the screenshot the

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,350
next one is coming soon where you get

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,779
your fixed downtime it's it's no in this

00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,640
case just a 20 minute duration and then

00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:54,440
you kids use the director host variables

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,870
and say to everyone in test environment

00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,789
using Windows you have your downtime

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,919
which then creates a rule for that and

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,899
then you have automatically configured a

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,120
downtime for your Windows setup every

00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:10,909
Friday every Thursday or whatever now

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,950
double with director and another thing

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,539
is the sync preview where you now can

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,399
see what happened to your configuration

00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,110
you get a summarized where you see what

00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:20,570
address in this case or display name

00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,820
imports which changed you get a diff and

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,880
before you ship the code to I singer you

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,260
can see pretty much anything has changed

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,120
which is I think for a large environment

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:37,659
a pretty cool feature all right

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,659
I think a BP modeling who's using this

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:47,149
crying okay I will try in two minutes as

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,399
well I singer BP modeling was previously

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:50,870
I singer business process monitoring and

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:53,360
it somebody was business processing for

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,090
something else now this is the name for

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,279
it there are a couple of new features

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,630
and one of us that you now can use drag

00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,419
and drop in the overview and tree layout

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:05,510
who of you is using the PPI Donna knows

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,740
that this feature exists not so many

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:12,110
which is cool because then I have

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:14,419
something to show you can import and you

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,149
can import and reuse define business

00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,370
process in the UI you can also export

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,320
the data but export is way harder to

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:25,279
reach like import it's like the cloud

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,020
easy to import hard Trek sport right we

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,549
can do both but you can import your

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,950
stuff very easy and I will show you how

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:36,070
that works and also the breadcrumb UI

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,840
makes it easier to go through bigger

00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:45,280
business processes I'll show you how the

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:49,760
looks like hopefully don't it up

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:54,650
that's true okay

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,600
so this resolution so now we have like

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,000
just here it's just a small example

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,560
business process what you previously

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,510
need to go to the configuration would

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,420
like to change some order you can do

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,830
editing now and just move them from one

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,780
left to another if you have multiple

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,200
objects or a dashboard it's super

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,220
helpful

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:19,580
we just import another one that you can

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:22,090
see it so I have a predefined process

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,090
here

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:31,460
then you can see we have like queue

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,400
benitez work flow or whatever that is

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,550
business process here in that case to

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,220
store it you go go into the objects and

00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,690
also right here perhaps it makes no

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,700
super sense because it's just like a

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,140
database machines but now what you

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,240
previously had to do going back to the

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,000
file you can just go here drag the

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:53,360
objects where you want them to be store

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,760
that in the web interface and then

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,640
you're ready to go so for people who

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
using a lot of this is super helpful

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,220
also export is possible I was

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,410
complaining yesterday or two days ago

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,650
that we cannot do the export but of

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,180
course we can we just have to go here

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,170
but now I have to find it again that

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:17,570
would be tricky where was it it's here

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,930
no now we're just running what's going

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:24,640
on

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:24,640
alright so the windows are closing huh

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,930
what is that last monster

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:51,280
okay III try now and now I found it yes

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,620
thanks God and now you can export it

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,030
here as well so you can download it or

00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:04,750
make a dip with the previous

00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:07,920
configuration who's using a MEK who is

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,030
using Alfred or who's knowing Alfred

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,190
Alfred is a pretty cool tool as a

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,440
replacement for a spotlight where you

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,220
can make fancy things like I don't know

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,530
I show you you can go icinga and say i

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,030
would like to go for cube and then open

00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,250
up icinga directly from your shell

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,620
without looking to the interface it's

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,970
pretty easy so if you're using Mac I

00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,530
highly recommend using our Fred I'm not

00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,780
getting any promotion codes for here but

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,970
I show you how it looks like you go to

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:42,070
web search get your custom web search

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:44,980
here and then you can enter your search

00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,540
well your search query and the keyword

00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,820
to start and then you can go directly

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,740
from your Mac and going into the icinga

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:55,030
web and looking for groups hosts and

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:57,400
services and all that stuff I don't sell

00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:02,290
licenses afterwards but that's a cool

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,800
feature going there all right going back

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,800
to the slides

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,530
new features I singer for windows who's

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,990
been in the talk from Christian in the

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,640
morning which is I'm sorry I planned

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,290
didn't plan the rooms accordingly though

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,990
we'd have to stand was my fault because

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:30,860
last year was already full and we should

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:33,650
bring him to another room Christian

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,050
which is usually in sales I tried to

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,410
repeat it he's a salesperson who did all

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:42,340
that stuff in PowerShell as the future

00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:45,590
windows monitoring for icinga and

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,390
because the room was so small it was my

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,000
fault now it's on you because you have

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,830
to look the video again Christian

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,990
prepared to show what the main windows

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,990
monitoring can look like in the future

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,900
it's a shame

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,210
[Music]

00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:33,700
[Music]

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:59,080
[Music]

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:06,079
[Applause]

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,079
[Music]

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:30,620
[Applause]

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm super proud and feel ashamed in the

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:40,040
same way he did an excellent job if you

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:43,340
really would like go go deeper so we

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,230
record we recorded his speech the slides

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,140
are on there you can ask him of course I

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,670
will not go any other windows theater

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,180
because first of all I have no clue how

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,090
it works

00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,860
I know what PowerShell is but that's it

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,140
so Christian knows it better if you want

00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,500
learn about windows monitoring you have

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,240
not been to Christian so please check

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,120
the archive later

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,140
so usually like two weeks after the

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,470
conference you find all the talks there

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,360
I sing your AWS what it is it's not it's

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,050
not in general on you because we had an

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,370
AWS import source indirectly previously

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,770
but we now have a known model for it

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,150
will be perhaps perhaps as the wrong

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:28,940
word will pretty much have more features

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:29,420
in the future what it is i singer right

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,230
now

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,880
is a singer for AWS is right now

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,290
important they have director in place so

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,290
what it does it has support for multiple

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:42,860
regions in AWS and also object types I

00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:44,660
come through it later on there are

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,310
direct modifiers where you can handle

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,500
incoming data from your AWS

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:51,380
infrastructure in and keep in sync with

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,060
your outer scaling groups and there's

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,040
also the synchronization mechanism which

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,900
IBM which I mentioned already that you

00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,420
get your data from AWS in place with

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,160
your monitoring infrastructure so one

00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:05,030
thing is that you have multiple AWS

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,450
resources where you can connect to

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:11,870
whatever AWS region your object type

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,720
right now we have easy two instances but

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:18,590
also load balancers and multiple AWS

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,210
types are supported there's also the way

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,830
that you can have property modifiers

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,420
where you can blacklist or whitelist

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,310
specific objects because there are

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,390
things in your outer scaling group you

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,390
are not would like to have in your

00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:31,370
monitoring that makes it super easy to

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,470
get this done like every 5 15 minutes

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,090
whatever and also with the synchronous

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,299
Asian part and I see now that the

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:41,590
screenshot is not helpful at all but

00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:44,330
what you see is like a screenshot from

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,799
lots of data coming from the left to the

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,740
right and at the end we sing it and put

00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,990
it to director which is helpful if you

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,059
use AWS together with director again

00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,860
you're out a scaling group in it you

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,970
should definitely have a look on that

00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:02,150
module I singer for Tyra who is Chara

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,549
not who is who is using Chara Oh a lot a

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:08,570
lot ok

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,220
who knows that module exists not a lot

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,520
ok that's cool

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,840
I singer for Chara what it is it's up

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,860
there hassle free deep integration with

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,340
Atlassian Chara

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,169
so it's an I singer module which is able

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,970
to get all the data out from Chara and

00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,130
show it in place through monitoring

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,020
configuration you can see it here you

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:30,289
see your tickets I have a better screen

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,700
show later on so what it does you get a

00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,890
detailed issue list with all the

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,309
approach it in issue information in our

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,289
singer including the avatars of Chara

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:41,870
there's direct command coming with the

00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:44,020
director where you can create tickets on

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,970
the fly as pretty much as a notification

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:51,260
using it and you can also trigger custom

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:53,120
workflows with the Chara the overview is

00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,159
not much better now but you can see that

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,289
we are getting the avatars and icons we

00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,980
get the issues and projects out of of

00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,980
Chara

00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,289
there's the Chara host notification and

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:08,990
another screenshot who makes it more

00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:11,809
clear for example is that way that you

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,480
can create specific JIRA issues out of

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:17,659
icinga where the chera project an issue

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,090
type is queried from icinga we get this

00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:22,010
information out of Chara and you can

00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,169
select which Chara project an issue type

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,450
we would like to use and there's also a

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,490
way to write a specific description and

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,549
use it in a template which means you can

00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,429
all fill the specific Chara issue

00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:36,740
tickets using the template you can

00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,120
develop on the icinga side and pre fill

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,250
it with the relevant data out of their

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,789
icing a notification giving performance

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:45,409
data responsible person or whatever so

00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:47,780
we have an integration in both ways you

00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:50,240
see the issues you can create them out

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:57,520
from my singer which is really helpful

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,520
if you use it all right it's in gonna be

00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:09,580
alright what it is this is the exact

00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,580
same same slide like last year anyway

00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:19,010
what I think it abhi is I think a DB is

00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:22,490
a replacement not only for Ione I do but

00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:24,860
for I I do so we had for many years

00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,830
because in the core the database model

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:30,620
is pretty much the same for all the

00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,850
years we have especially in larger

00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,730
environments we have sometimes

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,750
performance issues the schema again does

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,150
not provide any helpful information

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,880
regarding SLI reporting so we can do

00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,370
that on the old database schema but for

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,470
example all the SLA data is in one table

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,450
I sing a state history where there is a

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,910
procedure you can go all through it but

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,720
it's not it's not built for that and

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,050
also for the flexibility for future

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,840
stuff in icing how that that works like

00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:03,260
kind of known it's not kind of it's how

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,790
it works right now what we're doing with

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,410
icing and explained that last year that

00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,030
most of the information we have to

00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,030
update in the database again and again

00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,890
is nothing else perhaps then again okay

00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,480
again okay in a large environment we

00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,670
update like every five minutes we say

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,830
disk ok disk ok disk ok we write the to

00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,240
the database all the time but in the

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,520
next five minutes we throw the data away

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,250
and update new ones and that's

00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,740
performance why it's not so smart so

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,900
what we do now I sing our writes all the

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,600
data with the Redis writer feature which

00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,700
will come up with a 2.12 icinga

00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,070
we have a Redis rider feature we write

00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,750
all the data into Redis and then we

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,220
figure out if it's like a structural

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,810
information we need to build up the web

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,480
interface and figure out relations

00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:47,180
between objects and like basic names we

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,060
write that in turn our body our DBMS my

00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,280
sequel Postgres and all the volatile

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,490
information just stays in to Redis like

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,050
the last ok state changes for example we

00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,670
have to write in the database because we

00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,950
need to stain changes afterwards to have

00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,830
an SLA reporting but not the

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,210
current last plugin output for example

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,260
if we just tagged an updated okay we

00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,690
don't need to write them here

00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,669
and so I sing our web what it does it

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,139
reads the data from the database to

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:13,760
create the structural view perhaps

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,440
permissions and all that stuff

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,780
grabbing the data out of the database

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:23,270
and the rest of it like plug in output

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:27,109
and stuff is coming from Redis why did

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:29,500
it take so long it's a good question I

00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:32,060
answer that for you because now

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,829
everybody has like a TV channel right we

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,560
have like Disney TV and Apple TV and

00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:41,149
Amazon Prime in our and of course we

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:44,359
have that crap too so here's an

00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:47,899
explanation why it took a while to bring

00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:51,379
our singly B to reality in a llamar

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:58,190
cocinero Vegeta okay may Paula paella

00:34:51,379 --> 00:35:00,020
Venga Venga aqui meter bang yo Tony pain

00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:06,670
now poking the video component on a

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:06,670
Maalox Chandler get mine yellow booyah

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:18,600
[Laughter]

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,840
[Applause]

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,340
[Applause]

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:35,380
no civilian the regular

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,770
[Music]

00:36:46,600 --> 00:37:02,180
[Applause]

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:06,660
this is what I do at the weekend

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:10,650
all right this year we have a demo and

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:16,550
it will be hopefully great it will it's

00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:20,850
no video it's no video all right um

00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:24,650
the resolution is not so good I try to

00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,650
make it better perhaps I regret it but

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,760
should I try it

00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,760
how come on we have time

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:53,280
okay right now it's written I sing a DB

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,930
because I singer to be itself from the

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,870
web perspective will be a replacement

00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,760
for your current monitoring module at

00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:02,130
some point we also need perhaps like a

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,790
dual mode and also there's stuff to do

00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:08,520
still where we get your old status data

00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,380
history in the new database model so it

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,100
will be an additional module in the

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,500
first place

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:19,140
current line on my demo is like a single

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:22,170
it be so first of all it looks now it

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,760
looks on the screen it's crazy big if

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,320
you're familiar with the old icinga web

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,420
you see that we don't have any icons

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,360
anymore so all that information if

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,820
something is okay or is it in a downtime

00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,380
or is it acknowledged like here we all

00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,420
have the individual component on the

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,860
left hand side so all the icons are gone

00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:43,590
we had distributed over the layout let's

00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:49,550
see if we can find a critical host map

00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:52,410
server amsterdam coincidence so

00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,630
something for a chamber we changed that

00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,640
things like a downtime is now going to a

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,380
model we don't have the right bar

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,480
anymore if you can remember previously

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,550
like the whole column switched in all

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,920
that stuff like comments and all the

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,660
things are going to be in a model so I'm

00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,930
creating a downtime I don't know evening

00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,930
event

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,170
so it's directly in there you can see

00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,060
the downtime here and I show another

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,160
view later on where you can see also the

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,310
downtime how it how it progressed over

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,600
time we have a visual check statistics

00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,340
down here where you can see what

00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,710
happened to the last check how many

00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,020
check attempts we have the check soars

00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,730
execution time when the next shift will

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,430
occur that you can see it on a timeline

00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:41,290
and that visual element will be there in

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:42,970
multiple other views of icing and the

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:46,000
future as well where you can have a

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,710
graphical overview about your check

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,060
statistic for that host check or the

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,619
service check and you can see that this

00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,960
is moving because the next check is

00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,820
appearing coming closer and also for

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,390
down times and I come to that later on

00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:00,520
you see it also if you would like to

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,400
leave the downtime again you just cancel

00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,140
it and now it removes previously you had

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,600
to do all that that they have to close

00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:11,200
it again so it's very intuitive to work

00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:15,600
with us with with a web interface I go

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,600
into another server which is the cube

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:24,609
also the history part changed a lot what

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,170
we have here that you know in every

00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:28,270
element where you can see a state change

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,369
you can see the current state and you

00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,530
can also see the state it cut is coming

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,810
from so we can see what it was if before

00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,190
was it a warning was it critical so

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,570
every time you can see what happened

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,390
there is it like a hard stains or a

00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,400
state change but also you can see every

00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,530
time how many check attempts we have

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,030
which is this symbol is you can see like

00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,970
two or three checker tents happen on

00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:51,130
this whole subject so everything is the

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,300
individual and the left hand side that

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,800
you can see you don't want you what

00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,060
happened so what the state is what

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,220
stated was coming from

00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,040
how many check attempts were in there it

00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,960
makes it much easier for you to figure

00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,830
out the correct data even if the state

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:09,040
history you can go through it like you

00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:15,850
know it from my singer going to the

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:17,710
services we have the whole state is much

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,510
more cleaner to identify in the service

00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:22,150
you where driver clean every service can

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:24,040
see if the host is ok or not so we

00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,530
always in every service see the relation

00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:30,270
to the host which is pinned on and see

00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,270
if the host has a problem or not

00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,300
also the plug-in output is a collapsible

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:37,520
module now wear heels longer the plug-in

00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,140
output itself is not helpful and this is

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,880
coming also to the custom variables

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,510
where you can open it up and close it

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,130
again and get more stuff into the detail

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,920
output and see what's important for you

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:50,570
also the notifications which users are

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,370
involved in the notification part which

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,500
user group which user gets a

00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,530
notification out of a singer in case

00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:01,600
something happens so let's look for a

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:16,040
stay type for example I use that filter

00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:17,030
stay type M it my fault my fault it

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,340
up

00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:22,160
also here when I look at services which

00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,890
are in the soft state every time I see

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,630
how many check attends are this is super

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,130
useful if use it because it gives you a

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:33,110
quick overview on all the services you

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:35,390
see what's going on there their comments

00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,890
as well so we move the icons away and

00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,930
you can see you're in the tech life it's

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,170
acknowledged if it's perhaps now it's a

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:46,580
little bit small if it expires at some

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:49,190
point and also the down times if you go

00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:52,010
on them so every downtime now is a

00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,690
process bar where you can see how far in

00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,760
the downtime you are and when it's the

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,070
downtime to be expire which gives you an

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,720
visual impression where you are in the

00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,910
downtime if you have multiple down times

00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,100
if you have a down time for current work

00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:05,540
on the machine it's helpful we see how

00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,080
much time do I have without like

00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:11,060
calculating the time and watch watch the

00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,330
minutes go by you can see the progress

00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:18,260
bar you also have that in the host

00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,850
itself so if we go to what was it my

00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,850
Seco I write it down here

00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:25,490
I had a downtime created like I don't

00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:28,340
know now hour ago where you can see how

00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,940
far you and the downtime does it make

00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,650
sense hopefully so that's super helpful

00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,830
especially if you have multiple of them

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,650
you can see how far you have gone in the

00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:43,010
downtime the host groups you looks

00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,390
different so in the host groups view it

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,690
gives you a way more detailed overview

00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,250
about how many house or services then

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,850
the objects have a problem or not you

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:56,090
you get these please what is the name

00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:59,390
for the charts donut donut donut charts

00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,680
and also the service is then there so it

00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,320
gives you a better overview if you're

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,320
large environment to go into it and of

00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,390
course you can go from the services you

00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,700
can go to that group like you know it

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,830
and still keep the group overview on top

00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,480
which is super helpful if you work in a

00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:19,150
specific host group you keep their old

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,150
information up and and have it there

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,540
another and it's pretty much any

00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,550
questions so far you're so quiet which

00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:33,890
makes me nervous all the time waiting

00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:38,750
for an error no no Eric occurring it's

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:48,310
pretty cool we have a few switcher now

00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:48,310
so this element yeah sorry yeah

00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,470
yeah I try to repeat the question for

00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,059
the camera so the question is that we

00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,349
have authentification in the previous

00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:08,619
monitoring module if you would like to

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,599
keep them in the new database model yes

00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:13,180
but it will be changed at some point

00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,640
because especially in large environments

00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,049
authentification could be a problem if

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,819
you have imagined like five hundred

00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,260
thousand services and say like this host

00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:23,559
group is only allowed to see this and

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,240
that so it will be a rework required and

00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:29,260
an update required for all is single web

00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:31,240
modules to cover that new privileges but

00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,880
the basic foundation will be will remain

00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,619
and will be the same so we not take any

00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,440
of the features away regarding user

00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:41,440
groups and assign stuff which which

00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,690
objects you are able to see so it will

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,859
be perhaps it will change but not in a

00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,910
way that you're missing a feature

00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:50,650
sorry correct answer hopefully you you

00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:59,829
your eyes don't look like my answer made

00:45:50,650 --> 00:46:01,930
sense in any way but that will be the

00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:03,579
same so the same privileges in what

00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,470
actions you allow to do all that stuff

00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:07,690
which I singer is currently capable of

00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:10,299
will be available in the future as well

00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:12,549
nothing to do with it means that data

00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,869
how I singer here gets the data out is

00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:16,029
totally different which is of course

00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:18,609
something you cannot see so imagine that

00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:21,279
information here going back to the host

00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,809
list what host we have like the oast

00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:25,480
host object and all this stuff that

00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:27,640
comes out from the database but these

00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,319
for example comes out of the Redis so I

00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,750
singer just reads the data differently

00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:33,579
but but the identification and

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,200
authorization mechanisms on top of it

00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:36,940
are independent from the monitoring

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,950
module itself so you can have the same

00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,430
filter rules privileges and all that

00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:42,630
stuff

00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:46,019
with the news you guys singly be as well

00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:48,160
okay going back to the few switcher

00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:49,539
especially in large environments people

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,079
sometimes would like to recommend it

00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:55,140
would like to see more and this is what

00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:57,309
the abuse switcher is for which is

00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,650
available in the host and the service

00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:02,289
view we just get more information and

00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,940
you can see how fast it is you can have

00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:05,230
like at just in the demo have a couple

00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,000
of hundreds but also if you're a couple

00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:09,460
of thousands in it you can just go

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,589
through it you can go back to fixed size

00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,359
or you can also have

00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:15,130
the fullest plug-in output any of you

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,869
however you would like to have it so if

00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,729
you would like to have a lot of details

00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:21,279
on the first end you can go there it

00:47:18,729 --> 00:47:22,989
also stores that stuff perhaps also in

00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:25,119
the user preferences in the future that

00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:26,289
you can configure icinga web the way you

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,869
would like to work with it

00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:30,579
because we figured out that that people

00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,710
have a different opinion some people

00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:34,299
would just like have a super blank list

00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,279
and a lot of objects and one view others

00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:38,109
would like to have very detailed and so

00:47:36,279 --> 00:47:41,170
in the future you as a user can decide

00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,789
and it's super easy to work with that

00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,309
stuff and also for example here where a

00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:47,469
service check is over to you it's pretty

00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:49,630
easy to identify that object in the long

00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:53,289
lasting list over hundred of objects and

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:59,829
you can see what's going on any

00:47:53,289 --> 00:48:03,309
questions because that's it for I think

00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:06,150
a DB right now they did what I think

00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:06,150
that it be looks like currently

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,780
is it available of course there are

00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,240
currently two repositories it's like I

00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,310
sing a DB I think I think a DB and I

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,760
think I sing I web to module I sing a

00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:31,520
tepee

00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:34,130
this is you guess it it's like the go

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,620
demon who is that I sing a DB part so

00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:39,860
that if you remember the purple square

00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,810
in my other slide is written and go and

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:47,410
this is what I sing Gary B is and the

00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:49,520
moduli singer abhi is the web module so

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:52,310
currently we don't have the packages

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,890
available if you're familiar with go you

00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:58,120
can do a go built-in a go run if you're

00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:02,090
not familiar with go you can go away and

00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:07,640
wait for the packages later on they are

00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:10,820
coming soon to summarize this what you

00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:15,110
have hopefully learned I singer director

00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:17,800
is out since half an hour the vSphere

00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:22,900
stuff is out for two hours I guess and

00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:25,430
the charm audio is out for one day I

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,770
sing a to the 12 and to the 12 is a

00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:29,660
requirement for I sing a DB because with

00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,640
I sing a tool at 12 comes the reddest

00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,080
feature which writes all the data to the

00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,340
Redis which is currently not and a

00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:40,130
singer too at 11 the source is there the

00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,650
the source is there but the packages

00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,410
will be as a release candidate will be

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:47,180
there November I guess in two or three

00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,990
weeks which pretty much makes sense

00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,850
because then November is over and the

00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:55,940
same for di single eb release candidate

00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:57,500
so the web module is an as an in the

00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,920
future replacement for the monitoring

00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:02,450
module will be available in November I

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,550
think definitely there's some

00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,680
documentation to do we will explain you

00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,630
how it works I think in the first hand

00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,190
side it totally makes sense to have

00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:14,000
perhaps both modules running at the same

00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:15,680
time we also know that we have to come

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,270
up with a migration script that you get

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,890
all your old icinga state history

00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:20,810
information to the new database model

00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,240
and can make and reports out of it

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,940
there's also a reai singer reporting

00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,980
module coming up it's also there there's

00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,780
also a templating there but it's not

00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,380
release ready and there's the

00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,970
and why I didn't show it today but to

00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,860
get all the data out it's required that

00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:38,990
we do some stuff and especially make it

00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,510
easy for you to replace the current

00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:46,820
monitoring module with the icinga DB

00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:50,180
monitoring module don't forget icinga

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,980
conf again we definitely would like to

00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:56,930
see you there we will be there with a

00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:58,400
couple of people I guess and if you have

00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,670
any questions now it's the right time

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:10,810
thank you so far for listening

00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:16,880
[Applause]

00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:18,680
any questions do you like it because

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,360
they worked the ass of the last week's

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,760
to get it done

00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,800
especially our weapon uux team and the

00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,360
core they are sitting on the back that

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,760
they have a chance to run away if we run

00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,930
in any error but it works for us thank

00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:41,530
you folks

00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:41,530
[Applause]

00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:49,070
yeah any questions

00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:51,340
means we have time evening event starts

00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,340
in an hour

00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:05,950
anything are you happy

00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:15,920
ah yeah anyone oh thanks God Robert I

00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:17,810
will not give up testing okay okay I

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,200
will repeat my question from the last

00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:28,580
two events you promised to do a native

00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:31,480
mobile app for a single now we have to

00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:39,050
hurry up for the evening event sorry

00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:41,630
yeah well good question not for now yeah

00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,970
yeah the question is not you that's true

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,380
so regarding the mobile because we have

00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,860
that question already like an hour ago

00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,600
outside we started with doing a mobile

00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,090
app I think it best based on react I

00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,800
guess we did some prototyping and we

00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,930
already had some views a notification

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,060
done honestly it's a matter of resources

00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,220
so one thing is we would like to make I

00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,440
think I work way more better and mobile

00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:06,890
friendly and also bringing native

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,500
notifications to your mobile device say

00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:12,850
Android in iOS using Web Apps which is

00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:16,100
now possible that you can do there

00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:18,170
honestly having a great fancy icinga app

00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,030
would be or would be awesome but we need

00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,900
like two or three people working on that

00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:23,810
all the time and we don't

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:26,120
of the resources for it but I also think

00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:29,540
that we can bring I sing a web to a

00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,430
level where the mobile experience should

00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:35,180
and will be so good that you hopefully

00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:42,170
don't miss the app so much which is then

00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:43,970
making a long story short no there was

00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:51,580
another question I think two rows behind

00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:55,280
you blind hi hi Shakira IndyCars jaan

00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:58,190
30 will they work in both directions so

00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,070
if I acknowledge India will it be sown

00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:08,920
back to a singer I think knowledge as

00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:11,540
well yes and it's configurable thanks I

00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,070
I just knew the first part of the answer

00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,960
that it that it will work that it's

00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,430
configurable Chalmers knows better so if

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,100
you're working with Chara and interested

00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:21,740
Thomas's Stephanie the right person to

00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,540
talk to or now is the microphone and now

00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:26,360
we need all time because he will tell

00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,430
you how the chart integration works it's

00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,110
just the mother is there to first of all

00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:32,480
have notifications in an automated way

00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:34,340
so you define templates to trigger your

00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,990
workflows you can say for some servers

00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,060
you want to trigger workflows that

00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:40,490
address your customer so you ship let's

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,440
say the customer number from the server

00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,110
from the custom bar to gyro to special

00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:48,140
special fields for other servers like if

00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,610
you need to ask for new resources if a

00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,740
server has not enough memory then you

00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,450
want to have a kind of different

00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,480
workflow where you want to trigger the

00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:57,950
issues on demand and you can choose

00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,560
create an issue in a drop-down choose

00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,940
your workflow you defines and then your

00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,560
jar will be filled with everything you

00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:09,490
need and then so always if you create an

00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:13,370
issue that relates to a problem in icing

00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:14,780
its stores that information to Jireh so

00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,360
do you need two fields in Jireh for

00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,790
deaths it updates the state in gyro and

00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,490
state changes and if there is a new read

00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:24,230
notification for whatever reason it

00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,030
first looks if they are already eaten

00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,560
isn't this issue if there is an issue it

00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:31,010
makes an update otherwise it makes a new

00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,720
one and yeah and you can then say if I

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,210
created an issue then everything is fine

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,190
I want to auto acknowledge this

00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,810
apart and then it's the problem is

00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:39,910
acknowledging that's its or you can say

00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:41,230
no I do not want to acknowledge and then

00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:43,780
the problem is seen it keeps open

00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:47,589
sounds wonderful thank you you're

00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:49,210
welcome any other questions maybe as I

00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:52,060
have to make just one little correction

00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:54,160
the new feature is seeing 1.7 with the

00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,470
sync preview is not for changes that

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,380
human beings this and this is this has

00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:02,290
been built to preview import and sync

00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,839
operations so if you trigger a sink that

00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:06,760
will trigger also thousands of changes

00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:08,680
to your objects it gives you a very

00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,680
brief good summary and shows exactly

00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,500
what properties changes how off which

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,880
objects and so on so just but what you

00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:21,670
described the right existed since quite

00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:23,109
some time right sorry hey in the current

00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:26,500
web interface we have the limitation

00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:30,460
that we for example cannot use links as

00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:33,040
a host force I mean in the new weapon

00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:36,609
Theresa does just sing a DB thing will

00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,950
there be possibilities that we can add

00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:42,270
meteor data to a host and use them as a

00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:44,950
link for example so we can for example

00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:46,300
link to a confluence page to this host

00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:54,580
or something can you give me the catch

00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:58,030
folks please that's already possible

00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:00,520
because you have these navigation items

00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:06,490
and I sing a web to and you can figure

00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:08,740
that with any host reserves variable so

00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,869
you construct an URL and use a customer

00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:14,680
or a service name or a host name and

00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:17,589
then you share it to users user groups

00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:22,740
or roles so it's already possible to

00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:22,740
create links in detail areas

00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:39,859
right yeah

00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:49,099
any other questions Oh Brahm that was

00:57:39,859 --> 00:57:52,760
shared responsibility using the web that

00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:57,230
isn't forcing me to run an end-of-life

00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:00,290
PHP package I don't know

00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:10,280
but perhaps Eric knows or Thomas knows

00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:14,089
or still know nothing okay so we'll keep

00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,500
three packaging now sort of thing this

00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:19,310
is how an interactive discussion should

00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:22,480
work means yes I don't know whatever

00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:22,480
sounds good

00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:30,349
let's summarize it fantastic okay I

00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:33,020
don't want to see your time again I

00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:34,190
would like to thank everyone who is like

00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,740
involved in that stuff

00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,930
I hope I didn't it up it took a

00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,700
long time also like internally we were

00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:42,109
discussing this a lot like when will it

00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,790
be ready when will it be ready and

00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:45,890
customers were demanding and asking for

00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:47,859
it and this is really cool so look

00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:50,000
forward to it by the end of November and

00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:53,119
try it out give it a try give us

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,770
feedback always we highly encourage you

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,800
to give us free pictures because that is

00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:59,630
what makes icinga better so thanks for

00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,349
everyone thanks to you for listening and

00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:05,060
