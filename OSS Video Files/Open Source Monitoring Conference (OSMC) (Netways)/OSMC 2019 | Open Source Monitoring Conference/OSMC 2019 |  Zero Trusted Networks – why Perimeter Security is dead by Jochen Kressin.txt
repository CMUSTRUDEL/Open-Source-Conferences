Title: OSMC 2019 |  Zero Trusted Networks â€“ why Perimeter Security is dead by Jochen Kressin
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	In the days of microservices, cloud, Saas and Paas, perimeter security, albeit still widely used, is not sufficient anymore. Inside attacks have become more prominent than outside attacks, posing a huge risk to your network and data. The Zero Trusted Networks approach treats all hosts and components as if they were internet-facing and considers the entire network to be compromised and hostile.
