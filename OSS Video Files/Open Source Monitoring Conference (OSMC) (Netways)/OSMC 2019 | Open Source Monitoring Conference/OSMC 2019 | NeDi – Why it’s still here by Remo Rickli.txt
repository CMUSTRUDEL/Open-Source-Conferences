Title: OSMC 2019 | NeDi – Why it’s still here by Remo Rickli
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	NeDi is an open source software tool which discovers, maps and inventories your network devices and tracks connected end-nodes. It contains a lot of features in a user-friendly GUI for managing enterprise networks. When the project started around 18 years ago, there was not much else around. With many successful open source projects appearing in the meantime, it’s a different story today. So why is NeDi still alive and kicking?

hi everyone thank you yes indeed nadia

00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,540
is old it's 18 years old for any

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,820
software that's this old is probably

00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:31,730
really considered to be old I started my

00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,620
own business five years ago so I guess

00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,830
after five years you can say well it's

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,650
good to still be here and let me show

00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:42,230
you why that is but first let me show

00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:53,720
you what I do when I'm not working on

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:57,710
Nettie so why is this so yes I took both

00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:00,260
of those pictures and that's what I

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,350
actually like doing I my hobby is

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:09,350
photography not what those guys are

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:13,040
doing but it looks cool right and so I

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,960
do do stuff as well not just taking

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,049
pictures or I should say I do take

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,500
pictures on that's actually me and that

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,930
too

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,700
so as we can tell I'm living near

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,370
mountains and there is two ways to get

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,930
up there by foot or on wheels and well

00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,299
heading towards 50 I bought a motorbike

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:40,310
so I guess that's how it goes right yeah

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,950
so this is stuff that keeps me equalized

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,520
and just programming old time is a bit

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,380
boring and also after taking pictures

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,020
you can play with them doing like a

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:56,210
three-eyed lizard or a goat cut and

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,700
maybe some more fancy stuff and this is

00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,670
not photoshopped its skimped so it's

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,909
open source but yeah it's fun to do that

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,479
it's creativity right and there is one

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:11,550
area in photography I also try to sort

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,990
of get

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,290
better ah and that's macrophotography

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,210
this is a different topic and when you

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,280
look at those pictures some of you might

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,030
think well I'm actually happy I don't

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,210
see more details others might think well

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,980
if he takes pictures like that I don't

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,360
want to know how he's programming right

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,760
so why is he still here

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,970
well macro photography is is really

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,680
cumbersome because auto focus forget

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,290
about it it never works

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,600
so what you do is you do take a lot of

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,550
pictures and eventually some of them

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,590
turn out just right

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,710
another problem is light when you're

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,530
this close you need a lot of light to

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:59,480
get the picture right and so if you keep

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,990
really pushing it and yeah don't give up

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,540
they might turn out like that

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,250
so a bit better right so and this is a

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,130
good analogy which brings me to the

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,540
programming part you can throw in some

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,910
code it works and obviously as I've seen

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,740
in a previous presentation it works in

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,380
the development environment but it

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,630
probably doesn't end in production so

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,540
that's the same process right you need

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,910
to iterate over what you've done and

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,760
then try to improve it and you never can

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,090
really predict how it turns out until

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,200
you test it for real right so that's

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,700
kind of yeah where I want to get at with

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,520
the first reason why I'm still here so I

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,830
never gave up I really try to keep

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,430
improving stuff and I mean I'm still not

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,440
where I wanted to be but I guess can

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,700
take another 18 years till I'm there and

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,100
then I'm retired that's fine so 18 years

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,160
ago what did the world look like 18

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,070
years ago well kind of like that

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,860
the tools were more mechanical I mean if

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,650
you look at old computers they almost

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,110
looked mechanical like even in the 80s

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,510
90s you could tell what chips you're

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,459
looking at these days everything is so

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,640
compact it's a completely different

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,250
world and it's similar with the tools so

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,110
back then there were some

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,590
to work monitoring network discovery

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,800
tools but they looked good at first

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,380
sight but when you try to figure out how

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,090
it works

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,620
might be problematic if you think about

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:43,200
it so I decided to start my own tool

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,910
with my own ideas which I collected over

00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,880
the time I was working as a networking

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,280
guy and that's what I came up with its

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,790
Nadine Eddy of obviously stands for

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,169
network discovery and that's exactly

00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:00,810
what it does it crawls the network

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,820
predominantly using SNMP I know very old

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,680
as well but for some reason it's still

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,710
around despite all the other

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,680
alternatives especially in the network

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,830
environment SNMP is still the standard

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,180
so to speak I mean there will be new

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:20,640
additions with REST API s and an SSH

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,370
console access and stuff but SNMP is

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,169
still there

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,690
so what Nady does it discovers the

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,720
network it goes from switch to switch

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,110
and router and whatnot and tries to

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,910
discover the whole topology it discovers

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,600
all the computers that are on the

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,630
network and assigns them to the switch

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,720
ports it finds out IP addresses through

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,450
ARP tables and so forth and while it

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,600
started as a generic tool actually back

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,370
then I was we have only had Cisco

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,560
devices so obviously it started as a

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,630
Cisco tool but now it's really vendor

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,479
agnostic it doesn't care what what you

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:04,260
have you can define your own MIPS to

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,229
support your devices so the depth I can

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,900
achieve now is really going down to a

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,900
level where you could detect fan tray

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,919
problems for example and in the new

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,140
version of Neddie

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,720
you can acknowledge this problem even

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,610
add a comment that somebody ordered a

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,060
new fan tray and it will be replaced and

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,760
when you acknowledge such an alert the

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,850
alert status turns blue meaning somebody

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,750
looked at it we're good and so forth so

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,780
that's like the level that it makes it

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,840
possible to use an ad as a

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,210
network management tool these days it

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,750
hasn't always been like that another

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,110
issue here with the topology Maps so

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,240
this map is based on bridge tables or

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,400
MAC address tables only there is no

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,890
discovery protocols providing

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,540
information for those devices as they're

00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:02,450
not supporting it and remember the macro

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,540
photography thing so the map here that's

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,980
like part of what I meant before the map

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
is still not where I want it to be

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,360
because it can be really cumbersome to

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,060
create useful maps with Neddie I know

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,590
that I'm aware of that but yeah I'm

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,680
still in the progress or in the process

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:23,780
of improving that but if you get it

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,870
right and they're quite useful so a new

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,320
feature of the upcoming 9200 next year

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,940
will be that I even go further and use

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,740
all this information I have from the

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:39,110
discovery to create a trace layer to

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,410
trace view where you have an end node

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,760
Remis that's actually this notebook

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,560
connected to this switch which is

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,300
connected to this switch which is

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,900
connected to the firewall and then you

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,280
get to see the whole path your packets

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,530
are taking with all the interface

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,419
statistics so that's where I want to go

00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,760
to and I think this is going to be a

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,740
great addition to any other monitoring

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,700
tool because now you can really track

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,540
where you could or wherever problems

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,900
might occur on an interface also natey

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:17,960
is 18 years old so back then there were

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:24,229
no JavaScript frameworks no responsive

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:26,630
CSS things and there was no Ajax but I

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:29,419
start to adopt with newer things and

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:34,010
here you can see the HX lookup of device

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:36,260
names so that's also I'm catching up

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,210
probably not as quick as I should but

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:43,060
yeah it's it's we're getting there so

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:46,760
yeah and in addition to the computer

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,820
discovery things we do have additional

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,620
feature that lets us do security audits

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,960
so we can use nadie not only for

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,590
networking people but also for security

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,480
people people that would go to a new

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,510
network and try to figure out what's

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,480
even on this name I mean in larger

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,490
networks network admins do have this

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,640
problem the network grows sort of in a

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,840
more or less biological way after a few

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,640
years you don't know what's on your

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,120
network anymore and there is a few other

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,520
factors helping and then there is IOT

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,090
and all that so that it's not gonna get

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,290
easier so security is a big aspect here

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:29,030
of the Neddie focus another one is well

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,120
it's more like a side product but you

00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,970
can discover printers and toner levels

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,280
and all that and of course you want to

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,290
back up your configurations because if a

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,020
switch goes up in flames you want to

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,560
restore it quickly and keep get it up

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,040
and running as fast as possible

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,540
another issue or another big or growing

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,920
part of Neddie is inventory and

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,540
lifecycle management and so forth

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,450
so with nadie you can discover the

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,470
network get all your assets in and then

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:07,550
either create your inventory and

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:11,320
calculate your costs by the way- o will

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:15,200
have a new feature for depreciation

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,830
calculation so you can you see where you

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,510
have the most value in your network and

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:23,060
last but not least you have reporting

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,550
which allows you to create fancy views

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:32,720
of all that what nadie is collecting

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:34,790
right and of course still in here those

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,860
who know Neddie know that because it's

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,520
that device list and now as you can see

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,980
you have all kind of devices discovered

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,290
here and the colors here indicate how

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,540
long it's been on the network so this

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,760
one has been found a while ago and

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,820
hasn't been seen since so this is

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,200
turning red if it's turning blue it

00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,750
means it's been on the network for a

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,850
while and if it's green here it means

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,710
it's been discovered recently more

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,750
recently I should say I mean the picture

00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,709
is a bit older it's from yeah

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,139
17 okay so but you see where I'm getting

00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:12,170
at so you have one glance and you see

00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:16,310
what what you got on your network and

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:19,290
Nettie discovers ESX servers routers

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:26,879
windows machines if you have an add-on

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:29,490
and yeah Linux machines even phones IP

00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,649
phones and and this all plays together

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,569
because you can attach your PC to the

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,610
phone and then the fountain Network and

00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,129
then if you're troubleshooting you

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,490
should be aware of where is what

00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:44,009
connected to be able to mitigate

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,050
problems right so yeah that's pretty

00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:49,500
much what Maddie does that's the

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:52,889
discovery part but I said discovery and

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:56,850
management here so it can also monitor

00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:58,949
the things you discover or and that we

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,629
will look at that later on tell other

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:06,720
tools what to do with what an ID I

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:09,000
discovered of course to be a bit hip it

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,860
has a black theme now which is important

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,100
these days everything has to have a

00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,639
black theme right this is a dashboard

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:22,079
which you can build with Neddie now on

00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:24,809
top we see event timelines like it's a

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,269
filter on events where Nettie detected

00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:29,819
the reboot and on large networks this

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:32,309
can be very handy if you want to ensure

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,949
stability because if you ping something

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,870
you don't necessarily detect how often

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,720
it would reboot because it can reboot

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,209
maybe mr. ping maybe not and then it's

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,519
back up which means in the meantime you

00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,740
lost packets but you never detect it

00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,899
with monitoring so Neddy can detect

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,930
reboots and now you see graphically when

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:54,540
Windows reboots are happening or here

00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:56,279
another event graph with latency events

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,050
so when you have high latencies in some

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,870
areas of your network you can detect

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,240
that as well and again some reporting

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,610
stuff built in into the dashboard which

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,189
again you can configure yourself and as

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,500
I said I don't really have the latest

00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:12,899
and greatest features so the reporting

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,269
stuff is not drag and drop which you

00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,810
might expect these days but it works and

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:21,710
it's it works stable so that's a

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:25,880
it's the compromise discovering the

00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:29,690
network so as I gave a few examples what

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,700
that means here is a few more so for

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,790
example when you have a switch with

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:39,370
modules line cards and you know SFPs the

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:43,250
fiber-optic plugins and power supplies

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:45,200
you can go to search with not with every

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:47,330
device obviously but with most of them

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,430
or with a lot of them go down to a level

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,370
where you can check the status of those

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,190
modules and here for example the power

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,250
supplies if if one power supplies power

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,860
supply doesn't have power you will learn

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,410
about that the moment the second power

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,210
supply loses power as well but that's

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,040
not the idea right if you have redundant

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,100
power you want to make sure both are up

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,410
and usually monitoring would not detect

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,670
it until it's too late

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:19,160
unless you monitor the actual power

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:21,260
supplies another issue fabric extender

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,200
if you don't know what that is so

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,780
network devices come in very different

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,570
flavors one of which is that you have

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,180
dump switches that are actually managed

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,310
by your Smart Switch the brain so to

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,390
speak and those dump switches that

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,190
cannot be pulled

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:39,680
they don't have an IP address they to

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,110
only talk to that smart guy but this

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,120
smart guy is only one IP address so

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,370
imagine you have a data center with one

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,890
smart switch or two and a lot of dumb

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,810
switches in your racks so how do you

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,610
know if you have enough ports in every

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:57,980
rack because you cannot directly access

00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:00,589
this dumb guy meda can treat those dumb

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,180
switches as modules just like here and

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:07,280
then we can look up the ports assigned

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,700
to those modules and get the port status

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:14,959
so in this rack or for this dump switch

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,720
we have 11 ports up 25 inactive in 2012

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,420
desirable ports so this also helps you

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,850
managing your data center

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,089
speaking of data centers so yeah

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,350
networking still based on SNMP but that

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,600
doesn't mean that networking doesn't

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,710
change I mean all of you probably heard

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,300
of Sdn

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,790
and for some this means NSX in VMware

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,880
but also there has been other solutions

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,730
with open flow for example and many

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,700
other technologies that are pushing into

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,800
the networking VLAN I guess was the

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,800
start of it now we have V excellent

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,529
which is transparent layer 2 networks

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,870
over layer 3 networks and that's where

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,790
things get complicated even especially

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,480
when you want to monitor that so I'm

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,520
trying to also catch those V excellent

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,060
additions to at least show you what you

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,670
have configured and a lot of times

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,830
configuration mistakes or errors are the

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,600
cause of problems you have later on in

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:20,899
your network another commonly used

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,690
feature is link aggregation or depending

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:26,750
on the network hardware used trunks or

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,209
poor channels Nady is able to detect

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,180
port channels and is and find which port

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,490
is assigned to which trunk port or port

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,260
channel for a lot of switches not all of

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,800
them yet but again I'm working on that

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,660
as well and I mentioned the Maps so

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,339
while they're cumbersome at times they

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,380
can also be very useful because you can

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,690
dynamically create maps and show a graph

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:52,610
on top of it with that you could

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:54,620
document some network parts which is

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,950
also actually a good reason to use

00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:01,630
Neddie it helps you document and find

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:04,400
your way around in your network so

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,860
another big topic these days green

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,250
technology right so I figured yeah my

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:14,000
green I mean do I do what I can so Nady

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:17,420
is still 4 megabyte in size that's of

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,740
course if you have a package from your

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,750
distribution you can simply upgrade with

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,069
update or whatever but with an 84

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,569
megabyte is not a big deal either

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,630
because you can upload the power ball

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,179
with the GUI the web GUI and then apply

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,730
database changes and you're done so it's

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,790
very simple to keep Neddie going with

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,950
new releases and also it's designed not

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,870
to be a resource hungry so if you have

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,970
Nady you can run it next to your other

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,659
tools and it will go through the network

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,390
can scan it rather quietly and does not

00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:55,130
put any load or additional load on your

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:57,590
networking components I use a solo

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,010
keyboard to develop it for what it's

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,030
worth

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:05,360
yeah I know not much I live near a water

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,919
power plant and we do buy water power so

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,840
I guess that makes it green right and if

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:15,110
you don't believe me I have a picture to

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:19,880
support that yeah good so why is Neddy

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:22,490
still here looking at all those big

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,460
tools and well back when I started I

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:29,630
think Nagios was there and yeah not much

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,580
else so where does Neddy fit in here the

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,850
marketing guy in me would say well sure

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,820
on top but I guess we all know that's

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,919
not true so the technician in me or the

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,780
consultant would say well if you look at

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
the building blocks of your monitoring

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,450
environment maybe might as well be the

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,789
crowd in between those blocks

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,480
nettie can help you connect those blocks

00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,340
and an intro let them interact net

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,100
itself as an API but you can easily

00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,950
fetch data out of the database and then

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,409
leverage it in other tools and that's

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,530
actually what quite some partners of

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,510
Nady consulting or me are doing they use

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:12,490
an ad as a discovery engine and then

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:15,799
feed their monitoring parts or even

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:19,220
gather Network environment Network

00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:22,190
assets and put it in I do it for the

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,110
CMDB part so there's a lot of ways you

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,419
can use Neddie and combine it with other

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,480
tools and I guess that's part of the

00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,380
reason why I'm still here I'm not

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,080
competing with all those other tools

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,809
directly but I add features that can be

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,940
useful so I said Nettie has is a

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,789
networking tool but it also has a lot of

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:48,020
use in security and what that is I can

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:51,049
show you now Nettie's open source yeah

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,149
so I have a forum where I do support the

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,420
community and if I have time I look into

00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:58,940
the forum yeah that's

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,840
what I do to keep native life as well

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,870
but one day the forum was down I could

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:10,330
not access it anymore so I called my

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:13,850
provider and the provider said those

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,260
yeah feared words right yeah that's what

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,250
you don't want to hear him and you hear

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:21,260
them that's what you look like so what

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:26,510
happened well I looked at the statistics

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,280
and I saw this PHP script on my web site

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,260
I don't even know what it is I don't

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,710
know who got it there in the first place

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:36,620
apparently WordPress had a vulnerability

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,530
at the time and you could upload PHP

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,590
scripts and this PHP script was used to

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,420
send email so it was a spam relay and

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,460
that's why the provider took down the

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,220
website yeah it's one of those things

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,050
you don't really want to see but yeah it

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,760
happened now I learned from that and I

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,950
also wrote a script where I could

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,410
analyze my log files and figure out what

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,200
was going on but these days Nady can

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,720
help you in such cases as well let me

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,840
show you so you all know those mails

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,850
right the phishing emails these days and

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,980
in a company when you get a phishing

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:18,560
attack most people probably don't click

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,150
the button but those who don't look at

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,750
the headers which give away that

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:26,150
something is a bit fishy literally and

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:30,560
when you look at the link behind this

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:32,800
button 24 kentuckians and they I'm sure

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,260
they don't know they re providing this

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,610
service or whatever it is so they might

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,680
look the same as I did back then but so

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:47,000
what happens when you get that one of

00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:49,840
those in a company you probably want to

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,680
know who clicked the damn button right

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,330
because then you can talk to those

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,190
people and ask them it whether they

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,220
transmitted the password or force them

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,360
to change any passwords anyway because

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,270
I'm not sure if they would admit that

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,820
they actually sent the password anyhow

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,190
the solution to this would be traffic

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,780
analysis while Nady does not do that

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,180
itself

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,150
use an F dump the noise you guys know

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:19,820
that tool also written by a Swiss guy by

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:24,430
the way to analyze the traffic and but

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:27,890
also what I do is you can have

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:30,560
visualizations of the traffic so you see

00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,980
who is talking to whom and the bandwidth

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,490
according to that communication so if

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,590
you had such an attack you can easily

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,020
track who was talking to this website

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,160
and then go to every single user and

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:49,820
track down whether you had a leak or not

00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:52,520
in a different way to use this view

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:55,940
would be to have your source address and

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:58,900
the destination port so now you can

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,370
check whether your computer's are

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:05,000
communicating in a meaningful way or

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:09,170
perhaps if you had a lot of traffic on

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,990
port 53 DNS you might be looking at a

00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,140
DNS tunneling case and you can find out

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:18,400
what's going on like that as well so

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,650
this is a very powerful addition to Nady

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,490
in addition to this addition that didn't

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,800
sound right but anyway um I do who is

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,590
lookups so if you have external IP

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,770
addresses try to use who is get the

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,740
favicon so you know who your clients are

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:39,740
talking to so when you see a few clients

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,170
or one client talking to I don't know

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,450
North Korea a lot maybe that's not what

00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,670
you want to see but you should be able

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,990
to identify that at least and then you

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:54,110
can take actions also an ID is aware

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:58,310
your internal IP addresses whether they

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,930
are a computer well here we see a phone

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,020
but it's a computer as well it's an end

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,090
node or if it's a device or something

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,400
else so Nady has all the layer 2

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,300
information and can combine the traffic

00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,730
information with it which is more than

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,740
some other tools can do but it I'm not

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,200
saying it's it's like you know D tool

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,090
but it can help you to look at it from a

00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,299
different way or a different perspective

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:27,809
now you can also add policies to your

00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,029
traffic patterns and then figure out if

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:33,419
that's the traffic you think is normal

00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:36,629
but if it's not you get alerts that will

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:40,440
notify if traffic patterns are deviating

00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:42,450
from your views or from your settings

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,610
here and then you can also graph that

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,519
and then check out whether you have any

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,440
security related incidents or something

00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,999
is not right in your network and you can

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,899
look back in time how often that

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:57,059
happened now this is nice and all but

00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:59,309
for monitor your like the monitoring

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,929
guys right so from monitoring I also

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:07,529
have an a an alternative way to use this

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:11,759
NetFlow feature because how it usually

00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:14,249
works I'm going to explain it quickly we

00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,879
have a switch that can be configured to

00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:20,249
export net flow or s flow data to a

00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:23,009
collector this might as well be the

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:25,289
native machine but can be a different

00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:28,110
machine and maybe only accesses the data

00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:30,799
and displays it in the user interface so

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,999
that's what usually net flow

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:38,039
installations are doing but

00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:40,590
alternatively you could simply sniff

00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,309
traffic on a mirror port on the device

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:48,629
and then have here the collector

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:50,629
actually captured traffic directly the

00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:53,789
disadvantage is it's going to be

00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:56,220
complicated these days which it would

00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,019
still work on 10 gigabit interfaces but

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,139
these days we have 40 gig hundred gig

00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:03,570
it's not that simple anymore so you need

00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:05,940
to be wary of how you want to implement

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,710
that but if you can implement it the

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,320
collector will actually capture traffic

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:14,789
from the switch directly and with that

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,279
it allows to measure latencies like

00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:19,740
application latencies latency to the

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:23,009
client and latency to the server just

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,740
from the traffic streams and this can be

00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:27,539
an extreme benefit if of course somebody

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,070
calls the help desk and says the network

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:33,570
is bad again which always is right but

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,290
then now you can identify is it really

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,350
the network

00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:42,360
or do we have a problem somewhere else

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:45,390
how this works it uses the three-way

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,990
handshake every TCP connection is using

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:52,200
so we have the same packet that is sent

00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,120
from the client to the server in the

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,380
middle somewhere we have our monitor

00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:01,320
port now in the same packet is passing

00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:05,280
through the monitoring port and the

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,680
server receives it it sends back a sonic

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,310
we can measure the time between the

00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,440
Cenac and get the server latency and on

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,360
the other hand when the SUNYAC is sent

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,300
back to the client we wait for the ACK

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,550
packet and then we have the client

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,830
latency and later on during the

00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,730
conversation we get the application

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,450
latency from the continuous

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,330
communication from the server back to

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:36,320
the client so this is a real improvement

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,320
as to isolating problems on applications

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:44,070
of course maybe I don't know if you know

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,910
that but Neddie the current version is

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:50,460
1.9 last year's version was 1.8 next

00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:54,090
year's version will be 2 oh because it's

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,010
20 the year 20 so I'll keep it simple

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,650
but trust me there will be a lot of new

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:02,760
additions in - oh it's not just the tool

00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:04,230
by itself and maybe a new theme but it's

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,470
going to be a lot of things in there one

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,480
of which is that you can have several

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,550
NetFlow sources now sending data to

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,500
Nettie and you don't have to do much

00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:15,210
about it you just keep the traffic

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,700
coming in and that it will sort it out

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,770
for you this allows you to draw graphs

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,930
like this so you can see we have a lot

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,210
of traffic from this source but not much

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,010
from the second one so that's a new

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,820
addition that makes stuff much easier

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,440
with the traffic tool here also a new

00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:35,460
addition and again we're back to the

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,110
Maps this is a d3.js by the way so it's

00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,450
all dynamic in your browser and you can

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,220
drag it around and look at the traffic

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,350
now I use d3.js maps for the topology

00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,120
but I managed to apply to a network

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,390
traffic as well so you see

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,850
send and receive computers or network

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,659
devices or external websites and you see

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:59,789
who is talking where to and whatever so

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:02,850
this is also a great way to visualize

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:09,029
the data to get more insight what's

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:09,960
going on now Nady discovers MAC

00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:13,860
addresses right

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,809
and it also discovers ARP tables so so

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,730
far it's been difficult if you didn't

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:23,789
have the MAC address and you would

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:28,260
wanted to see a subnet and the nodes or

00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:30,330
the computers living in this subnet you

00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,149
could not really do that in medi with -

00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,340
oh it's possible to see an ARP table

00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:39,600
like that so you can actually display

00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:41,669
all the ARP entries and if you have a

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,460
layer 2 entry you will actually see

00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,110
what's behind that our entry I hope you

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,779
know what I'm what I mean because it's a

00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,580
bit technical I guess but here this guy

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,679
does not have a layer 2 entry but we

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,659
still get the ARP entry to look at so

00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,169
that was not possible before but now it

00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,299
is and you also see some services that

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,570
are running on those computers so there

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:05,549
is two ways to get to or and what

00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,580
operating system there is so there is

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:11,070
two ways to get at least to know what

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,610
operating system we have so the first

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:16,890
approach is to scan subnets with Nady it

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:20,399
does a little port scan just like four

00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:22,440
or five ports nothing near nmap and it

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,710
will get the answers and then from the

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,570
answer I can derive whether SSH is

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,340
running with which version this is also

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:32,070
good for security to find all the rest

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,779
sage versions in your network also all

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,240
here obviously we have an engine X web

00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,789
server and from those responses I can

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,169
see that it's a debian system running

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:45,690
those but here we have android and this

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,690
is there is no information here so

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:52,860
what's also possible that you can use

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:57,240
the HTTP fingerprinting and derive from

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:59,780
the DHCP requests what client is behind

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,030
this IP address in the end

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,400
and this has been written by a friend of

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,470
mine and you can download it add it to

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,330
Nadia's open source as well and then

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,210
point it to the native database and this

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:16,730
script will update the computers in

00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:22,400
Neddie accordingly passively also new

00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:24,470
features in 8200 will be F ping or scan

00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,050
subnet scans with F ping which is much

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:29,930
faster but also much louder obviously

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,730
and I said an ad is quiet well not so

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,220
quiet if you don't want it to be but

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,710
yeah it's your choice but you can scan

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,650
networks now and display the results

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:43,160
like that so native was a bit hard to

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:45,200
use for let's say non networking guys

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,850
because you didn't know where to start

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,840
right so and I'm trying to change that

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:53,060
now with new features new scan

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,880
possibilities to really get the

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:58,880
information out of your network another

00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,670
security related feature I'd say is that

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,210
you can monitor stuff on your switches

00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,740
and of course if somebody changes the

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,060
configuration and you ask them did you

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,480
change something and the answer is

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,970
always no but now you can prove that it

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,400
might not be the case after all so here

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,500
is an example we create a command like

00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,160
show access lists it's a standard

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,000
command on a switch - obviously list

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,970
access lists are filter rules for

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,070
denying connections and this is a whole

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,370
bunch of options here for the net e call

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:38,060
so here we see this s option means skip

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:41,000
and this whole string means means skip

00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:44,000
everything so don't read anything more

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,150
or less with SNMP go to this address and

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,920
execute this command this command ACL if

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:51,200
you prepend it with div

00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,320
it will execute it and the next time

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,970
it's executed it will check against the

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,360
previous version and if there is a

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,920
difference it will send an email so this

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,510
is what the file looks like and if there

00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,630
is any change you will get notified

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:07,340
immediately so it can also help

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:10,120
mitigating problems of things nobody

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,110
changed right

00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,220
speaking of configurations

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:15,320
Neddy can backup

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,450
figurations and while doing so you can

00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,760
check against things you want to have in

00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,480
your configuration or don't want to have

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,990
in your configuration and a new feature

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,870
is conflict contexts so a context is for

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,520
example an interface so you have to hold

00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,760
the global configuration and then you

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,309
have per interface configurations and if

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,070
obviously an ad discovers the network

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,350
and knows about the topology it can

00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,990
leverage this information to prove or to

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,960
check against the context so in this

00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:51,080
case we have the interface five so we

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,990
can check in interface context for four

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,659
in the context for this interface if a

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,030
phone is connected to it I want to have

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:02,179
the voice VLAN on that port otherwise

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:05,360
the phone will not work right so you can

00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:08,300
create rules and if this is this in a

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,280
scenario has been discovered but the

00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,859
configuration is missing that voice VLAN

00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,879
part able to throw an alert that you

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:18,530
have a problem there it won't work and

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,899
what those rules look like that's those

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,099
are the events that are spit out from

00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,929
that and those are the rules

00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:26,240
so here we have switch port mode trunk

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,909
it's yellow meaning if it's missing on

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,399
this switch type when a phone is

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,940
connected to it create this alert and

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,369
that's the other similarly for global

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,960
conflicts you can probably you don't

00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,830
want to use community public anymore

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,619
maybe so if it's found community public

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,480
which is green create an alert that we

00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,240
found this community entry in the config

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,359
so this is a new way to make sure that

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,280
the conflicts of your infrastructure are

00:34:52,359 --> 00:35:00,650
adhering to your policies now that was

00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,080
all a bit security related towards the

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,839
end we were more in the networking part

00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,220
so let's look at networking anyway right

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,960
well that's where Neddy is at home so

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,750
and this is not just for network now

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,369
this is in general how you could

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,300
leverage nary even if you're not a

00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:20,300
networker

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,880
so how it all started like 2001 right

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,520
you have a network you have a network

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,000
team usually one guy who knows how to

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,300
patch and install the new hub or switch

00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,120
and and the services back then were like

00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,850
you have computers on the network

00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:41,110
connecting to a file server some first

00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:44,900
web browsing I guess but not much more

00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:49,370
the network grows so does the network

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,470
team the network team grows more but

00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:59,300
maybe the guy is unusable and goes away

00:35:51,470 --> 00:36:00,890
but the network still grows so now new

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,790
services are being added to the network

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,890
like VoIP and we all know what what

00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:11,530
happens when VoIP is not working anymore

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:14,630
nobody is working anymore and of course

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,580
building management will be added to the

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:19,010
network as well so no pressure there

00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,500
right so we're getting more and more

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:24,050
stuff put on a network and if you're

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:27,170
really lucky your company merges with

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:30,500
another company so the network maybe

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:35,140
doubles or at least grows a lot more and

00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,140
if you're really lucky the new network

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,790
will have the same ip address as yours

00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,110
so that's where where things get hairy

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,050
because you need to sort it out now

00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:49,280
somehow and the new guy might be usable

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:51,070
but yeah who knows what's for sure we

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,900
get more and more services video

00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:56,090
conferencing and maybe the manufacturing

00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,680
part will be on your network as well so

00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,450
go figure what happens when that's not

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,390
working anymore then you're in really

00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:05,210
big trouble right so where does not I

00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,310
help you with all those changes in your

00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,860
network it sometimes might be very

00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:13,400
useful to have a snapshot of your

00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,860
network at this time and then you start

00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,950
changing your network around adding the

00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,900
new features the new services new

00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,670
switches then it might be helpful to go

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,430
back in time and check what did the

00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:27,980
network look like before we started

00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,770
changing it around right so with maybe

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,150
you can create snapshots and then go

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,400
back

00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:37,110
time and see what the network looked

00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:40,510
like before that's possible

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,190
also for networking in general and now

00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,920
we're really at monitoring and I said

00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:47,290
Ned II can do monitoring you can create

00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,780
your own dashboards in Ned II that's

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:53,350
actually a customer network and I got

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:56,070
permission to show that he created those

00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,110
dashboards himself so you can really

00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,090
yeah benefit from from the maps again

00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:04,930
and as you can see they're not so bad

00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:07,750
again if you yeah if you try an error

00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:10,740
then I guess it's usable there is an

00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:14,620
editor again no drag-and-drop it's still

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:17,340
more HTML but I think it's a usable

00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,690
approach nonetheless you can create your

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,990
dashboards the order how you want to

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:27,850
display your stuff and again it comes in

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,920
black so we're good also the reports in

00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:34,870
Ned II can be added to the dashboard now

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,730
so here we see the overall the network

00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:40,750
status and underneath we have a lot of

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,850
the top used interfaces broadcasts these

00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,920
cards very important these cards means

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,870
you're losing packets and you want to

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,910
know which ports are losing packets in

00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,670
case the customer rings up again and

00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,290
claims there is a network problem then

00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,540
you can tell them oh yeah I guess we do

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,040
have a network problem or not and then

00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,620
of course errors on the interface as

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,080
well so this is possible now with the

00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,690
dashboards in native another more recent

00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,150
feature is optical monitoring I

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:11,800
mentioned those SF piece right so you

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:13,750
want to have some sort of overview

00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,140
whether the signal levels of your

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,640
optical transceivers are within range or

00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,940
not because if they're not you might

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,430
lose packets you have slow connections

00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,890
and stuff like that so nadie is able to

00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,200
do that for a number of switches now

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:32,530
again a work in progress I will improve

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:38,620
that and yeah hopefully get most of them

00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:40,990
in our or support it important as well

00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,780
other tools do that as well of course I

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,460
had to focus that I want to find out

00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,220
what

00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,650
AFP is using on or is used for which

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:52,830
interface because if the interface is

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,660
down like here you don't care about the

00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:57,270
optical status because there is no

00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,550
signal the link is down so you don't

00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:03,210
want to get alerts on that but if if an

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:04,800
interface is up and has a bad signal

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,080
then you want to get alerted on it like

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,990
here so the interface is up it's green

00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,940
but the signal level is too low so you

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,240
might want to look at that and check out

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,760
what's wrong with the cabling also

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,560
interesting here we have a SFP which is

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,380
down so maybe you want to find all those

00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:26,190
SFPs that are plugged in but not used I

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,070
mean they cost quite a lot of money

00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,500
depending on the type so that's an

00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,410
interesting aspect of discovery or a

00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,750
monitoring with nettie also with Nettie

00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:39,480
since it collects all those ARP and IP

00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,430
information and MAC addresses you can

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,530
verify your IP address management with

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,930
Nettie so here we have a view of a

00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,180
subnet showing you all the computers in

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:52,170
the subnet and you can check whether

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,810
this matches up with your iPad in

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,290
addition as you remember networks keep

00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:00,690
growing right they're not ever shrinking

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:04,080
so you need to add new subnets Nettie

00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:08,400
has an IP address calculator which lets

00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,099
you compare what you display here to the

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,820
database so you can find unused subnets

00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,130
which then you can configure later on

00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,740
and of course that should be done in

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,470
ipam but sometimes stuff gets lost or

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:26,310
missing you can check whether this

00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:28,170
subnet is really available or not also a

00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,690
new feature or a more recent feature

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:37,040
this year actually is a layer 3 net

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:39,000
layer 3 Maps so if Neddie finds device

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,770
connecting to another device with a

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,109
point-to-point link it will draw that

00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,450
point-to-point link which it's not here

00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:48,900
now but I'm just saying and if it finds

00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,430
that there is more than 2 devices in the

00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,619
same subnet it will add a cloud

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,420
automatically which is to submit and

00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:56,640
then connect all devices to that cloud

00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,470
so we have a layer 3 topology

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,570
representation

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:03,910
here another example of how you can use

00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:06,640
layer maps to document your network

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,430
there is a simplified I can set so you

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,140
could document the DMC for example very

00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:14,650
easily and then put it in your word

00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:17,110
document and make the boss happy I look

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,820
at Visio export I haven't gotten around

00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,100
it yet but maybe that's something that

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,940
should be added as well we'll see I hope

00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:28,120
I can get around that also the maps this

00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,860
is a example of a recent feature showing

00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,870
the spanning tree of a map I know

00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,610
everybody hates spanning tree I know

00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,980
it's old but sometimes you still

00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:39,400
encounter that so you can check the

00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:41,290
status of your network again here we see

00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,120
that those trunk ports or link

00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:45,280
aggregation ports I mentioned earlier

00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,740
that can also be shown in the map now

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,750
and here you would see this red link

00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,100
that's the one that's blocking otherwise

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,530
we would have a loop here in the

00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,320
spanning tree so again that's a new

00:42:53,530 --> 00:43:00,220
edition not nothing big but it helps you

00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,000
get around in your network I mentioned

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,700
at the end

00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
so software-defined networking is

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,620
supposed to make lives easier but often

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,990
care is it doesn't often carries you

00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:13,620
have your Sdn everything is configured

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:16,030
but some stuff is not working right

00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,700
that's what happens right I mean can

00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,590
happen so with nary you have a second

00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,320
channel so to speak to discover the

00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:26,860
network and verify whether what your Sdn

00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:30,040
is showing is actually the truth and how

00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:33,130
this is done nettie discovers the whole

00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,430
network and it discovers or reads all

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,320
the interface counters of all interfaces

00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,360
maybe not every five minutes because

00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,430
that would also create a lot of other

00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,250
problems but even if you get all

00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:47,850
interface counters every hour you still

00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,620
get a lot of insight in your network and

00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:53,350
can find problems that you maybe not

00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,020
even monitoring because you didn't know

00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:59,170
about it again native control network

00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,780
maps prettier ones here with all the

00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:04,030
phones and Printers so you can check

00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:08,010
whether this is also what your Sdn sees

00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:10,150
and yeah ok this is

00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:16,110
redundant Kasasa with the layer three

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:19,240
Maps already but having said this Neddy

00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,520
obviously is old so I need of course to

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,880
look at other stuff that's going on and

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,790
there is new tools coming up non SNMP

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,600
tools or other tools doing SNMP but

00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:33,460
differently maybe so a partner in

00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:37,990
Switzerland asked me to look into log

00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:40,270
stash log stash has an SNMP polar and he

00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:44,560
wanted to sort of marry the two and see

00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:46,210
if we can go to create something new so

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,570
as we learned so far

00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:52,990
Nady discovers the network with SNMP SSH

00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:56,170
some part rest and it does that for a

00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:59,500
network lock stash on the other hand can

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,720
do SNMP but doesn't know about all the

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,960
details Neddie is aware of so how do we

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,930
connect them to I created a script it's

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,970
called the stache' which you can run

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:13,330
against an ad database you can select

00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:16,590
devices you want to move into log stash

00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:20,410
and tell the log stash SNMP polar sorry

00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:23,200
tell the log stash SNMP polar to monitor

00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:26,170
all those things that are of interest

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,120
and put the results in log stash and

00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,280
this can be done every five minutes it

00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,770
depends on how powerful that SNMP

00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,320
collector is but so far the tests have

00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,750
been very successful yeah so we'll see

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,430
what it is going but again I'm open for

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:44,460
new things and see where we can go -

00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,930
last but not least nadie has an atom

00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,880
it's the cable management because I

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:52,000
mentioned the optical transceiver things

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,910
the interfaces the computers so it might

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,460
be nice to improve documentation by

00:45:54,910 --> 00:46:00,250
adding cable management and what I

00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:03,400
didn't say before Neddie can be aware of

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,560
your racks if you configure the switches

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,150
properly it will be drawn for you

00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,370
automatically you don't have to do much

00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,440
else then configure your switches and

00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,690
then you get where they are in the rack

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,140
all you need to do now is add in patch

00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:19,960
panels to your racks and then you can

00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,700
add cabling like that and then you see

00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,339
the whole connection from

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,829
to be in your network if you start

00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:29,980
documenting the cable and you stop here

00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:31,839
if Nettie finds another device on the

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,880
other end of the cable it will draw it

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,869
and add it in your cable view

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:42,069
automatically so this is also again how

00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:45,099
we add additional value to tools that of

00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:46,599
course this is not the only cable

00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:48,730
management there is and probably there

00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,530
is even better ones but this one can

00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,770
actually leverage whatever Nettie knows

00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:58,119
about your network and again I managed

00:46:53,770 --> 00:47:00,250
to put that into 3d d3.js maps and we

00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,530
see here two patch panels the

00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:04,630
infrastructure cabling in between which

00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,700
is screen because we don't have a lot of

00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,740
cables connected to it like there's this

00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,660
one switch but here this one is orange

00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,599
meaning we have a lot more connections

00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:16,119
on that building and maybe we should add

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:21,490
more fiber to the building to make sure

00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:23,819
that we don't run out of them so we have

00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,660
10 more minutes but I'm wrapping up now

00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:28,930
maybe if you want to ask questions

00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,460
afterwards then we have some time so to

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,390
make it quick

00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:37,299
Nettie that's what you get out of it and

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:39,280
I guess that's also the reason I'm still

00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:41,980
here I'm not competing directly against

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:48,549
other products in addition I can provide

00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:51,250
a cable management ya can help maybe it

00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:53,500
doesn't but it should help to avoid

00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:59,550
those kind of expressions on your face

00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:06,640
and maybe have more of those thank you

00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:11,900
[Applause]

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:14,289
all right it's question time I would

00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,150
have a question myself first

00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:19,970
so Nettie is an open source - all right

00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:22,010
so is there gonna stay open source is is

00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,589
gonna be for everyone in the future as

00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,359
well yes yes that's what was part of my

00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:28,160
premise when I started my business I

00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,530
mean it's always it's not that easy to

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,359
make a living of open source right

00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:35,569
because if it's free you I pay for it

00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:38,990
but I will stick to the model that the

00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:40,789
latest version that's still you pay for

00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:43,819
it or actually you pay for the support

00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:47,119
and providing and then the last year's

00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:48,859
version will be free and yeah of course

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:53,990
stay open source that's the way it's

00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:56,260
supposed to be any questions from the

00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,260
audience

00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:11,000
I just visited the website and I try to

00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:14,350
figure out an easy way to stay up to

00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,770
date is there some kind of newsletter I

00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:23,180
try not to spam there is a new section

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:25,460
but obviously it's not but when was the

00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:33,470
latest post I don't even remember I've

00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:35,090
been well yeah that's the event I put in

00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,700
last week because I couldn't get around

00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:40,340
earlier it's horrible I know I had a lot

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:43,760
of stuff to do and I hope it's gonna bet

00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,030
get better by the end of the year so

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,560
when I catch up with all my projects and

00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:51,530
usually there is a new section I will

00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:55,490
post in facebook and well Google+

00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:58,010
doesn't exist anymore right but yeah I

00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,750
guess I have to catch up on that good

00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:06,170
point

00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:08,690
thank you only a small question is it

00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,880
possible to monitoring or include sound

00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:16,280
devices also yes there is support for

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:19,010
brocade switches already and we not to a

00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,740
lot of depths but there is a new request

00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:26,230
to get like the fibre channel specific

00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,230
counters out of it as well so yeah

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:39,560
for all this Auto discovering well

00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:43,640
discovering it's definitely necessary to

00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:46,850
have SNMP communities of the switches

00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:51,110
you're asking isn't it yeah so you need

00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:53,330
at least one for the next hope yes okay

00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,270
yeah so it's not possible to sniff

00:50:53,330 --> 00:51:00,860
around in a network where you're not an

00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:02,300
administrator not with native things not

00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,730
with Neddie directly but you can always

00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:08,780
use Wireshark and or TCP dump and then

00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:11,680
feed it into net maybe you could think

00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,680
about automating that

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:30,560
which particles do you use - for the

00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:32,990
lair - discovery like CDB lldp FTP the

00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,990
foundry discovery protocol but I think

00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:39,230
more and more is moving to LDP with all

00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:42,740
the good and bad aspects to it but I try

00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:45,140
to support all possible implementations

00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,900
which is not easy but it's it's a good

00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:51,110
thing that when it's in and this also

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:53,120
means that a lot of the phones are using

00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,830
LDPE but it's really hard to catch them

00:51:53,120 --> 00:52:06,830
all but I'm working on it

00:51:54,830 --> 00:52:11,810
so yeah yeah there is some functionality

00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:14,330
on per villain spanning trees we need to

00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,680
look at the map itself but there's table

00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,780
view as well where you can select the

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,260
spanning the villain and then it will

00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,820
display the ports in this villain but

00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:27,170
for the map it's a bit more complicated

00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:33,110
so if you want that we should perhaps

00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:35,270
look at it I guess same actually for

00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:51,050
MSTP right because you can have several

00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:51,320
instances and would be good I know all

00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:57,960
right

00:52:51,320 --> 00:53:08,790
I think - the coffee break thank you

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:08,790
[Music]

00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,150
you

00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,150
