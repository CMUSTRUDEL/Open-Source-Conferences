Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	NeDi is an open source software tool which discovers, maps and inventories your network devices and tracks connected end-nodes. It contains a lot of features in a user-friendly GUI for managing enterprise networks. When the project started around 18 years ago, there was not much else around. With many successful open source projects appearing in the meantime, it’s a different story today. So why is NeDi still alive and kicking?
