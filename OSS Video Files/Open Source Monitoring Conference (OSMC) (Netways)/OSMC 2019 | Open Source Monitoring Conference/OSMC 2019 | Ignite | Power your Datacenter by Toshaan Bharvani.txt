	00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:20,980
so I was in the previous presentation

00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:23,050
about power systems and I send band yeah

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,849
I sent burned a message let's let me do

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,099
an ignite about power so you have a

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:31,689
little bit more information so yeah

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:34,240
power your DC I believe in in build your

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:37,270
own data center I like building stuff I

00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,950
do a lot of stuff with hardware you can

00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,690
build your own cloud if you prefer the

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:43,360
word cloud in place of data center same

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,130
thing more or less we have a lot of

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,410
open-source software we had the open

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,180
source monitoring conference so but do

00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,900
we actually have real open source

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,520
hardware and most people who work in the

00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,300
IT business and know the Intel hardware

00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:02,050
it isn't open source most of the other

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:05,350
open source hardware is also not really

00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,240
fully open source open power is now

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,729
fully open source even the

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,409
specifications are online on github you

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:13,119
can just download it you can build your

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,469
own processor you can build your own

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,579
motherboard you can build your own

00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:21,100
server that's available for the power 8

00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,729
and the power 9 the main difference

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,700
between the two

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,679
well between this open world is that

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,679
it's a RISC processor so it's a reduced

00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:32,920
instruction set which means that it

00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:36,520
needs a lot of additional layers or

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,149
additional things typically it used

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,659
exist in the big endian world today it's

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:45,520
by engine so it does also little engine

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,490
most of the Linux distributions are

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,359
little endian the Intel world is little

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,539
endian so you have a lot of

00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:56,319
compatibility with it another advantage

00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:58,299
is that you have much more scalability

00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,369
in these so you have typically two

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,499
socket or four socket machines you have

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:07,240
about 12 cores and you can have up to

00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:09,880
192 threads or 384 threads the opal is

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,610
the bootloader it's fully open source

00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,440
again on github basically you do IP

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,960
Elling for people who

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,360
are old enough they know what that means

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,550
you have dense kyboot which is basically

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,800
booting a polio machine and initializing

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,300
each hardware component and then you

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,550
have pity boot which is basically a

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,530
Linux kernel running and at that point

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,830
the Linux kernel will run whichever

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,600
kernel you want your distribution kernel

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,610
basically on the management node you

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,710
have the open BMC so people who in the

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,660
previous presentation saw that you can

00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,310
do a lot of monitoring on it

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,870
but it's fully open source so you can

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,510
actually write your own code in there

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,520
you can change all the logos to your own

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,990
logos if you prefer that you can even

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,720
compile it yourself and run it yourself

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:59,380
on it typically you have two types of

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,880
machine scale out and scale up that's

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,920
basically the difference between the

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,960
number of sockets so you even have

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,930
little machines with one socket which

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,000
you can buy so wraptor engineering

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,010
actually has a machine called the blank

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,240
bird which you can buy for a few

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,380
thousand euros and it's fully open

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,390
source you can do all your

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,010
experimentation on it they even give you

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,050
reserved chip so if you break anything

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,170
you can actually repair it yourself if

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,570
you know how to do it you saw a lot of

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,150
big players in there they have all or

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,650
they're all busy with power these are

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,930
the distributions which are typically

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,120
available the ones in bold are the ones

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,980
that are more supported which is

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,320
typically the little endian months

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,510
because that's more compliant with the

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Intel world so KVM pod man docker Alexei

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,239
you have all possibilities they're

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,090
typically a one host machine that's a

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,220
two socket will run about thousand VMs I

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,500
have heard stories that you can even

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,330
scale it up to 2,000 on the new ones I

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,959
haven't tested that myself but I've

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,730
tested about thousand commonly all open

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,950
source software will run on the power

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,050
machines the only thing you might have

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,150
to do is recompile so for go you need to

00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,890
recompile it if it's Python or Perl or

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,670
any scripting language it will just run

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,799
there all the other open source tools

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:22,180
web servers are typically stuff that

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:25,180
migrates very easily and you actually

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,910
have the ability to run all applications

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,380
in a more or less native way

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,310
traditionally the typical world looked

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,150
on power word databases mariadb actually

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,260
has a part which they support where they

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,350
claim that they can do 1 billion

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,630
transactions per second on a machine

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,870
which if your business is that big you

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:50,030
might want to look at that typically

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,300
like I said all open-source languages

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,430
all most of the normal interaction

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,410
languages which can be compiled compiled

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,890
very easily the only thing you need to

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,810
do is recompile your applications if you

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:06,920
want to make use of the exact hardware

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,200
accelerations you might have to make a

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,180
few patches here and there but typically

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:18,920
those are very limited I have a bunch of

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,250
them listed so there's a website you can

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,810
find more information about it thank you

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:36,639
[Applause]

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:36,639
