Title: OSMC 2019 | The Telegraf Toolbelt: It Can Do That, Really? by David McKay
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Telegraf is an agent for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.

With over 200 plugins, Telegraf can fetch metrics from a variety of sources, allowing you to build aggregations and write those metrics to InfluxDB, Prometheus, Kafka, and more.

In this talk, we will take a look at some of the lesser known, but awesome, plugins that are often overlooked; as well as how to use Telegraf for monitoring of Cloud Native systems.
