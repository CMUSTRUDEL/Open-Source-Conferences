Title: OSMC 2019 |  Tornado – Extend Icinga2 for Active and passive Monitoring
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	of complex heterogeneous IT Environments by Francesco Cina & Patrick Zambelli

The main objective of this talk is to show how you can extend an Icinga2 active monitoring with a passive monitoring engine.
With Icinga2 you focus on active monitoring. With Tornado you can do exactly the opposite and focus on passive monitoring. You receive events from different channels like SNMP Trap, Syslog, Email and match them against a rule engine and decide which action to associate. A very common use case is to set a Icinga2 Service status (critical, warning, ok) based on a matched rule. In addition you could also subscribe the Icinga API Stream and define matching rules which you would like to correlate and associate an executor for example create a new entry in Elasticsearch. Another common use case could be to register Tornado as a webhook for example in Elasticsearch Watcher collect the alarms and set the status on a Icinga Service Check. During the talk I will explain why Tornado was built from Würth Phoenix in rust and what are the common use case we would like to address with it.
