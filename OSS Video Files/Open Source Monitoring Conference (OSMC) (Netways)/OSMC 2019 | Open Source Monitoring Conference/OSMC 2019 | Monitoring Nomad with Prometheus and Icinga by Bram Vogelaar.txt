Title: OSMC 2019 | Monitoring Nomad with Prometheus and Icinga by Bram Vogelaar
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Things like Infrastructure as Code, Service Discovery and Config Management can and have helped us to quickly build and rebuild infrastructure but we haven’t nearly spend enough time to train our self to review, monitor and respond to outages. Does our platform degrade in a graceful way or what does a high cpu load really mean? What can we learn from level 1 outages to be able to run our platforms more reliably. We all love infrastructure as code, we automate everything ™. However making sure all of our infrastructure assets are monitored effectively can be slow and resource intensive multi stage process. During this talk we will investigate how we can setup and monitor a cloud native container platform that scales using hashicorp’s consul and nomad service discovery and container scheduling tools and Traefik a edge router. This talk will focus on making sure we can have alerts and metrics in this quickly changing infrastructure landscape. We’re going to show how to integrate icinga2 with consul and nomad. To finish off we´ll show how to visualize the prometheus data in a way that resembles netflix’s vizceral using freely available grafana dashboards and plugins.
