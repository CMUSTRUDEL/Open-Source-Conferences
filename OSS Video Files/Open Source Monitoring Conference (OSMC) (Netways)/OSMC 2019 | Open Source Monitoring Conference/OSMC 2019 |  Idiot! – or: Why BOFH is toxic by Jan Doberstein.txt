Title: OSMC 2019 |  Idiot! – or: Why BOFH is toxic by Jan Doberstein
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Behaviour is mirrored so as the choice of words reflects the mood and the feelings that are transported. Keeping that in mind will make you happier and with that a better colleague. How speech and behavior can have an influence on your health, your happiness, and your work – but also how others speak about you and your work. Even if you do volunteer work in open source all that count and might have influence if a user works with the product or move somewhere else. Why does that count? Because a change starts always with yourself and the internet need more love.

	00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:22,739
yes I said I'm be here and I have the

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,419
opportunity to speak non over technical

00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,340
things

00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:29,820
my name is yonder wash line and I'm a

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,820
system administrator so I'm living in an

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,010
area that you can actually name the Rust

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,100
Belt of Germany other would call it a

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,870
Metroplex or for the Germans it's known

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,659
as the loca beat so yeah I work for any

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,469
us-based company was an open core

00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:52,739
product and I do support for enterprise

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:57,449
and enterprise customers and open-source

00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:01,139
community so I communicate a lot mainly

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,989
written and in the past month I have

00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:07,350
just observed that my communication is

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,960
following social known behaviors that we

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,570
talked yesterday of this in German about

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,640
the code of conduct but it is this we

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,190
have patterns that we follow in our

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,190
communication and when you follow those

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,240
patterns and you are friendly in the

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,120
first place

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,000
the other part in that is responding to

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,750
you will respond in the same way as you

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,610
do communicate with her so we start a

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,380
conversation always with a nice greeting

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:43,350
right but why do we do this first it is

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:45,570
to make our self comfortable in any

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,460
situation and with other people also

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,290
comfortable

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,110
imagine you find yourself in a strange

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,440
place or a strength situation where you

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,500
can't get out and you are not able to

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,690
find a helpful person that offers this

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,110
service for you like a guide or

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,240
something like this so you try to open

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,229
your body language for someone that is

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,010
standing around and waving your hand or

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:17,280
signaling in any kind or in words that

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,400
you need help and that you say hi can

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,810
you help me so you try to establish a

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,290
friendly environment first

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,110
that the other person will help you the

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,150
other thing is that when you try or

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,930
begin an conversation with a nice

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,470
greeting the other person will greet you

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,930
back in the same manner if you smile at

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,030
a person the person will smile back at

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,800
you try this try this yourself go to a

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,890
bakery order your bread or whatever and

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,830
smile during that order the other person

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,049
will just smile back to you and will be

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,380
friendly to you no matter what you order

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,170
no matter what you complain about if you

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,450
are friendly with that the other person

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,500
will be friendly too

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:10,260
so as an example for that you're coming

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,680
to the bus where many old early people

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,860
are in and you have your earphones on

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,930
because it was after a long day at work

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:25,440
and you didn't want to talk to anyone

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:28,320
but you sit down and you will be an

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,140
obstacle in this bus because everyone

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,079
will be who he didn't want to talk to

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,690
anyone we leave him alone now imagine

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,239
something is happening you get a heart

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,299
attack or you break down or you need

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,200
help those people that think that you

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,209
are an obscured person that just sits

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,200
there and one do not want to talk to

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:55,230
anyone will obviously not help you as

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,040
fast as they would have when you just

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,709
greet the elderly people and say hi just

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,569
by waving the hands giving one single

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:08,970
word will make you part of this family

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:11,489
because it is actually a group of people

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,549
in a bus sitting together and you will

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:20,220
be known to them at least by a single

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey that's enough and you could just

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,510
follow this in any place and in every

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,740
time and it doesn't matter in what kind

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:35,879
of situation you are when you start a

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:40,469
conversation with a friendly smiling

00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:45,839
word it will be so that you can actually

00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:49,349
be protected imagine not that you are in

00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,860
a bus and something happened but you're

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,990
walking somewhere and you're in a

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,749
situation in a street in a city that you

00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,490
actually do not know when you are

00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:02,759
friendly to the persons and not wearing

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,189
your headphones giving every outsiders

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,779
the sick clear signal I do not want to

00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:11,550
talk to you they will probably help you

00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:14,219
help you in a situation where you need

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,649
help like because someone is pointing a

00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:20,039
gun at you or you are walking somewhere

00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:22,439
where it's dangerous overall so even in

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,259
this group here when we would have been

00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:28,439
in an area where it's dangerous in some

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,869
places people will warn you you never

00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,379
talked to before but you just greet them

00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:36,629
over here at during the conference and

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,339
they notice hey he's going over there

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,139
where it's dangerous what he should not

00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,719
go there I will warn him

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,209
they never talked to you before but they

00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:48,779
keep they have in mind that he greeted

00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:51,209
them and that you actually will be in

00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,689
dangerous in in the dangerous situation

00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:57,869
when you do this certain thing and they

00:05:54,689 --> 00:06:01,379
will try to prevent you from that so in

00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:04,800
the end a simple greeting or sim simply

00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:10,079
be friend fool to others will protect

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,479
you in some way from danger so and also

00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:19,199
a greeting will show your social status

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:21,209
over in a group imagining you come over

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,659
to a group maybe here you meet new

00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:27,929
people you meet old friends and there

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:30,929
are people that you you smile at you you

00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:33,240
hack and all is fine and then there is

00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:39,749
the single person who just refuse to

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:42,089
greet you and this is a social sign that

00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:45,149
he is not friendly to you and you will

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:47,969
just push him away and get him away and

00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,090
will probably try to solve this

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,970
situation

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,820
but overall it's a clear signal he do

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:58,710
not want to talk with you so refusing

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:02,370
and greeting is also a sign of some

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,010
relationship that you might have or not

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:09,220
so smile and greed will make your life

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,470
and life of others better because

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,590
imagine you are the person that receives

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:19,479
an order also here the waiters at the

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,450
conference greet them say thank you to

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,850
them if they just pick up your dishes or

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:28,380
whatever and they will have a better day

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,479
because they feel seen and they will be

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,389
feeling more like part of the society

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:41,800
and they are not something that is just

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:44,830
happening but wait what have this to do

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,919
with greeting it's just one part of the

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,020
social conduct right and what happened

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,880
that to do with some kind of internet

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:58,990
when we talk here over communication and

00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:01,600
I can't read someone over in an Internet

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,760
community because he can't see my hand

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:12,190
right so when you stick to such things

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:14,770
like greeting in a conversation in an

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,830
internet forum community email or

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:21,520
whatever you will transport the same

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:25,000
things means when you greet a person in

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,370
an email and you say a goodbye in the

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,979
email and you have a full sentence and

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,099
not a chat like or SMS like

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,110
communication overall you will get out

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:42,580
of this conversation with a better

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:46,390
feeling and but people tend to do chat

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,910
like conversations especially in

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,750
business cases or when you work together

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:54,520
because we have no time

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,760
it's always the case we never have time

00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,829
for anything but those ancient rules

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,920
that we have that you greet a person

00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:05,489
that you

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,609
give a conversation style communication

00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:11,579
will feel everyone better so start

00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:14,369
greeting an email it is a cultural

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:19,199
difference so over here in Europe it

00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:23,369
would be deer for name in the u.s. it

00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:26,939
would be just for name and that's it but

00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:29,519
be there and be a the shiny person be

00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:33,239
the excellent person that just do a

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,839
proper communication always greet with

00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:38,569
deer use the for name for that person it

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,629
makes the this person feel better

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:46,980
because then was a part of the code of

00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:50,579
conduct yesterday in an other cultural

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:53,999
environment just writing the for name

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:56,339
could be something like you scream at

00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,489
the person or you want to beat the

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:02,009
person it's it's rude to just write full

00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:04,859
name comma and then what you want

00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:08,100
it's like shouting at that person making

00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:11,480
that person not valuable and by just

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,980
adding dear sir can you do this please

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:19,919
give me complete conversation is more

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:23,249
friendly overall but it could be right

00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:26,869
that a written communication can be over

00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:33,720
over formal and could be extremely long

00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:39,660
imagine you write such an email it's

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:43,649
friendly yes but you know it's this

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,929
would be enough right so for your

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:51,569
information could be just beat this it's

00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:55,110
just three letters overall but having it

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:57,119
written down this way communicates more

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,480
because you value the person and it's

00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:04,999
not just giving him a paper and saying

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,999
hey take it whatever you want with that

00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:17,320
so this should be enough or be

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,390
when it is you could feel like a wimp

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,440
when you say hey this is rude what you

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,930
do here but there is a phrase over here

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,570
in Germany that you would say how you

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,760
shout out and would come back or in the

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,600
u.s. you would say you will catch more

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,330
flies with honey than vinegar right so

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,420
be friendly be the person that excels

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,970
with friendliness and you will get what

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,170
you give

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:49,180
but be of age yeah I think a few of you

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,740
were sitting here because there is this

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,690
view of edge reference right so what the

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,660
hell

00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:04,060
and a question who knows who does not

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:06,850
know what B of H means okay I will

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,160
explain it it's a reference to the

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,100
bastard operator from hell it's a

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,090
fictional route computer operator who

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:19,120
takes out his anger on users and others

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,420
to pester them with his excellence in

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,750
computer things and his expertise is

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:30,690
used against his enemies and is used to

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:34,380
manipulate his employer so he takes out

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,050
benefits because of his skills of

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,470
everything so he tries everything to

00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:44,380
make just his life better and himself

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,180
feeling better about the stupidest of

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,810
others

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,140
so that's a reference and he is

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,920
excellent in using excuses for

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,730
everything that does not matter at all

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,580
and people will not understand because

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:09,190
what could that mean it's an actual vfh

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:14,230
excuse and it's a generic excuse that

00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:16,780
might excuse the user's problem at all

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:21,370
but it must not be connected in any way

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:24,600
and that is what is happening for a

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,290
person that does not have your knowledge

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,229
overall

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,720
because usually this person comes to you

00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:36,100
because that person has a problem and

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,069
when you talk in your own terms this

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,959
person might not understand what you are

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,499
talking at all and it is the same like

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,229
this you could say hey this is not

00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:49,199
working because the sun is shining what

00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:57,789
does that mean for the user it's just

00:13:49,199 --> 00:14:00,999
generic right so overall it will leave a

00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:03,189
question mark at the users face after

00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:06,809
he's leaving your desk because he comes

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:15,609
over to you and that reminds me of this

00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:19,029
right it's it's like giving nothing out

00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:21,519
and the question is do you really want

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:29,739
to be a person that is rude to others

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:32,799
not buy or not willingly more like the

00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:34,869
way you act without thinking about what

00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,209
you do because you are in your own

00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,089
bubble you are in your own world and you

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,279
were very focused on something but for a

00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,309
person that comes over to you that is

00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,509
not part of your bubble you're speaking

00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:51,879
something you're speaking wrong tanks or

00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:56,139
whatever you will call it so you use

00:14:51,879 --> 00:15:01,329
words they do not understand and so this

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:06,189
fictional thing is for the user in the

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:08,319
end reel and myself reminds me always at

00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:09,909
this because hello i T

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:13,629
have you tried turning off and on again

00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:17,589
is a default phrase if you are working

00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:21,419
really an IT how many times all of you

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:21,419
have said this sentence to someone

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:33,020
that's another part but how many people

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:38,400
use that phrase actually okay it's true

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:40,650
but the thing is I wanted to be like to

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:45,000
be of age when I was young when I was a

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:47,700
starter it was a hero for me it was a

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:55,140
person I admire and I want to be exactly

00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:57,930
like that and over time I was in the

00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:03,150
other part so I was a person that needed

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,430
help and the other guy or whoever person

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,550
that was it was just a mailing list but

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:13,920
this person behaves like to be of age

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:19,320
and put the mirror in front of me and so

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,620
I I thought always that need to be you

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:31,410
should always think what you do and what

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:32,420
you how you act to others right you got

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,390
it

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:40,770
the point is always speak with people in

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:43,950
a professional manner means always act

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,740
like you would have another person

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,990
helping you that this person should act

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,720
always put the mirror in front of you

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:55,709
and think I am I the person I would

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,190
expect any other part that is what you

00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:02,100
should do no matter if it is a paid

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,319
service you offer if it is company

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,839
internal or if you do open source

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,589
contribution when you are a national

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:14,160
 over at github issues or at PRS

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:15,870
it will mirror back to you and in the

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,500
end it could mirror over back to your

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:21,540
company because the company might have a

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,800
code of conduct and you are not

00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,800
following this because you are not

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:29,070
professional over to users who spend

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,730
their free time their spare time to help

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,730
your product

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:40,950
and it means that people will always

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:44,820
judge what you write and we know all the

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,580
internet does not forget anything I can

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,750
find my own postings to a Sousa mailing

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,059
lists that are back 20 years now and I

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:58,170
see the I have written there and I

00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:01,020
just it's not nice to see what you have

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:06,960
written there and how you argued with

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:09,780
your it's it's not nice Google yourself

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,300
and go back to the last page just do

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,850
this when you have ever communicated in

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,030
mailing lists with your clear name or

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:20,820
use your PGP ID and look back where you

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:25,410
find this in any conversation there are

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:29,330
archives of anything so do this because

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:32,580
what is happening people will develop

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:36,300
emotions just when they read your name

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,540
they develop emotions they will have any

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:44,990
moment they see your avatar they will

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:47,940
develop some kind of behavior that

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:53,250
reflects what you have written somewhere

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,500
I as I said I do support the community

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,710
and I write a lot and in community board

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,170
and I always say okay I will invest as

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,360
much time as the person that asked the

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,910
question and invested in a question to

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,230
answer the question so it's just one

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,270
sentence without a greeting and

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:13,830
everything my answer will be one

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:17,070
sentence and if that is actually more

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:19,290
and the user invested time to display

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,380
what he has done what the problem is and

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,450
what he had tried and where he has

00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,880
actually a problem to understand the

00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:29,520
issue then I will invest the same amount

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:33,420
of time to explain the problem to him

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:37,530
when I'm able to and that is something

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,370
that you should have always in mind be

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:43,260
no dick right because it's a boomerang

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,000
when you are dick to people they will

00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,960
act the same when you are in the

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,320
situation that you

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,429
hell no matter if it's over here in a

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,139
venue at a conference or it is somewhere

00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,169
in the internet it does not matter

00:19:55,139 --> 00:20:01,619
because there are people out here that

00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:04,889
know me from Twitter or wherever they

00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:07,740
have a certain picture in mind and when

00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:10,919
I'm acting like a dick on Twitter they

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,369
think I'm really this person it does not

00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,220
matter if I am the person or if I have

00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:21,240
it's just an humor account that just

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,749
always argues with dick arguments it's

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,509
connected to me as a person so it comes

00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:34,559
back everything you do comes back to you

00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:37,789
and the thing is you can't always be

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,519
friendly right you are in a bad mood you

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:44,249
have a hell of a day you had on calls

00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:47,850
going whatever you didn't slept your

00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:51,749
child is sick and you are really on a

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:54,539
top level and someone is asking a really

00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:57,360
stupid question and when you reflect

00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:00,389
yourself during you type in the answer

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,169
saying just read the menu you

00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:08,460
should just stop stop step back because

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:12,090
it's important that you look for

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:15,179
yourself that you start reflecting what

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:18,509
you do because when you are in a bad

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:21,869
mood and bring that down in a written

00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:23,690
way it will come back to you I find

00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:28,529
myself in a situation that I just

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,340
answered during a flyover in an airport

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:33,119
or whatever

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:36,240
- very rude to use a question and that

00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:39,960
user just reflect that back and shouted

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,600
at me and blame me really and it was

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,659
good because that showed me it was wrong

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,690
what I did and that is one of the

00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,970
reasons for this talk right because I I

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,850
had a red eyed fly and I didn't feel

00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:56,490
well and I thought I can answer just

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,140
this questions but I wasn't in the mood

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,500
for that so give yourself the time

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,049
to step back you can't help everyone and

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,000
you didn't have the time for that and

00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:13,929
you need to be in a right mood to help

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,350
others so ask yourself always before you

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:21,520
write something and before you act like

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:24,730
a me of age do I really want to be the

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,150
colleague that is acting like the bureau

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:31,090
of age shouting at people sending them

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,840
over to the basement and looking for a

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:37,690
Wi-Fi cable or something like that

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,790
because when you do this it's funny

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,450
maybe when you have a trainee or

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:48,309
something like that but it will come

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:50,290
back to you in some way and you must ask

00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,470
yourself always do I want to be that

00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:56,260
person or do I want to have that person

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,580
in front of me do I want that they act

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,440
to me like this

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,440
because it will always come back and

00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,929
what would you tell that person that is

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:12,120
acting like a be of age what will you

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:15,130
tell their this person who is just

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,470
randomly shouting at people giving them

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,130
nonsense answers what would you tell

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:24,660
that person when it's a colleague of you

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:28,299
and when you have that answer always

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,280
follow that advice for yourself that is

00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,140
the important thing that is nothing that

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,850
we can answer here in this round because

00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:38,830
everyone is different it is you have

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,540
different humors you have different

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,299
societies where you are living in you

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,179
have different bubbles and what might be

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:49,450
okay in one company shouting at each

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:53,350
other building a toxic environment it's

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:56,380
okay for some people yes but for some

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,720
not and always decide where you want to

00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:01,090
be and it might be good that you are

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,450
just a person that excels with a good

00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,490
behavior and that always bring a smile

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,860
in the room and say hey guys how are you

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:12,519
going or better hey you're all because

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:19,359
we want to be fair to all other

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:24,029
genders right so if you feel angry

00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:28,029
yourself do not communicate at all or

00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:31,299
ask someone to prove your communication

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:33,190
before you send it out if you really

00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:37,179
need to communicate when you are angry

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:39,849
or in a bad mood when you do support or

00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,679
when you do something that needs

00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:43,929
communication at all it does not need to

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,849
be supported could be sales or marketing

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:48,009
or whatever when you need to communicate

00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:51,219
your force but you are in a bad mood

00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:53,409
always take a second pair of eyes to

00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:56,739
read what you have written and want to

00:24:53,409 --> 00:25:00,570
send out do not send that out blindly it

00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:05,409
will come back to you but if possible

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:09,839
just step back wait sleep breathe and

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:15,029
rest before you send the answer out and

00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:16,989
what is more important oh that should

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:20,320
take care of yourself

00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:23,799
check your mood be kind to yourself and

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,499
do whatever field makes you feel better

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:31,479
at all like going to a concert might

00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:33,809
refill everything in yourself and you

00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:36,359
will get out of this in a good mood or

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,969
go to the beach drink a beer

00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:44,769
it is also good right so it does not

00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:49,299

00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:51,729
