Title: OSMC 2019 |  Idiot! – or: Why BOFH is toxic by Jan Doberstein
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Behaviour is mirrored so as the choice of words reflects the mood and the feelings that are transported. Keeping that in mind will make you happier and with that a better colleague. How speech and behavior can have an influence on your health, your happiness, and your work – but also how others speak about you and your work. Even if you do volunteer work in open source all that count and might have influence if a user works with the product or move somewhere else. Why does that count? Because a change starts always with yourself and the internet need more love.
