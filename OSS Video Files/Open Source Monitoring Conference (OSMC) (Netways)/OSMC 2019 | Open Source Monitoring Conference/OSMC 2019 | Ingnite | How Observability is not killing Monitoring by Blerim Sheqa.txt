Title: OSMC 2019 | Ingnite | How Observability is not killing Monitoring by Blerim Sheqa
Publication date: 2020-02-07
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	When the term Observability came up we were all told that we donâ€™t have to care about our systems anymore. We should move all of our infrastructure to the cloud, into containers and finally serverless will solve not only all our monitoring issues but all other things as well. Reality shows that this is not the case for most of us. While the importance of observability is given, we should not forget about everything we learned to make our monitoring suck less.

[Music]

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,139
all right hi everyone

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,879
my name is Baron and I'm going to talk

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,390
about observability and monitoring I

00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,670
work at Eisinger and there we think a

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,830
lot about monitoring from day to day

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,120
what to monitor or how to monitor things

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,150
if we should do monitoring or not and

00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,770
one day suddenly the cool kids just stop

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,140
doing monitoring they'd rather did

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:38,670
observability so there was this new

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,880
fancy word around and my turn was not

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,820
cool anymore the slides are not changing

00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:49,020
and yeah that was observability and then

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,460
then there was this this difference

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,100
between what is what is monitoring and

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,600
what it what is observability I'm just

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,280
going to start with a very short

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,140
definition since everyone has a

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,260
different understanding about what is

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,579
what and how they behave from each other

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,960
starting with monitoring it's basically

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,880
something where you check from the

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,249
outside the state or the resource of

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,200
thumb of something and you rather don't

00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:15,420
know what is inside of the application

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,459
how it is behaving and what it is doing

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,490
you just have this view from the outside

00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,799
this is why also many people refer to it

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,560
as blackbox monitoring so just

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,850
collecting states and resources

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,229
monitoring has evolved from time to time

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,179
so nowadays it's much more than this but

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,639
still many people think monitoring is

00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:37,619
just blackbox monitoring looking from

00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,829
the outside without knowing what is

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,319
actually running in there observer

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,719
ability on the other side is more like

00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,659
looking inside of the box so how is the

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,459
application behaving internally what are

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,310
the function calls doing where are these

00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,289
tech traces how do the metrics look like

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,289
so instead of just looking from the

00:01:55,289 --> 00:02:00,149
outside of the box you rather focus on

00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,759
looking what is happening inside of the

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,789
application so working together with

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,719
your developers is a nice thing here if

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,719
you have that control

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,670
sorry for that it's the changing slides

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,080
so yeah now start thinking about how was

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,060
how was the world before observability

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,090
is is it really new or is it something

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,460
we just discovered and the first thing I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,010
remember is when I started working as a

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,650
systems engineer 10 years ago what we

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,840
did back then is as the operators we

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,390
work together with our developers and

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,250
they wrote some metrics into a my sequel

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,170
database which was strange we moved them

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,690
from my sequel to our our D files and

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,270
visualized those data with cacti and

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,010
even mrtg before if somebody still

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,230
remembers that

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,240
so this taught me the importance of

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,790
metrics which is a crucial part of

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,790
observability of observability nowadays

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,280
storing these metrics will help you

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,950
mostly when debugging things so when

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,540
something you know is not working to dig

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,190
deeper instead of just knowing that it's

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,960
not working but there are so many things

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,670
out there where you don't have the

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,380
control of changing the application to

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,800
provide the sufficient metrics you need

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,360
like network devices switches routers

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,760
sensors hardware in general or

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,800
third-party software there is a high

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,900
variety of software and hardware in your

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,870
infrastructure that you cannot change

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,790
just to get the metrics you need so

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,090
diverse technology requires diverse

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,320
monitoring and therefore we have many

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,240
different things that we don't

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,760
understand but we have to monitor them

00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,090
and we still try to keep the simple

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,150
things simple by using all of these data

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,490
and visualizing them not only in graphs

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,740
but rather create more like dashboards

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,750
for the single view where you don't

00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,000
because no nobody has the time to watch

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,830
graphs all the day to find the errors so

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,750
you rather create some dashboards some

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,580
nice dashboards that just show you is it

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,270
working or not is it failing or is it

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,180
warning or is it ok and you based on

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,830
this data we can also do alerting so why

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,630
not we have the current state and we can

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,990
use the same mechanism that we used

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,609
before with our observability tools to

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,729
drive our alerts as well and this is

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,520
actually a really nice approach to do so

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,960
if you have the data but at that point I

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,199
came to the question if

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,440
if this is still observability or are we

00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:35,340
at monitoring again is this some kind of

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,169
wrap-up mix-up so in doing right the two

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,870
technologies are the two approaches they

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,789
somehow merge and blur into something

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,080
that is not really defined into one

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:47,280
single pattern or one single one single

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,009
marketing slogan or something it's just

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,960
the approach that we use to actually

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:54,060
monitor or observe or check or whatever

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,330
the things that we that we need

00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,539
so my conclusion here is that we rather

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,460
should focus on on the things that we

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,160
try to achieve all the things that we

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,229
actually want to do instead of following

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,740
some market terms and marketing slogans

00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:13,229
and what else and the yeah and going

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,970
behind the cool kids that that have

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,070
something new because sometimes it's not

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,320
new it's just something we used to do

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,500
before under a new term thank you very

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,500
much

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:35,079
