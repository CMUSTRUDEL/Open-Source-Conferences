Title: OSMC 2019 |  Grafana Loki: Like Prometheus, but for Logs by Ganesh Vernekar
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate, as it does not index the contents of the logs, but rather labels for each log stream. Loki initially targets Kubernetes logging, using Prometheus service discovery to gather labels and metadata about log streams. By using the same index and labels as Prometheus, Loki enables you to easily switch between metrics and logs, enhancing observability and streamlining the incident response process â€“ a workflow we have built into the latest version of Grafana. In this talk we will discuss the motivation behind Loki, its design and architecture, and what the future holds. Its early days, but so far the response to the project has been overwhelming, with more the 6.5k GitHub stars and over 12hrs at the top spot on Hacker News. Loki is an opensource project, Apache licensed.
