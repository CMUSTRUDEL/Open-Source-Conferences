Description: 
	on an Angular/Symfony (JavaScript/PHP) stack by Jonas Verhofsté

Research done at Inuits towards the distributed tracing possibilities for a JavaScript/PHP-stack, more specifically the Angular and Symfony frameworks. Manual implementation were too time consuming, so research towards auto instrumentation through dependency injection on both frameworks was done. Tools researched include Zipkin, OpenTracing (Jaeger), OpenCensus and we also had a quick look at Elastic APM.
