Title: OSMC 2019 | Rollout all your Prometheus exporters with Puppet! by Tim Meusel
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Everybody loves Prometheus. Many exporters are available to gather specific data. You can download the binaries from GitHub, start them and they will expose data via plain HTTP, without any firewalling or authentication. That would just complicate the whole setup! This is how the usual installation guide looks. It works, but it doesn’t cover all the important parts a systems engineer loves.

– What about authentication?
– What about firewalling?
– How can we make the Prometheus server aware of the exporters?
– How do we integrate custom applications that also provide prometheus compatible metrics?

A secure and automated rollout of exporters isn’t easy. Also an authenticated connection from the prometheus server to the exporters requires some preparation. This talk will cover a proper concept and all details to rollout multiple exporters to many systems, completely automated with Puppet.
