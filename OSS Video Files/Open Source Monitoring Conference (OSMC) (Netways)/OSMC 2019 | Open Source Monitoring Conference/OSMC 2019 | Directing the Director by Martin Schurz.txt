Title: OSMC 2019 | Directing the Director by Martin Schurz
Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	I will show how we designed our new central monitoring system based on Icinga2. Currently we are in the process of migrating our projects to this new system. While doing this, our teams learn a lot of new stuff and discover solutions to their specific problems. After describing, how we share our acquired knowledge to all teams, I will give a closer insight in one particular approach where we used Ansible to provision all our Icinga configuration via the Director interface.
