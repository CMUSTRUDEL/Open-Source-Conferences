Publication date: 2019-11-18
Playlist: OSMC 2019 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Naemon is the engine of several opensource monitoring solutions. This talk will take a look at whatâ€™s new in and around Naemon. I will try to answer questions like, what is a NEB module and what can it do for me? What are common addons and tools used together with Naemon. While investigating some interesing scenarios i will share some best practices, for example the LMD livestatus proxy or the new Mod-Gearman worker.
