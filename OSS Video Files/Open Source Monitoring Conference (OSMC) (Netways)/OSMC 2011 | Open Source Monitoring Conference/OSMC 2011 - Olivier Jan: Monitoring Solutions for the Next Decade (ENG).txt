Title: OSMC 2011 - Olivier Jan: Monitoring Solutions for the Next Decade (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Olivier Jan

For now, open source monitoring has been focused on technical monitoring. That's good but not enough because of the new importance of the monitoring process in enterprises (ITIL). So, during the speech I'll explore the new ways and possibilities to conduct a more business-oriented approach to monitoring and achieve a complete monitoring cycle in enterprises. A monitoring that will fit technicians as well as businessmen. We are now facing very distributed information systems (virtualization, cloud computing) that makes technical monitoring more difficult to achieve (no possibility, for example to install an agent in the cloud). Furthermore I will talk about end user experiences about monitoring or behaviour driven monitoring, log centralization and management and its transition.
