Title: OSMC 2011 Georg Kostner: Safed as an agent to support a central collection of events with SYSLOG ENG
Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Georg Kostner

The SYSLOG protocol with a central Syslog server (rsyslog, syslog-ng) is often used as a central collection or monitoring point for log information such as Microsoft events, log files in Linux. WÃ¼rth Phoenix developed upon Safed under GPL, adding features based on Snare and Epilog to round off the software's capabilities in the open source environment. From the two Snare and Epilog agents, a single Safed agent with extended functionality was created.

 

This presentation will look at the software's new capabilities resulting from this project, and introduce Safed's open configuration interface which enables its integration into a central configuration system.
