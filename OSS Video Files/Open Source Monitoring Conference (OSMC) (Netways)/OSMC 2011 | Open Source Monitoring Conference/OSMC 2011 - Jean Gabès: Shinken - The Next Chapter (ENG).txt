Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Jean Gabès

Shinken is a Nagios re-implementation that focuses on large environments with an advanced architecture and amazing performance. It is completely Nagios compatible and premiered last year. It's also now in use in production environments.

 

The core functionalities and distributed architecture are now complete, but the IT world is still evolving, and so too does the monitoring one. In this presentation we will discuss all of these new developments like the on-core business rules and the business impacts. There will be also a presentation of the new Shinken UI and the administration CLI tool.
