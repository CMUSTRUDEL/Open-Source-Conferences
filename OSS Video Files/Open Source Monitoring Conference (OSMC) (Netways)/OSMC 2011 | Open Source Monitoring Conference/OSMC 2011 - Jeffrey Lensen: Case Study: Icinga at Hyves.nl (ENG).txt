Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Jeffrey Lensen

Hyves.nl runs on nearly 3000 servers, all of which need to be monitored properly. Jeffrey will explain how Hyves.nl uses Puppet to automatically configure the entire Icinga cluster to ensure a complete monitoring configuration. He will also talk about how they've integrated Icinga into some of the other tools used, with the help of MK Livestatus and the Icinga API. Finally Jeffrey will demonstrate some of their custom-made tools for controlling and requesting status information from Icinga.
