Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Remo Rickli

The original focus of NeDi was to discover the network and automagically keep track of any kind of networked nodes. It leveraged information stored on networking devices to dynamically visualize and document the network infrastructure. With the recent integration of Google-Maps many new possibilities arise in terms of network monitoring and operational simplification.
