Title: OSMC 2011 - Michael Medin: Distributed Monitoring Using NSClient++ (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2011 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Speaker: Michael Medin

Distributed monitoring is often a mixed bunch of solutions and protocols. With NSClient++ we have a vision of a unified single solution, not only regardless of if you are on Windows, Linux or Solaris but more importantly also regardless of if you are using passive, active or a combination to distribute your checks. Thus, we have started on a distributed mechanism where you can both send commands and check results as well as receive them as well as distribute configuration.

This session will offer a quick introduction to these concepts and how you can use the building blocks to build a distributed check framework of your own.
