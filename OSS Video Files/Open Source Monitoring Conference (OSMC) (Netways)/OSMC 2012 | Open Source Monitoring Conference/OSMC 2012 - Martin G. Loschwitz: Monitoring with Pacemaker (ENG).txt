Title: OSMC 2012 - Martin G. Loschwitz: Monitoring with Pacemaker (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Pacemaker has become the de-facto cluster management solution for Linux-based High Availability clusters. Many administrators, however, don't leverage its exciting monitoring feature, which allows for seamless automatic restarts of previously failed resources. This presentation explains how Pacemaker's monitoring feature works and how system operators can make the most out of it. It also demonstrates how resource agents -- Pacemaker's main interface to all the services running within a cluster -- can be adopted to support more extensive monitoring features and take care of problems before they become critical. The examples given will deal with existing as well as newly-written resource agents. Last but not least, this presentation demonstrates best-practice setups with Pacemaker's monitoring feature enabled, based on the VirtualDomain and the Asterisk resource agent.
