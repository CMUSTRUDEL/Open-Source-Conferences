Title: OSMC 2012 - Mike Adolphs: Monitoring Behavioral Driven Infrastructures with Cucumber-Nagios (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	IT infrastructures are growing in complexity all the time, which is why it is becoming more and more important to ensure the functionality of services rather than just be able to monitor their general status. What use is a perfectly configured webserver if it always supplies the wrong content? Lindsay Holmwood's Nagios plugin cucumber-nagios is now on hand to solve this problem by providing a simple way of monitoring system behavior via integration testing.

This presentation provides insights into "behavioral driven infrastructure", explains the basics of cucumber and cucumber-nagios as well as showing features by way of a live example.
