Title: OSMC 2012 - Pierre Wallemaqc: PMp - another approach to configure Nagios (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	PMp is a pro-active configuration software suite that helps managing your monitoring setup. PMP is designed to scan IP's network and build automatically appropriate monitoring configurations. PMP leaves the end user free to decide what will be visible in the Monitoring UI and how it will be monitored through an intuitive Web interface. 

Today PMp is best used in combination with OMD to configure either Icinga or Nagios software and nothing prevents it from being extended to other software.

	00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
are you all ready for the last talk

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,559
today

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,160
well let me introduce pierre he arrived

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,359
a few hours ago from belgium and we'll

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,720
show you pmp new and

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,279
is new it's threatening pretty new

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,279
 configuration front-end have fun

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,680
so good afternoon so first let me thank

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,760
you

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,920
for giving me the opportunity to come

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
here and present pmp

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,120
my name is pierre valmak i'm a network

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
engineer

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,120
for bellnet bennett is the national

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,039
research network

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,920
in belgium and i'm here to speak about

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,800
pmp with really a tools that evolved in

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,840
the year

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,840
to configure monitoring software like

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
nikes

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,479
so what do we have on the agenda for

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,520
today

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,880
so first we will go

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,439
and explain what is pmp then

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
speak about some of the decisions we

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,520
made

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
so why we choose this environment

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,720
afterwards i would like to to show you

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,080
how easy it is

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
with pmp to configure a monitoring

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,360
software

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,400
and to have a running environment in

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,079
really in a few steps

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,479
afterwards i want to to speak about

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
and to ask i to explain to answer the

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,680
questions

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,479
why why pmp uh who is pmp where do we

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
come from

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,079
where where do we come from and then

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
speak about uh

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
a little bit more about the overview of

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,759
the concept how it works the arctic 2

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,520
architecture of pmp

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,600
it's insulation where do we stand today

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,719
and speak about the road map where do we

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
want to go tomorrow

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
okay

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,800
so what is pmp

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
pmp stands for a proactive monitoring

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
platform

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,599
it's really a real-time uh

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,640
nagas configuration web application so

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,959
we decided to go for web applications

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,120
to to be certain that it's really

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,480
platform independent easy to use

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,000
you just use your browser and here we go

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
you can configure your network

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
i want you to say to that it's also it's

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
a response to

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,519
to a problem that yeah we had in our

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
network

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
it's really the challenge to have a

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,360
configuration that is

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,400
always up to date and it's easy to build

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
the the roots of this tool has to be

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,440
found in a

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
in a layer 3 environment this is

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,480
important because it's really

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,319
it's based for an icp network so

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,720
it's really yeah what it understand

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,120
the best it's really routers and a

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,319
routing environment

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,360
uh this last year we have so we have

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
been

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
pushing a lot of functionalities for

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,920
layer 2 network but

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,159
the the root of the the the tools is

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,440
really in a layer 3 environment

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,560
it has also a deep understanding

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,120
of your topology because we are reading

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,640
a lot of information from each device

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
so it's very easy afterwards to to start

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,440
and give you the topology of your

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,400
network

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,400
with this information

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
once you have all this information and

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,239
you know the topology

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,720
it's rather simple with out of out of

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
shelf

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
tools to represent it and to give you a

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
graphical

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
representation of your network

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,720
also what is very important is

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,519
this is something i'm emphatic more more

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
and more

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
it's rules based because each network is

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,560
different

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
so it's important that we can at a

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
certain time put some rules

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,560
to say okay this is how this is a

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,919
conflict i want to see and this is what

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
is important for the

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,040
for my environment that this is what i

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,280
don't want to see or

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,880
don't want to environment to the monitor

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
and what i've been putting in light gray

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
but here

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,919
it's also because we we have all

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
this information about the network about

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,600
the device

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:52,080
it's rather easy

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,960
to if you do a predict checking of your

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
network

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
to predict and to be proactive on what

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
you are what is happening in your

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
network

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
so this is something it's that i'm

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
really

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,000
focusing on on this and this tool

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,039
so know that we have a little bit more

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,320
information on

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,960
pmp i wanted to speak about really the

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,720
choice that we made

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,759
regarding the tool so pmp

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,199
is really designed

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
at the base it was really designed to

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,720
configure nagios environment

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,479
today it evolves also to configure also

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,080
an omd environment but in the beginning

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,120
it was really nagging

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,840
so why did we choose niger's because it

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,199
was really widely used

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,039
um and in my eyes it's really more than

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
nagus it's really in ecosystems

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
it's a it's a lot of tools it's a

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,720
lot of add-ons

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,600
it's a lot of really out-of-the-shelf

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,199
yeah in tools that you can or kit that

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,000
you can you really use and

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,000
put together to get your environment

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,919
um just i named here a few of them but

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,080
uh like nakvis pnp for niagaras you have

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,479
really a lot of things that are

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,000
in these ecosystems and so the idea is

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,039
really to to broaden

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,440
the picture to be able to monitor

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
uh to use the tool that you need and

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
yeah

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,319
and last but not least this is really

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
built on

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
many years of development so we were

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,759
using this environment for 10 years and

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,240
this has been evolving in the time

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
starting from small things until it

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,160
became

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
a pmp recently

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,600
so speaking about omd

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
so why did we choose omd it's because

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
really

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,599
um i yeah in this stance for open

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,639
monitoring distribution i think

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,919
many people should know it

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,199
um before we use omd we really had to

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
install a lot of tools separately and

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,919
make them

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:11,360
all work together so um

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,440
recently yeah

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
recently i discovered that and i said

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
okay that would be really nice if

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
something can just do all of this work

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,360
for me and

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
yeah i tried omd and it was really the

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
answer to this problem

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,800
to be able to integrate all the tools we

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
need

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,440
something very easy to to deploy and to

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,880
install

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,560
and it has all i most of the

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,240
the add-ons i was looking for

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
as i said this is a very recent

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,720
evolution because yeah before

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
i use the same tools but i had to really

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,440
integrate everything together and was

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,639
not

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,720
sometimes this was not easy and

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
really the nice thing i found about it

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,080
is

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
yeah i had nothing to modify nearly it's

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,560
really the conflict was there i just

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,080
plug it in there and it was running

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,039
so one config fits it all

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,520
so just to illustrate this with a few

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,520
pictures

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,240
so as you see with omd you get

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,000
nagios the gui tech mk truck

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,840
nakvis in singa and

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
shinken so you have a lot of tools that

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
are just there

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,319
and you can just use it uh really out of

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,680
the box

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,760
and what justice also this is a pnp for

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,399
negas so you get the graphs

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
you get a lot of things it's just really

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,120
yeah

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
you put your config and here it is it

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
works

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,959
so just one all the picture this is

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
all network and really to build this

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,839
it's

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,839
a few click

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,200
so to come back to our agenda i wanted

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,120
to speak about

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,320
how to introduce pmp to speak about

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,480
some of our basic choices and now i

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
wanted to to show you how easy it is

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
really

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,959
if you want to start to if you want to

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,440
start from scratch you have an

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
unknown network or you can really build

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,560
your config

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:24,160
in in a few very simple steps

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,920
so i will not make a live demo oops

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,680
so if you start the tools this is what

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
you will be presented with

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,680
so this is a blank screen

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,560
the first thing you have to do is really

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,839
first go in the settings options and

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
there in this menu you will have to

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,560
declare your groups

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,959
your users and the basic setup of your

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,959
network

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,600
so if you want to uh

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
create groups and add users this is

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,440
the the screen that you can use to do

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,279
that

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,560
uh so you have always

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,240
yeah um

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
in the the top of the screen you can

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,040
always see where you are so

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,800
here we are in settig settings groups

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
then you have a few buttons to create

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,680
users to add user to create new groups

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
to delete groups

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
and so you go in the process you create

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
your groups

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,360
you add your user into it

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,360
and when you're happy with it

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,440
then you can go in the still in the

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,480
settings in the network

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,600
and here we start to discover

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
on networks so

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
uh so in the settings you yeah you

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,200
choose

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
the auto edit to add a new network or to

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
edit one

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,760
and once this is done you present it

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
with this screen so this is the at

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,079
option so in the add options the first

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,600
thing you have to do is really

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
name your network that you want to

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,079
configure afterwards you have to link

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
your network to a group

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,519
and this is a rather recent addition

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,760
what would allow the user is to

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
create different ranges and so

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
administration ranges

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,600
and in these of uh so yeah and each

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,040
range has a name

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
so this means that if you have a network

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
and you have different many of our

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
management ranges

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,920
you can just add them one after the

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,800
other one and then

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,320
really start to uh discover each of

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,079
these ranges

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:43,839
to in your network so

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,839
you give the name of your range you give

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,240
you provide the management range the

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,560
prefix length

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,360
then the community because most of it is

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,920
based on snmp

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,040
the apartment for the the device you

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,399
want to monitor

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,040
so the name of device you want to

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
monitor and then also some patterns

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,720
of on the name of the naming of the

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,240
interface you want to

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,079
uh to include or not in your

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,760
in your skin once you've done

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,160
you've done all of this you will

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,720
start the discovery process so what do

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,600
we do then it's really

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,440
so the tool we start a small daemon that

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
will go and uh

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
process each of the ip address in the

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,839
range you have been providing

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,079
and each time he does a ping and then

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,200
goes with snmp try to find

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,560
all the information he needs to uh

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah to put this in his catalog

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,639
so this is yeah rather simple

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,279
it just take uh like a few minutes to

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
discover

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,880
all your range and afterwards you

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
provide it here with the list of all

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
your devices

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,200
in the range you are discovering so once

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,320
this is done you have just to say okay

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,360
save and your your range of devices all

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
your devices

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
i just saved uh in the background for

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,839
you

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,959
so let's say we have done this we have

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,839
our network now is ready we want to

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,120
to go further and start to really build

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,399
a configuration

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,920
what you will have to do is

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,639
you will have to go in the operation

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
part of the network of the of the tools

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,160
and then

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,440
select the network you want to uh

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,079
to monitor and then you see on the left

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
side

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,360
you have all the devices that were

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
discovered

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,440
discovered during the discovering

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,199
operation so for each of this device

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,839
then you will have to

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,399
uh use the refresh button so then the

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,320
tools

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,560
will go on this device and really

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
read a lot of mips and get all the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,360
information on this device

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,399
so dbgp uspf cdp

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,160
and the information that we

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,480
are fetching there is depending on

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,120
really the brand of the device also

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,279
because not all the device supports the

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,079
same feature

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,959
so you do this and so for every device

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,639
you go you do your refresh

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,760
and you connect all the information from

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,959
this uh from this device

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,880
um yeah some calendar hidden but

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,880
yeah um so there you will

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
you will see so for each of each of the

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,399
interface on the device

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
you will get so it's the ip address is

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,360
configured too

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,480
and also if this one has a appear

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,839
so if we find some neighboring router

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,959
uh on this interface so for us this is

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
very important because

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
uh if we find some another device at the

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,160
other side

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,240
we know that this is a backbone link

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,600
otherwise we know that this is more like

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,120
an edge link

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
to a customer to something else

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,120
um on the right side of the screen

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,760
many information but you have then

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,440
the add to config so by default by the

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,560
rules that are integrated in the

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,199
and the tools it will select what is

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,320
the most meaningful interface to to

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,040
monitor

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
so of course uh the tools cannot know

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,079
everything so

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
if you want to override this choice you

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,959
just click on the button on the left and

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
you saw on the yeah

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,639
the and you just and unselect it and

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
then

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,839
yeah if you show selected you will see

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
that this

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
this interface has just disappeared from

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
your list

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,120
um i think this is more or less all i

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,120
had to show on this slide

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,880
so yeah so once you have done a refresh

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,360
of your complete network you have been

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,639
rediscovering everything

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
you have the opportunity because this is

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,880
really the aim of these tools

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,720
to build your config so if you hit on

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
the build config there on top of your

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,360
screen

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,079
um what will happen is that

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
the your configuration is already will

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,720
be generated

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
and it will be set in a dedicated

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
environment

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
there you can test it and if you're

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,920
happy with it you can apply it

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,480
so this means that when you apply it it

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,480
must work

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,360
so on for every interfaces we

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,639
we have a lot of flags if you want to

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,639
see the flags you have

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,240
the flag information that you

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
if you click on it you will have the

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,839
full help if you and click

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,839
it will just be reduced

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,360
once you have done all of this if you

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,440
wish you can also

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,480
uh display the topology of your network

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
as it was discovered

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:02,160
it's um so for this you go

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,839
on the topology button and then you will

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,000
with graphics it's graphics who is

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,240
building this we'll uh

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,679
just we will create a topology file

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
and graphics will just with one of the

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,199
aggregate media we've been selecting

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,120
display your graph

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,120
and this should look like this

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,600
so this is just one of the network we

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,280
are running

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,640
but of course there are a lot of

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,480
algorithm you choose the one

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,160
that best fit so yeah my idea was behind

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,200
this at one time i can grab this

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,760
information

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,679
to create the the configuration for

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,440
nekvis or something like this

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
so that was really and then

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,080
automatically

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,640
you go from your discovery and you end

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,679
up with

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
having yeah up the complete environment

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,799
running environment

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,640
with the graphs the yeah

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,840
your topology views and so on and so

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,400
forth

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,120
but it's one of the ideas not yet

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,120
finalized

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,480
so let's come back to the agenda so

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:18,000
i don't know it's more clear

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,000
what pmp does and its

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,120
advantages so now i wanted to

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,520
yeah to go more in depth why would would

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,799
one

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,200
choose pmp then use pmp

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,160
and yeah go a little bit more on the

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
history of the tool

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,880
so why would someone want to use pmp

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,640
it's for me to instantly to simplify the

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
installation

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,000
simplify the configuration process so

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
you just

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
discover your network you say build

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
config and here we go you have your

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
configuration

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
and you have your environment that is

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
your monitoring environment running

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
to simplify the maintenance process if

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,000
you want something change

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,160
it's very easy you just refresh the

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,240
information on your device

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,120
and you continue your process you build

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,960
a new config and here we go

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,640
to benefit from the expertise of the

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
tool

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,559
there are many rules many things that

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,760
are inside the tools but

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,320
so it was really

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,960
down there to to help you to have a

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,240
directly

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,080
the most efficient configuration

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
and to be sure that anything that needs

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
to be monitored is in there by the rules

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,400
you have been defined

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,840
defining and also for me

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,880
uh so far when i made the search

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,520
i found no perfect solution for my

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
problem

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,360
so it means that often it was working on

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
a device base

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,360
and many things we required development

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
to make it work so

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,400
at certain times we arrive to that

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,400
solution

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,880
so i'm a lazy so if the tools can do it

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,960
for me so it's really

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
the idea is ready to reduce the burden

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,320
of the monitoring

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,559
the tco to add flexibility

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
i know today this works with uh the

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,799
device

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,840
i had on hand so it's four stance cisco

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,960
juniper and since a few weeks months

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,960
with hp also

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
and last but not least so what i

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,880
explained before is to be proactive

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,039
if you if you start to run this

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
in the background automatically for you

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,799
on a regular basis

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,400
you can then start to to see trends of

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,159
your network you see okay

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
this is deteriorating i have this

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,960
behavior on my routing protocols

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,600
and so at a certain times you can start

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,760
then afterwards to say okay

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,039
report the problems to the user and say

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,600
okay maybe you should

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,400
take action on this site on this side so

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,799
today's uh

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,919
there are many ids it's not yet encoded

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,840
but it's really

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,840
where we want to go with this with this

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
tool

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:13,600
so who is being a pmp it's mainly me

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,799
so uh a network engineer at bennett so

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,080
we monitoring like 200 notes

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,360
today and

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:27,120
i would say me alone it wouldn't work

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,840
so it's a few friends have me helping me

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,840
to to get these things up and running

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:43,039
yep so i think it's interesting also to

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,640
to show where we are coming from and why

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,520
how we arrived there

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,640
so i many years ago

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,080
we had a niges installation

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,039
and so negis was used for

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,640
all what are all the servers and the

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,760
network

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,840
and we had what we called at that time

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,640
the watch list and this was really a

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,799
huge press

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,559
spreadsheet with a description of the

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,159
complete network

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,880
the problem with this is that this watch

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,320
list was very hard to fill it up

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,760
and to keep always up to date

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,080
so this is why afterwards we had to

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,720
find some of the ways to do things

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
afterwards

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,200
in the the next years we have been

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,600
adding a lot of things and we have been

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,919
doing

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,640
like we have funny things with this like

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,440
money monitoring multicast

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
uh also we have the notion of links

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
adding new

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,760
new features we had our own weather map

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,880
so many things were

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:52,840
done at that time but

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,080
uh nothing really on the configuration

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,120
site

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,919
and in 2008 i had um

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,880
i broke my leg so i had a lot of time

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,240
and this is how

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,240
nct started um

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,679
yeah so it was really to address the

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,559
problem of

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,440
to get the goods yeah and the good and

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,840
up-to-date

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
configuration because the thing is that

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,720
if

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
if we have to rely on people to do it

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,000
i'm sorry to say that

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,679
but sometimes it's not perfectly done or

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,520
the naming is not correct and things

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
like this so i really wanted to have a

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
tools

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
that does it for me completely and

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,559
really i have

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
two buttons to click and it was done and

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,760
so

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,960
i just started to to code that

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,200
and at that time i called it nct

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
nagios configuration tool so i had to

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,840
find a name i found one

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:52,799
and it was really mainly

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,799
two-step so

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,440
you yeah you started directly the

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
discovery

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,640
and then afterwards you build your

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,600
config so

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
it was no fancy thing it was really pure

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
html and

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
click start discovering it took really

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,880
long time

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,640
you got your configuration you say okay

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:19,840
i'm fine with it and

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,840
push it to the to the monitoring daemon

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,520
and the idea was really to make things

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:32,400
really more and more automatic

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:36,559
so not long ago

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,600
um we we thought okay it's nice to go

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,960
further than just and city density

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,400
to have a better gui um

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,600
yeah really to to make it fancier

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,000
and this is why we came with a pmp

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,200
so pmp is the idea is the same it's

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,600
really to build your configuration

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
and um to make the discovery of your

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
network

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
but really in a more user-friendly way

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,120
so

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,200
i spent a lot of time just to design the

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,360
menu to see how things where things

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,840
should be in the menu and so on so forth

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,320
just to make it as user-friendly as we

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,360
could

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,360
it was really completely rewritten

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:26,720
i'm working hard to get it open source

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,919
so to remove all things that are related

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
to the network i know and so that it can

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,600
go

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:38,640
in the open it has been yeah i got the

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,120
the permission also to make it uh open

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,679
source

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,720
so that i can give it to the community

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
yeah today we have our own website it

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,039
should be

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,159
live very quickly the ticket appliance

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,159
and so on and so forth

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,600
just to show you how it was so this was

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,440
really on the top the the first

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,360
spreadsheet we had in the beginning

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
as you see it was it was more than the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,919
network there was also like phone

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,400
information

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,000
a lot of things that was required to

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,880
operate the network

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,360
and then you had the first the really

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,799
first

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,840
capture of nct was really fancy

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,840
just a few buttons to configure your

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
network

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
so that was the the first evolution of

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,080
it trying to

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,080
have uh some uh yeah javascript in there

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,120
but yeah and this was really the first

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
first screen of pmp so how it looked

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,559
like

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
a year ago i have to say that since then

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,840
it has really

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,840
changed a lot

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,080
so to come back to our agenda so i

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,279
wanted

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,799
yeah first to introduce a little bit uh

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:09,200
pmp than to speak about our choices

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:13,440
why did uh yeah why would you need pmp

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,240
speak about people behind pmp

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,039
now i want to go a little bit more in

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
depth of

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,120
in the in the tool itself speak about

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
the installation

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,440
what are the features that are available

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,039
today

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,640
and to wrap it up

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,840
to speak about the road map and where do

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,159
we want to go

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,159
in the the coming weeks months

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,320
so yeah pmp

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,480
if you want to understand it first for

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
me the most important things you have

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,559
two points is your network for me the

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,240
network is a database

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,240
many people will just say the the

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,360
contrary but at the end

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,799
the most accurate information

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,640
is the one that is configured on your

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,200
device so this is where

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,039
we go and we fetch information and we

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,600
store it in the database

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,919
the way we will do it is is really based

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,840
on your configuration file so

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,159
you have ways to influence the way you

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
will

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,679
scan your network and the information

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,679
that will store in there

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,799
next to this every operation

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,159
from your mentoring demon and from the

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,240
pmp

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,559
pmp itself will create log files so

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,679
you can really uh i for me it's very

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,720
important that

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,520
you can see if you start uh yeah if you

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,520
start a process okay what happens and

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,720
why it happened like that so

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,600
um also yeah the heart is the config

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,399
files as well

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
so in your config files you have way to

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,600
really

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,039
set your flags a little bit like cisco

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,880
you can really say i want to debug

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,600
decency and this this and this and with

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,240
this level of

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:08,240
this criticism criticality so

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,679
for this feature i want really to see

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,919
everything on that

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,080
it can be very variables and this

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,080
information is stored in log files

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,480
and you can afterwards go and see what's

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
happened

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,760
yeah your monitoring daemon will either

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,600
have its database or status file

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
external file comment file this is the

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,960
way we used before

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,640
we worked before is if you want to

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,279
restart your demon or

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,399
send the command to your daemon that was

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,440
the command file

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,240
uh no many things are just done through

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,640
omd

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,640
itself

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,039
so the installation um two ways to do it

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,399
it's either

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,799
it will be either just a dar file

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,960
that you you install somewhere you run

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,679
setup it will tell you all the problems

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,799
or

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,960
what you need to do to have it working

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,799
and then you will have your running

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,039
environment

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:12,480
uh the idea was also to make it a as a

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,640
uh yeah a virtual machine that you can

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,520
just install somewhere on

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
on a server

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,039
it's yeah today's working on many

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,360
different environments we just tested a

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,360
few

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:36,320
yeah so what do we have

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,200
in the current release we have the

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,559
topology

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,720
it's basically discovered through ip

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,679
subnet we need also the routing protocol

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,480
to make a link between yeah it's not

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
because you have

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,240
two interfaces that i understand subnet

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,240
that it that they are adjacent

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,320
and also we use cdp because uh

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,399
for some networks where it's running

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
it's only a switching network so you

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,000
need somewhere

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,760
something to be able to make uh to link

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,559
your devices in another way

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,000
than just through ip or subnets because

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,000
when you're working with switches

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,240
it's vlan so it's you need something

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,240
else

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,279
what do we monitor today with this uh do

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,559
we build a conflict for

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,200
interfaces for your environment so

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,320
it's also it's most of a we have a lot

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
of plugins

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,120
that we used for many years so to

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,799
develop to monitor your environment so

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,679
the router environment and

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,320
report problems on this and something

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,960
that was

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,080
added recently we have in the tools

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,080
itself we have a local search engine

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,919
best is to show you how it's how it

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,120
works so for example

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,480
here it's displaying a device

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,640
and we are we would like to uh search

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,519
on all the devices in san francisco so

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,039
you just

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,480
in the search bar you just type there

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:08,480
the letters you want like s-a-n and

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,880
it will just find you any

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,320
anything where you have the string you

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,640
are looking for

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
and this is something i found quite

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,120
useful for example you have a large

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
network

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,720
and you are searching for a customer and

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,240
you know you have the customer

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,760
you have to you know three letters for

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
the customer name you just search in

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,559
there and

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,919
you get the line you get the interface

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,080
you know where this customer is

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,039
connected

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,960
so this is yeah i thought and this works

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,679
on every screen so this search bar

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,679
is everywhere

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,360
so what else do we have in the current

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,320
version something i already explained

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,200
before

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,960
so we can have a multiple management

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,640
subnet per network

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
this was really a request from a friend

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,559
of mine said okay

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,880
some devices only one subnet order

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,360
another i want to be able to manage my

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,399
network of this

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,159
as protocols out of the box today ospf

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,279
bgp those are the ones

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,000
we are using the most and the hardware i

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,080
had to update

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,440
the slide i didn't do it we have cisco

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,000
juniper 410

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,000
and hp

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
so

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,399
so i wanted to yeah to thank you for the

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,440
attention

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:31,120
and at the end of this presentation

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,799
i wanted to go quickly on

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,000
what could be the future or the next

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,000
step or the roadmap for

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,320
pmp

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:46,799
so what are we working on today

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,360
it's really the good documentation

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
so uh yeah this is something i'm really

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,240
um

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,760
i'm working with oxygen i think most of

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,120
you know about it

00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,159
and really documenting every yeah

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,720
everything so that you can have a

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:08,000
nice documentation of the code um

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,599
yeah so far it's used uh flat file so

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,919
i'm working to the database

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,480
design is done so to migrate everything

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:18,480
to a database inside

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,599
to have our website ready uh and also

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,560
some i we have been different using

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,839
different

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,119
rendering devices to to create the uh

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,879
the the html and

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,320
to have the same look and feel for every

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,800
page to have it homogeneous so that i'll

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,159
so that for yeah on every page we have

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,879
the same look and feel and everything

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,520
works

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,520
the same way

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,480
another point to be fair it's uh

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,520
more or less finished it's the

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,720
integration with

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,000
check mk because uh today we're using

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,000
plugins but the thing is that

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,640
for some in certain circumstances check

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,680
mk could be

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,720
uh really more powerful and better

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,359
so yeah i would say i've been writing a

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,000
lot of things

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,119
it's just a question to integrate it and

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
also to make some

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,200
design choices how will how will we

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,320
integrate this

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,320
in the future

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,440
uh i have another point in my mind and i

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,160
really want to go there it's also

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,640
i in a network it's really more and more

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
layered

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,440
network so you have often first your

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,160
optical network

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,280
then your layer 2 layer 3 and then on

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,400
top of that

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,079
you have your vpns so to have your

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,200
the discovery of all the vpns

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,920
and then you can really have in

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,240
in a very nice manner directly your

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,079
topology of your vpns in your network

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,280
so for example if you have a vpn between

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,200
two devices

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
you can just say okay this is my wall

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,119
this is uh this customer is from there

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,400
to there

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,000
um what else mpls check

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,640
to be fair the code is there but it's

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,839
not enabled

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,680
why do not support so hp was the thing i

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,960
wanted to add to there it's knowing the

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,280
code

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
google map i've done a lot of things

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,240
it's yeah i've tried it it's

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,800
proof of concept it works but i really

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,480
wanted to add this as well so

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
when you do the discovery of your device

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,720
and you can add your location to it and

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,119
more information in your database

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,240
and when you build your your map you can

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,320
really then uh

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
yeah i have google map for your on your

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,960
network and see

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,520
a lot of geographical representation of

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,520
your network

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
and some user interface customization

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,440
that uh

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,400
really yeah today we have a few views on

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
the network

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,440
i would really want to have a lot of

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,280
more views

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
that can be user defined

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,079
so that was it i hope

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,839
it was interesting if you have a

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,839
any questions feel free

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
questions

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,240
uh that's a good question

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,880
yeah i know it's v6 is uh at least in

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,680
the research network something really

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
more and more

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,480
used today it's not in there

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,200
um i'm not sure it's i think it's

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,599
rather easy to to add the support in

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,960
there

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,000
it's uh yeah it's just another table in

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,599
a database and

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,640
yeah another scan so yeah i think it's

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,880
it's possible just from two hands one

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,880
head

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,640
yeah sure

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,760
if you have a running uh czech and car

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,960
environment now

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,760
can you implement it and um you you have

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,880
tax

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,400
in check-in car so i can tax the host in

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,640
the web interface

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,079
to the correct group because i have i

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,440
have grouped it

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,480
yeah and there's no reason to do

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
to do the work again

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:32,720
uh yeah i agree but the thing is that

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,880
okay um i took the approach in

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,760
the other way around so the thing is

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,599
that

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,880
i had all my tools that is doing the

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,160
discovery

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
check mk has also an inventory uh that's

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,160
where you can

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,480
yeah so the my idea was at a certain

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,079
time you need to do the link in between

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,560
and this is what i'm looking for at the

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,760
moment how to build a link between

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,760
what childcare mk is doing and what my

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,119
tool is doing it's really to

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,440
so that at the end you have one yeah one

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,720
graphical place where you can

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,760
define what you want to see and

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,760
yeah and so this is

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
i'm really thinking to that because the

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,800
thing is that uh what bmp has it has a

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,920
lot of rules to

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,040
define this what is important or not

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,839
and what i was thinking is if you have

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,520
uh check mk if this is the inventory and

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,839
then you just have to tell him okay

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,040
uh this is all the things you have been

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,079
uh finding

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,280
but no the user want only two monies or

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,599
this and this and this

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,280
and all the rest is in there but you you

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,280
just don't monitor it i i'm not

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,000
interesting to see that

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,880
and i just to give you a small example

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
i'm

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,320
not long ago i was playing with a

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,920
machine it has

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:53,040
hundreds nearly thousands of interfaces

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,440
and in there you just have a few i 50 or

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
100 that you need sometimes you need to

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,000
be able to

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,040
very quickly say okay i'm not on the 950

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,640
interfaces and

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,160
all those things i'm not interested to

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,400
monitor this because

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,560
most many of them are just virtual

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,599
things so they're always up so i know

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,240
that

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,720
it's not really relevant for me maybe

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,880
some of

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,079
a few of them will be important but then

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
the user can say

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,839
okay this and this this one i want to

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,200
see not the other one and the thing is

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
that you have to be able to push that

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
back

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,760
to the checkmk and this is today i have

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,960
a few

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,200
ways to do it and i would like yeah all

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,079
ideas are good to um

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,280
to make the match in between those so

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
yeah

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,480
to be fair it's to

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,720
uh to understand how it work i've been

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,640
rewriting a few of the plugin from check

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,440
mk and so know it

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,560
how i know how it works no i'm really

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,200
wondering how can i

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,640
really um what is the best way to to

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,359
make the link in between those both

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,760
words

00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,160
that's the missing part of it but then

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,400
you have a very efficient way to uh

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,680
when you monitor everything because yeah

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,920
when you have devices that

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,880
are huge you need something very

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,160
efficient

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,119
to to work

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,119
my experience

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,280
if i understand it correctly the base of

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,319
the technology

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,599
is scanning existing networks yes

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,960
yeah can i import descriptions of

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,839
existing networks

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,880
uh let's say i have a large number 100

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,560
200 300 networks which

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,760
have to be scanned or have it

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,760
do this manually

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,280
i'm trying to so do you mean that you

00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,880
have

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,480
already the configuration or you have

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,680
the networks and you want to import i

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,119
have the networks yes

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,760
up and running for years yeah yeah and

00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:03,599
um try to import this into pmp

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,400
but to be fair it's um okay

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,200
i spoke about nct this is how nct worked

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,319
in the beginning

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,079
okay you just say okay start i was there

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,800
it took ages but it was really

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,000
discovering everything in one go

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,319
the thing is that um

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,560
a year ago i said okay nice but the

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,119
problem with this is that

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,800
if you have a very large network and

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,400
thousands of interfaces

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,560
makes then you have hundreds of

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,400
thousands of things you have to man

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,200
to to find if you start it

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,160
you really need a lot of time before you

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,480
get the information

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,280
and this is why i said okay i discovered

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,359
devices

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,880
and then if you want to discover really

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,359
each device you have to

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,359
perform it manually and um

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
the the i would say the parameter is in

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,960
the function

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
it's still there so you just have to say

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,079
true or false if you want to to do it in

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,400
one go

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,640
but if you do it in one go yeah if you

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,599
have a very large network

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,400
it will really uh eat a lot of cpu and

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,000
time but

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,480
it's doable so um yeah

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,359
this is why i know i do it device per

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,640
device but

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,000
to be fair we have like 200 devices

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,280
and you i can set up my network in

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,280
in an hour less than that from scratch

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,240
you give me a virtual machine in an hour

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,480
i have a running environment

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,280
because even the you have a setup

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,280
program

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,040
you just say okay i need this this and

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,520
this you run it

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,040
and every time you just say it will stop

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,920
if there is an issue

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,040
and when you you all go you have your

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,119
then your

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,280
um gui you have your web interface

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,480
and then uh honestly so each device

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,079
takes a few seconds

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
you click every time refresh refresh

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,400
refresh and

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,079
i would say in an hour or two i have

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,480
another environment up and running and

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,520
i've done it quite a few times

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,680
for large install based

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,480
far large no a few hundred devices so

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,480
that's not large

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,119
it's uh when you're having your network

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,119
topology

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,160
is it possible to write out the parent

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,480
child logic

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
um

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,480
it would be possible today i'm just

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,160
doing what i'm doing is i'm creating the

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,119
dot files or the yeah a topology out of

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,440
it

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,359
but uh afterwards to make this

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,800
relationship would

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,640
be rather simple uh this would be

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,240
very nice it's uh yeah

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,560
yeah it would not be uh yeah

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,520
for me it's not a problem to do it

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,359
really easily

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,599
it's uh but it's not in there

00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,599
so

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,839
are the questions

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,160
how are you handling changes on your

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,920
devices so for example if new interfaces

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,000
are popping up or going away

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,720
uh how are we handling that starting the

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,880
magnus configuration then

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,240
but that's really the next step i said i

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,760
wanted to be proactive

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,680
so today it's really um okay this is one

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,640
of the things i would like to add in the

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,920
proactive way that today you have to say

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,480
okay

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,160
i've been configuring a new interface or

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,359
a new device or anything like this

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,319
and you still have to say okay refresh

00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,520
and build a config to be fair it's two

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,119
minutes work

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,560
but it would be even better if the tools

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,839
could just say okay

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,480
i've been running this night at midnight

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,920
and

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,440
all of a sudden i see that this

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,000
interface has disappeared and this one

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,760
is gone

00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,480
it's it's arrived so this would be

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,839
yeah it would be really easy to do it

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,119
this is something i want to do it's

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,119
really to have something like

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,480
it could just be a crown tab i would say

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,599
something uh

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,599
stupid as a crown tab and with a good

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,760
command and afterwards

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,440
it brings you with a report of what is

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,760
important and what has been changed

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
and it's also a requirement i get from

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,280
some friends and say okay

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
i want just to say okay what's

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,480
deterioration on

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,079
some services something like this

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,200
something so if you run this in the

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,680
background

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,119
and every night you get a report okay

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,960
this is bad or

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,720
this is deteriorating it's very

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,440
important and

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,440
yeah so yeah it will be there but it's

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,480
not there

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,480
