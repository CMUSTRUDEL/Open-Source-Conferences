Title: OSMC 2012 - Pierre Wallemaqc: PMp - another approach to configure Nagios (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	PMp is a pro-active configuration software suite that helps managing your monitoring setup. PMP is designed to scan IP's network and build automatically appropriate monitoring configurations. PMP leaves the end user free to decide what will be visible in the Monitoring UI and how it will be monitored through an intuitive Web interface. 

Today PMp is best used in combination with OMD to configure either Icinga or Nagios software and nothing prevents it from being extended to other software.
