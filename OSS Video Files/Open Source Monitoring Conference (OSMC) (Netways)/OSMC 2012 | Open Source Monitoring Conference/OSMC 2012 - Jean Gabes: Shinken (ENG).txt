Title: OSMC 2012 - Jean Gabes: Shinken (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Compared to the well known Forks Icinga and Centron Shinken is a complete rewrite based on Python. Performance problemes in the existing core implementation of Nagios were the main motivation for Shinken. Since 2009 the project goes in its own way and focusses on global distribution with simple load balancing between different datacenters.
 

Beside the technical stuff like performance and distributed architecture the talk will focus on new added values important for a system administrator. Focus is on business impact analyses, event correlation and auto-discovery.
