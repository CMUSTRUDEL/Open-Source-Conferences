Description: 
	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Its main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research. The experiments positioned around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), require large scale computer infrastructures in order to process the data generated by the collisions. Also the control of the LHC itself relies on a complex computer infrastructure. The CERN IT department provides many different services to the staff and users, and is most importantly, the main operator of the LHC GRID. The Grid is a federation of world-wide compute facilities used to analyze all the data collected. It comprises
200 000 cores spread over 34 countries. All those large scales computer centers require a careful monitoring, but each of them has specificities which lead to different monitoring strategies and tools.
The various approaches for this challenge used at CERN will be given followed by a description of the plans for the future developments.
