Title: OSMC 2012 - Michael Medin: Distributed Monitoring mit NSClient++ (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-08
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	The biggest update ever to NSClient++ was undoubtedly 0.4.0 which was released in May this year and 0.4.1 will soon follow adding even more new features.
This new version has the potential to drastically simplify(?) how we do monitoring on both Windows and Unix. And whilst the new version is backwards compatible it can be a challenge to understand how to explore whats new.

In this session I will use a hands on approach to demonstrate the basic concepts of the new NSClient++. One of the main focuses will be real-time monitoring and how to utilize that even with "active monitoring" (NRPE).
It will describe how to setup:
* How to get started, work with configuration and most importantly: how to get help!
* Real-time log file monitoring on Linux (and Windows)
* Using active monitoring (NRPE) with real-time results
* Using various protocols such as NRPE, NSCA, NRDP, NSCP, SysLog, Graphite, SMTP, check_mk, DNSCP...
