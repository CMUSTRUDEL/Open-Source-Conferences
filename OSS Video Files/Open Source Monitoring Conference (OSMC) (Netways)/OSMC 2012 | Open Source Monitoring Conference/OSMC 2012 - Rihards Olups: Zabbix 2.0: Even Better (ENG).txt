Title: OSMC 2012 - Rihards Olups: Zabbix 2.0: Even Better (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	Zabbix is an open source monitoring solution, and it is getting more and more popular every day. Given that last appearance of Zabbix was at OSMC two years ago, shortly after Zabbix 1.8 was released, we will also look at how the remote data collector - Zabbix proxy - has progressed since then. 

This talk will cover the basic functionality that Zabbix offers for those who are not familiar with it, as well as give high level overview of massive improvements and new features that arrived with Zabbix 2.0, released in May. We will look at data collection capabilities, including native agents and direct JMX monitoring support (the new Java gateway in 2.0). We will discover the improved inventory capability and how that ties in with network maps just moments later. We will have a quick look at visualisation capabilities like graphs and network maps, with a focus on more recent map-related features.
