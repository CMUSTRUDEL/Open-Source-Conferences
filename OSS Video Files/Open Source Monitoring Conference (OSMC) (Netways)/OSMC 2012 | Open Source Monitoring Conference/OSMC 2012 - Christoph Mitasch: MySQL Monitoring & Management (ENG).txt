Title: OSMC 2012 - Christoph Mitasch: MySQL Monitoring & Management (ENG)
Publication date: 2015-01-07
Playlist: OSMC 2012 | Open Source Monitoring Conference
Description: 
	MySQL has integrated various possibilities to analyze a server. The speech will discuss the commands SHOW, EXPLAIN, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA, and the slow/general query log. Since version 5.5 MySQL has also integrated the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.
Moreover the speech will give an overview on monitoring solutions from third-parties with a focus on free software. Kontrollbase, Jetprofiler, and phpMyAdmin offer a GUI for monitoring. The mysql-cacti-templates/percona-monitoring-plugins allow generating extensive graphs.
For general monitoring purposes Icinga plugins are well suited. This can be very important when using MySQL replication. It must be assured that the slave lag is not getting to large and the data sets on master and slave are identical (checksums). This speech has a focus on practical experiences and the speaker is interested in sharing experiences with the audience.
