Being a JavaScript developer is pretty messy. The frontend development world is in constant change and we don't even stop to analyse what we're doing any more. We build libraries to fix problems and keep using them although the problems are gone. We stifle creativity and innovation by telling people off for "doing things wrong". And we don't even consider understanding what others did before replacing it with the next new thing. Let's take a breather and stop chasing great ideas not very likely to ever be how we work. We need more people to work on interfaces. Let's concentrate on what matters.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
