Title: feTurbulence; Important!  - City JS Conf 2019

	Chris Heilmann

Being a JavaScript developer is pretty messy. The frontend development world is in constant change and we don't even stop to analyse what we're doing any more. We build libraries to fix problems and keep using them although the problems are gone. We stifle creativity and innovation by telling people off for "doing things wrong". And we don't even consider understanding what others did before replacing it with the next new thing. Let's take a breather and stop chasing great ideas not very likely to ever be how we work. We need more people to work on interfaces. Let's concentrate on what matters.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,740
I want to talk about a tooth I think

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,299
today that annoys me about what we're

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,200
doing here because I've been doing this

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,840
for a long long time

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,210
and I keep seeing the same mistakes

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,690
being made or the same arguments being

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,820
done and most importantly I think we

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,920
consider ourselves more important than

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,460
we actually are in that market where we

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,080
are I remember like 2006 - first

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,580
conferences here in London when nobody

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,380
cared about web development and all

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,210
these people that have like beards and

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,800
suspenders and work on like Java and

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,809
these kind of things were laughing at us

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,579
for using javascript and now there's a

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,460
JavaScript conference every week and

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,950
we're like really forefront of IT and I

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,260
work for Microsoft now so I get into

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,329
these discussions with like people who

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,010
work in banks and insurance companies

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,320
and I see the infrastructure that they

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,739
are using and I'm like well the stuff

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,649
that day-to-day we rely on on software

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,899
has nothing to do with what we do not in

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,780
terms of stack not in terms of quality

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,730
not in terms of maintainability we

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,500
actually build for 40 years terrible

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,960
terrible things and hope nobody realizes

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,630
it so I think it's very important for us

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,159
to consider our place in that space

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,960
because the wonderful thing about the

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,049
web and I've been doing it for 20 years

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,659
in like companies like a chalasis Yahoo

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,909
eToys Mozilla I wrote a lot of books and

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,820
a member of like to share several WC

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,710
groups as well and I just found that the

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,540
movement of the web became so fast

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,520
because everybody's invited to play with

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,520
us so I think it's very important that

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,950
we as a community stay inviting and stay

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,229
interesting and stay not opinionated

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,329
about one certain thing but when I

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,100
actually do this daily right now going

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,930
on and Twitter in the morning it's like

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,880
I get up like this and I feel happy and

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,240
then when I go on Twitter I look like

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,920
this after a short while that's also the

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,329
difference if you have to I moved from

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,799
England back to Germany so I had good

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,270
new passports and everything so that's

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,090
the difference between a photographer

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,439
and going into a photo booth especially

00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,670
when you have your dog on a lead and

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,899
people are playing with your dog outside

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,719
while you're trying to take a picture

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,310
this is how that second picture happened

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,190
but it's just annoys me that like

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,619
there's only fighting in this community

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,900
by now everybody has a great opinion and

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,620
forces other people in on other people

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,140
rather than like

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,000
the nurturing and supportive thing when

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,980
the web was not as defined as it is now

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,409
when we just had to fight the browser

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,209
and everyday on every single front we

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,489
actually were a better community because

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,440
we just did things we're like hey I did

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,409
this with CSS do you think it's working

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,150
and not like I did this with CSS I put

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,459
it in the NPM package you should use it

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,959
right now are not professional so we

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,849
actually get introduced into these

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,860
discussions that don't make any sense to

00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,690
me and this is what I call that front

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,180
end turbulence going on right now so if

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,579
this JavaScript versus CSS frameworks

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,410
versus vanilla brevity versus minute in

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,629
ten ability tooling versus low barrier

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,430
of entry client versus server native

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,069
versus web bo-buds versus desktop cats

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,609
versus dogs we have we find a reason to

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:02,519
argue for our everything and in essence

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,040
we never look at the at the environment

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,769
why somebody did something a lot of

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,090
times you could look at software or

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,890
products that people built and they're

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,720
horrible and we think it's because those

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,819
people are terrible programmers or bad

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,220
designers but most of the time it's not

00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,069
our decision that caused these kind of

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,840
things during my career I always fought

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,169
like other project managers I thought

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,489
marketing I fought like users I love it

00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,139
when you work in an agency and you make

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,239
like three designs for a client and you

00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,220
make one that is obviously so ugly that

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,690
they should choose one of the other two

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,599
and then you have then they chose that

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,359
one and you're like this was a joke you

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,129
know that like no rotating unicorns on

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,690
your insurance website and you're like

00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,949
what but it's so cool Mike's my son

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,049
loves it like you cannot win so I love

00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,459
these analyzed is a bit like the things

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,799
we say to each other without considering

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,079
context you put some code on Twitter and

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,129
there's like 12 things or I don't know

00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,769
how many it is because I haven't

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,750
prepared my slides basically does does

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:02,790
these immediate reactions that come back

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,430
friend like this does not work when the

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,500
data you put in is impure like you know

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,599
like I like three lines of JavaScript no

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,269
like yeah if this array has like things

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,310
in it there's like null value or strings

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm like I created the array that goes

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,030
into that I just wanted to write this

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,310
little piece of code I control the data

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,919
not everything has to become this thing

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,479
that any data can go into although we

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,180
always say like that's the cleanest way

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,160
of coding or this doesn't perform

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,139
have a lot of data like this this

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,490
doesn't scale to 10,000 objects in

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,800
JavaScript and I'm like where do these

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,780
10,000 objects come from why do we have

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
them instead of thus saying like this

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,560
needs to scale to infinity this should

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,389
be written much shorter is my favorite

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,860
when people like oh I know how to write

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,860
shorter code than you and I'm like I

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,750
wrote in Perl for three years I can

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,270
write unreadable that you have

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,020
no idea what's going on and that does

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,880
tend 10 things at the same time this

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,259
does not work in old browsers which is

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
always my favorite like yeah but

00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,530
Internet Explorer 6 users will not get

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,449
this and I'm like yeah and they

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,970
shouldn't they're not used to beautiful

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,770
things we confuse them with complex

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,720
interfaces just give them forms and

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,289
they're happy and they don't want to use

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,289
computers they have to this is not

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,789
accessible is a pretty problematic one

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:20,070
because I'm very much about

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,539
accessibility and I love that everything

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,099
has to be available for everybody but

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,710
just saying like oh this is not

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:27,389
accessible to people who are blind might

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,889
mean it's actually highly accessible for

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:30,930
people who are dyslexic or people who

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:32,520
are hard of hearing accessibility is not

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,650
a binary state it's basically a

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,750
grayscale I mean I've got glasses and

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,690
then I realized I get old and I now have

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,449
a very focal glasses and these kind of

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,550
things the as we go through life our

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,229
ability change and our accessibility

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,849
needs to change with it as well so

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:49,620
saying like this is not accessible

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,440
because I know this should be like that

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,180
is a terrible thing because my main

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,490
problem is these are knee-jerk reactions

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,990
these are like these quick reactions on

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,150
things that basically instead of

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,580
thinking about why people do these kind

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,770
of things so we create these

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,659
indefensible accusations by zooming out

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,060
a disregarding circumstances so we

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:10,949
basically say like oh this is not this

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,880
doesn't scale to lots of data and we

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,560
never even question if it needs to or

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,690
what this thing is gonna be used at so

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,699
we're always doing that way and a great

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,110
thing is because we do it because we

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,520
look clever and we look like we're

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,099
caring more about the web than the

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,979
person that put his coat or her coat out

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,770
there for the world to see like this is

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,889
just amazing how we criticize somebody

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,020
for sharing instead of just like oh this

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,400
is good but maybe they're loaded if you

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,300
want to scale it to infinity that would

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,710
be a thing to do and not like you should

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,590
make this work or it's not the right

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,750
kind of code because is it worth

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,180
discouraging people that way I mean as

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,430
somebody who just wants to learn and I

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,050
go out on Twitter and I see people that

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,360
I look up to arguing with each other

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,370
like three-year-olds it's not a fun

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,259
experience and I probably don't want to

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,900
be part of this community then so

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,340
shaming people publicly and blaming them

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,080
for things that are not necessarily a

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,060
problem I don't think it's worth it

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,830
because we want this community to keep

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,800
growing and to keep being relevant as

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,810
well so it's the right place and time to

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,780
argue for quality when the product is

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,629
done and I think not at all because the

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,610
final product is not what we wrote as

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:23,500
code at the beginning we always have

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,530
great intentions we write wonderful

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,919
clean things and then things happen like

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,960
people happen and input happens and and

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,490
changes happen and we're just like the

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,289
more and more is like millions of cuts

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,659
how the product ends up life what we

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:39,039
don't want to be every probably everyone

00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,620
here in the room who's a developer hurt

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,479
that lie that like oh let's do it

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,449
quickly and then later on you get time

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,729
to fix it this is never the case

00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:51,610
this never happens it's just a lie don't

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,259
don't try to get encouraged by that my

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,270
favorite thing about when it comes to

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,210
the CSS versus JavaScript is that a

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,130
exclamation mark important because it's

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,460
just this wonderful confusing moment as

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,349
a CSS person important means this is so

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,060
important it should not be able to

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,129
overwrite and it's actually something

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,190
that is kind of an anti-pattern because

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,990
it becomes not over writable by

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,569
something else so it basically is too

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,029
strict to be encode that if somebody

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,949
else needs to use of course there's bugs

00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,199
like an Internet Explorer seven and

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,940
eight if you use 64 classes and one

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,150
element it overrides important but you

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,039
shouldn't rely on that either and as its

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,349
CSS developer if I see this in

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:36,130
production I know some JavaScript person

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,019
has written CSS as a JavaScript person I

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,820
see this and I'm like that's the way how

00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,860
I make CSS work because it doesn't show

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,110
up unless I put 12 of those in there or

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,029
like use five IDs on an element not

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,579
realizing that an ID should be a unique

00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,980
identifier per document and as the

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,690
JavaScript or Java or a c-sharp person

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,110
who never seen CSS this means not

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,670
important

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,899
you know it's sex no wonder we're not

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,850
talking to each other in these

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,709
communities when things like that happen

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,360
maybe we should do a question mark

00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,940
important maybe it is maybe you don't

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,320
you know like some api's are like that

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,720
are my favorite API when it comes to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,579
html5 is T can play through sing for the

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,079
video element that there's a video

00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,060
element you can say I can play through

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,060
and you give it the the mime type of the

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:23,560
video and it has three return values

00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,810
probably maybe an empty strings I still

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,579
don't know why this API exists cuz if I

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,620
want like vague answers I talk to people

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,560
not to API is like can you play that

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,600
through maybe like what was the use of

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,899
that control of that API call kind of

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,870
thing

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:40,240
okay things that should matter in a web

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,040
product if we think about it are several

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,870
of them its accessibility its

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,730
interoperability like make it available

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,290
for everybody make it available for

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,019
every device because we cannot control

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,360
what our end users use to go on the web

00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,750
and believe me I wish we could but we

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,670
can't

00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,500
it's just not oh not our place to do it

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,290
performance make the thing work well

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,000
where if you're offline or if you got

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,310
slow connectivity then it's a very

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,730
important thing and security cuz people

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,380
are stupid its security is depressing

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,360
like you do so many wonderful things and

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,519
then people use password 1 2 3 is their

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,230
password or they they share their

00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,420
two-factor authentication with another

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,639
phone that is actually not secured and

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,199
it's just terrible I love when you have

00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,029
computers and people like can you fix

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,250
this thing if you ever need to fix a Mac

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,860
for somebody and it's not an encrypted

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,660
hard drive just to Apple s when you

00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,250
start the thing because you get into a

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,510
terminal and you can access the whole

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,579
machine this is something that they

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,420
built for the geniuses and in the shop

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:39,100
to actually fix Mac so that's wonderful

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,870
now we have a grits a great stacked oh

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,480
we've got HTML which is basically

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,180
marking up and the foundation of any web

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,889
product out there HTML by using things

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,720
like button elements you get like

00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,639
accessibility to a degree for free

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,800
because it's keyboard accessible it's

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,230
focusable it actually has two states

00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,790
built-in as well the DD press state the

00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,589
depress state which are always like like

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,170
did you depress that button yeah I told

00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,329
him it's ugly it's not a right thing to

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,430
do but people use dips and then puts

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,940
bands on even simulate HTML so if you

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,680
actually look

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,780
HTML what it can do for you there's a

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,710
lot of opportunities there and the great

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,870
thing is when it comes to

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,180
responsibilities the browser is

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,100
basically taking most the responsibility

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,500
to standard as well and you have a bit

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,380
of responsibility to use the right HTML

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,240
element to to find out what's there

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,790
there like you yeah a link should be

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,290
something pointing to something a button

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,270
can be something accessing some

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,920
JavaScript functionality a link should

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,450
not cause JavaScript functionality

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,040
because then it breaks but JavaScript

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,610
doesn't work which can happen all the

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,110
time with CSS we always talked about CSS

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,790
especially as I go you can make it

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,310
pretty and you can put colors in there

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,320
but by now CSS has become a proper

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,840
layout engine and a proper animation

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,060
engine and the proper rendering control

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,360
as well with Houdini you can even write

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,890
JavaScript to rub to create CSS

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,230
functionality so it's not that black box

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,570
anymore you just have to try or trust

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,390
you actually understand how CSS renders

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,950
things so the responsibilities there are

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,690
kind of similar as well the standard has

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,180
a bit more responsibilities because CSS

00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,250
changed a lot over the last few years

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,260
where it's like HTML state the same

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,110
since html5 more or less because it's

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,220
harder to change those things and

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,510
JavaScript of course is magic and we

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,580
could do whatever we want with

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,410
JavaScript because you can generate CSS

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,180
in JavaScript you can generate HTML and

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,560
JavaScript you could generate music you

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,690
can generate codecs you can generate

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,800
everything in JavaScript right now but

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,810
that of course means that you

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,860
responsibly responsible for everything a

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,450
CSS animation the browser jumps jumps

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,590
through hoops and depends over backwards

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,330
to make sure that you see us as

00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,980
animations work your JavaScript

00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,310
animation when a slow machine might

00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,630
actually not end so it's your job to

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,640
monitor your frames per second if they

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,110
become too slow and the animation and

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,820
jump to the end state so you don't have

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,610
any interfaces that are stuck halfway

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,230
through so a lot of what CSS does for

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,350
you you can do in JavaScript as well but

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,600
it's your responsibility and I'm lazy I

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,890
don't want that responsibility

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,480
especially not an environment where I

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,400
can't control it where I don't know what

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,500
people use as their end products or

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,570
asked even their their platforms that

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,490
they run my code on but still it's very

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,710
tempting as a developer and as somebody

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,260
who feels very clever to want to do

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,300
everything on my own so to me the

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,560
argument JavaScript versus CSS is

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,790
basically more or less like

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,199
do I want to give the control to the

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,410
browser or do I want to control

00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,600
everything myself and as I see how many

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,459
products I worked on and how much I had

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,800
a chance to revisit these products later

00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:34,959
on maybe giving some control away to the

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,610
platform is not the worst idea because

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,790
you're not gonna have time to fix that

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,589
code later on we're well prepared to

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,449
create magic like with JavaScript

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:45,249
nowadays and with the browsers that we

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:47,499
have and the environments we have right

00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,749
now we can create amazing web products

00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:52,149
that are basically very much in on par

00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:54,220
with native applications in Microsoft

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:55,899
we're now more or less giving up on fad

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,670
client applications everything is gonna

00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,050
be web applications and progressive web

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,579
apps so next week we're gonna have our

00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,290
conference what we're gonna announce a

00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,749
lot of things with partners that are

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,699
pwace rather than like oh install this

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:09,399
and it updates every two days without

00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:11,529
you wanting to so we have developer

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,689
tools in browsers and they give us so

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:15,759
much inside they give us like that the

00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:18,129
the network stack how much memory was

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,230
used the performance of the thing the

00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:23,170
security we can audit it in the browser

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,629
itself so we have full insight into our

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,670
products and how they behave and to me

00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:29,470
who started a long time ago this is a

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,629
dream come true we just had alert and

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,220
basically hope that we get some

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:34,720
information out of it we just add zeros

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,259
and ones and sometimes we use two letter

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,059
O because the zero key was broken we

00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:42,550
have development environments that are

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:44,319
open source written in typescript like

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,449
Visual Studio code that while we're

00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:48,220
coding gives us explanations what the

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:49,930
thing is rather than having to go to a

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,930
browser tab and look it up and

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:56,290
understand it so we have this in context

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,879
help to know what we're doing and it

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,189
should be it should be something that we

00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,540
embrace much earlier on like it's always

00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,519
very exciting when we talk to people

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,439
about the web Anila or you use a text

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,750
editor you can use text pad or whatever

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,579
to start your first website but this one

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,269
gets you so much further

00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:15,699
I love the integration of of get in in

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:17,439
developer tools in editors now you say

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:19,059
so I don't have to explain it to people

00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:21,069
I'm like okay you did a change there's

00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,689
this M next to it if you click on that

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:24,249
one and you describe what you've done

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,529
you send it off other people can use

00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:28,509
your code afterwards not like go to the

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:31,870
terminal do these cryptic git commands

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,610
and do like - C - C and then quotations

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,180
and whatever it's like just do it in the

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,160
editor

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,660
self it's a wonderful thing we have we

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,390
have get up of course as a way to

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,130
collaborate and as a way to to send our

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,410
code out to other people if we could hit

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,960
by up by a bus your code lives on by

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,420
having it out there and when I look at

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,160
github and for people to hire I don't

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,680
look necessarily at your code of course

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,330
I do but I also look at how you create

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,399
how you deal with other people how do

00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,350
you deal with Forks how you deal with

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,020
full requests how you deal with comments

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,700
and thatwe are also I already know what

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,310
you're gonna be as a team player in your

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,610
company as well so what you do on github

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,740
is very very important as a as a as a

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,839
job for the future as well because this

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,730
is a place to shine this is a place to

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,950
be nice to each other and to actually

00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,630
show how companies how collaborative

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,459
coding should work as well

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,930
I still have wished I had been at the

00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,510
first pitch of github when they go to

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,020
some VC and say like oh we do a social

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,970
network for developers you know like you

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,100
mean social interaction and developers

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,490
as a product and they're like yeah okay

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,410
good luck with that so we're kind of

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,240
empowered nowadays to write great things

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,250
we've got highly optimized code we got

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,110
reusable clean components we got modular

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,670
design systems flexible api's these

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,350
things are the things I'm not gonna all

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,750
of them to out to you these are things

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,970
we can write with this toolset that we

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,250
have of evergreen browsers really good

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,130
editors version controlling that is

00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,470
understandable not like CVS or mercurial

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,779
other things we did before social

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,510
interaction is built into what we do so

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,120
we should build really great things but

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:10,030
if we look past our world of conferences

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,589
magazines and podcasts it kind of looks

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,780
different when you talk to the people

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,220
who go to the office at nine o'clock and

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,319
leave the office at five o'clock and do

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,790
some code in between these are different

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,679
people from us they don't spend

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,980
therefore their free time looking at

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,510
things and then you realize that it's

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,490
not that important for people to

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,020
actually care about the accessibility to

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,870
interoperability to performance and the

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,429
security not because they're not caring

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,350
about it but because they're not paid to

00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:37,420
do it they're not interested they're not

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,830
supported by their company to think

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,900
about these things they're just there to

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,809
churn out code as quickly as possible

00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,340
and you see it in the results I know if

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,110
you seen this body at the web main

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,970
project they did it like the four

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,950
biggest million web sites out there and

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,170
analyzed the security issues in them and

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,180
they had like low contrast and missing

00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,190
alternative text in almost every single

00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,190
website and these are such simple things

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,990
to do right and they're so painful for

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,230
people who cannot see or cannot see

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,660
properly to be in unable to use your

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,280
product and the other one is of course

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,720
that the products are full of cruft when

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,260
you look at the page weight percentiles

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,040
of HTTP archive you've got 90 percent of

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,590
websites have 5.8 mac of data random

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,840
stuff downloaded to your machine I just

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,420
been in Jordan where with my German SIM

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,070
card 10 kilobyte of data I don't know

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,110
anybody who does kilobyte except for

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,260
German mobile phone providers cost me

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,850
like 12 cent so a 5.8 Mac website is

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,679
basically the same as a ticket to end

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,809
game or some other cinema and I hope

00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,429
your website is as interesting because

00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,780
this is gonna be really really bad for

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,820
you I was shocking I was shocked getting

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,309
home I had just had my my roaming on for

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,230
two days 90 euros for two days just for

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:49,940
doing some random surfing out there and

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,640
this is bad we should be embarrassed

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,280
about this but the problem is we're not

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
necessarily the people who cost it

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,860
because when we think about the web

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,870
products back we always think like this

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,940
is our world with like HTML CSS and

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,590
JavaScript we're like this is what you

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,080
do everything in it but when you look at

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,570
what cost a product on the web there's

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,340
much more in there so there's the

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,570
backend as the content management system

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,920
and the framework that people have been

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,390
using it messes with your code

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,040
there's the servers and the cloud

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,320
platform that might not allow a certain

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,660
version of your code to run does the dev

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,490
ops people IT legal sales shareholders

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,260
and investors all these people have a

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,450
say in the products that we build and

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,670
most of time they undo a lot of good

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,440
that we as developers put in there but

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,730
we're arrogant enough to only talk to

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,860
each other and think like we could never

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,780
reach these people and I think it's it's

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,030
kind of unfair that our wonderful work

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,610
is being torpedoed by other people in

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,230
the company not because of malice but

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,970
because they just don't know that what

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,980
they're using might be interfering with

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,050
the good intentions that we had so our

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,240
job should be to be much more visible to

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:53,390
these other parts of the company as well

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,280
and integrate it into decision making so

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,810
we're competing without knowing it does

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,890
staying in budget is a very important

00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,930
thing for every web product

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,940
first-to-market is another big thing

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,560
like okay I know it's great a lot of

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,300
accessibility but we gotta be the first

00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,830
ones to roll it out so we have to think

00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,170
about accessibility later which is a

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,270
no-go there's just no way to think about

00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,560
accessibility later and there's

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,120
continuous growth that's the other

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,700
problem a lot of our products that we

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,410
build are actually either already listed

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,900
on the on the stock market or we have

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,580
some VC company to make happy so they

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,230
want to see continuous change they don't

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,970
want to see quality they want to see new

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,860
features all the time no matter if

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,960
end-users really ask for those things it

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,380
just needs to be a differentiator from

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,870
your competition so to stay in budget

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,040
reckless reuse is one thing that we

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,390
basically do and this is where

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,030
frameworks and these things are very

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,620
much cool for companies to do I like

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,600
Dylan be teased post the other day when

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,350
you said like just creating a react app

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:51,470
and an MT react app is like 1.5 million

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,390
lines of code contributed by people in

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,580
their free time no process to actually

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,350
the quality of it and I don't think that

00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,720
is criticism of him to say like this is

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,640
how broken it is it's just the way we've

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,530
become we just trust these things

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,150
because we don't have time or our

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,860
companies don't give us enough time to

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,170
actually think about what we're doing

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,520
not just everybody else uses react if it

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,140
scales for Facebook it's gonna be

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,820
probably good for that three-page

00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,610
marketing website that you're building

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,380
to and no it's not you don't want to

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,630
have these five mega javascript in there

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,060
but if you look at the the web in

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,670
general its assembled 27 percent of

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,580
sites are 90 to 99 percent third-party

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,410
content nobody writes code from scratch

00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,240
anymore and everything we talk about

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,190
these events is like when you start from

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,690
scratch you can create clean code from

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,850
this and then you're like yeah but you

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,200
already have a lot of stuff to deal with

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,860
that you have to change and put your

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,750
code inside it and we we have a lot of

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,900
like legacy code that is still out there

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,790
and will not it refuses to die so first

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,260
to market is really bad for quality

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,680
because you have to get it out there so

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,590
first most of time we build an MVP a

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,780
Minimum Viable Product product and it

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,030
always drives me nuts because like okay

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,560
let's it's we know it's terrible but put

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,750
it out there because we want to be first

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,250
to do it so most of the MVPs are

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,970
basically bits of string and chewing gum

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,260
some spit and duct tape

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,490
and then we put it out there and say

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,320
like look we got a product with the

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,179
first to market which would not be a

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,640
problem if we kill those things you know

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,020
if we build an MVP we delete it we do

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,120
another MVP we delete it

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,909
we did another one we delete it but we

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,950
don't in the flash world we did this

00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,600
back then basically nobody cared if your

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,280
game that was successful for the last

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,140
three weeks will be played in seven

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,480
years time it's just like yeah I write

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,690
the next game fine but on the web we

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,429
actually keep putting MVPs out there and

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,049
then we put something extra there to

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,340
make them grow and make them work that

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,990
what I said earlier like you're gonna

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,289
get time later to fix it which you never

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,480
get how does this continuous growth

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,700
happen and it's mostly stickiness and

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,380
analytics instead of like building

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,539
something that people love we put like

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,190
libraries they're seeing how many people

00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,140
are using it and when people don't use

00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,330
it we give them like how about a pop-up

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,580
window to ask for notifications how

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,169
about we give you like a pop-up window

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,460
to sign up for a newsletter for the

00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:08,220
article that you haven't even written

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,840
yet or haven't even read yet so that's

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,039
why we have reader modes in browsers and

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,809
stuff because we put all this stuff

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,530
internal people cause we hope they love

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,700
it then and again this is another

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,590
analysis and I'm putting all these links

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,270
out later on as well well we realized

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,090
that most of the cruft of the web is

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,710
third-party stuff it's not our code it's

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,720
things that somebody else the company

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,880
puts on top of our code to make it a

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,799
sticky product and yeah it's sticky in

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,870
the sense of sticky things that you

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,059
shouldn't touch but it's basically that

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,220
so we build an MVP and then we actually

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,590
put the analytics on there so we know

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,210
who actually uses our stuff and then we

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,490
put marketing features on there like

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,710
notifications and newsletter features

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,120
and then we put it we realize it's

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,250
actually getting slow so we put it on a

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,280
beefier cloud system we put AWS Essure

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,990
or whatever and then we actually have an

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,190
enterprise rollout our product becomes

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,870
successful and out of a sudden people

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,360
have to think about people who don't

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,130
speak English and actually have maybe a

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,860
right-to-left rendering and these kind

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,750
of things so out of a sudden this MVP

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,480
that should have died a long time ago is

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,460
this just like Frankenstein monster of

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,020
code that we need to make work somehow

00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,760
so what happens at the end of this

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,289
process is that every company goes into

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,360
panic and what you do when you when you

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,039
do panic you basically you hire some

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,720
consultants to help us with the

00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,860
accessibility the interoperability the

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,890
performance and the secure

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,210
of the thing and it's it's frustrating

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,890
but I loved working as a consultant

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,549
because you tell people things that are

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,799
already broken

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:33,330
you know these problems they just don't

00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,740
want to talk to each other about it or

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,010
be the one that tells their company that

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,860
it's broken so they pay you for the for

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,320
the insight that they already have which

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,940
is cool but it's sadly enough how our

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,710
market works at the moment because when

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,110
it costs money to pay somebody for it

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:52,130
it's more important other than talking

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,720
to your own engineers and trusting them

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,400
so the web as a platform is kind of ripe

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,230
for abuse and that's basically the

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,610
beauty of the web but also the problem

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,929
of the web the web is define is

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,540
forgiving developer error

00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:05,400
yeah that's why XHTML neverkey became a

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,320
thing because one little rendering thing

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,030
and people wouldn't have a website we've

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,830
been one of the tenants of the web is

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,350
like we protect the end-user from

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,990
stupidity of the developer and that's

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,730
browsers have to do that forever we

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,770
can't break the web when we released

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,929
edge as a brand-new browser with the

00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,549
edge HTML engine we're like look this is

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,200
how everything standards-compliant and

00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,630
then no website worked because people

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,360
relied on Safari specialized code on

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,280
things only in Chrome on things only in

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,600
Internet Explorer at one time we

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,450
actually put a lot of stuff on the web

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,250
that is not standard per standards

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,660
compliant so every browser needs to copy

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,760
the code from other browsers and the

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,280
mistakes from other browsers just to not

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,230
break the web and pass browser

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,360
competition as also non reliable

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,040
standard ap is that life products rely

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,290
on I still have to deal with people that

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,960
deal with Silverlight or flash

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,940
components or things that basically like

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,669
that's how a browser made it different

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,160
to others like Internet Explorer 5 for

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,600
knowing X power 502 had colored scroll

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,450
bars and people like oh we rely on that

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,820
one you're like oh god really so that

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,610
adds a lot of cruft and security attack

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,190
vectors cause code that has been used in

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,559
1999 like vml for example in Internet

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,760
Explorer 6 is now a security attack

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,490
vector because that code hasn't been

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,380
touched so as when something gets older

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,510
it gets more vulnerable to attacks so

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,520
basically as we can't remove it the bad

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,710
people of the web are gonna gonna abuse

00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,390
it and we can't stop developers from

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,100
being sloppy we cannot just tell like

00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,110
this is how you should do the web some

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,779
companies try but people are just not

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,639
wired that way

00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,960
so we have patches and solutions for

00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,639
these kind of things and this is where

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,549
it gets really embarrassing for us as

00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:46,129
developers that a thing like amp exists

00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,559
just because we most developers didn't

00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:50,899
build fast websites is kind of sad that

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,309
Safari is limiting javascript and says

00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:53,779
like only that much javascript is

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,999
allowed before we actually cut it off

00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,489
because you're overusing JavaScript is

00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:01,309
basically Safari protecting its end

00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:03,529
users from our bundling things Chrome's

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:05,330
never slow mode as well and all kind of

00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,409
blockers people always seem so excited

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,239
when they have blockers in their

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,979
browsers and you like what you do with

00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:12,139
that it's just to make advertising more

00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:14,659
aggressive it's an arms race that none

00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:17,659
of us can win so we should actually find

00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,529
a way to make the web be a be a thing

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:20,599
where you can make money without

00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:22,909
plastering everything with trackers and

00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:24,649
advertising instead so there's a few

00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:26,989
ideas there but nothing that is viable

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,759
at the moment so this is all kind of

00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:31,099
depressing for me as a developer like

00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:32,929
I'm seeing that that the VAP is in that

00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,669
state and at the same time we've got all

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:37,369
this beautiful technology and beautiful

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:39,229
build processes and to change to work

00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:41,089
with so there's where's that disconnect

00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:43,279
what can we do about it so what can we

00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:45,259
do as developers to work around that

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,609
issue and I hope I'm not depressing you

00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:48,049
too much but I think it's very important

00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:49,789
ever realized we're part of much bigger

00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,649
world and we think we are we're not that

00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:54,679
much in control of our destiny in this

00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:55,999
case I love this CSS tricks article make

00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:58,580
it hard to screw up driven development

00:27:55,999 --> 00:28:01,190
and that's exactly what I'm doing right

00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,379
now like by teaching people the web

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,080
starting with visual studio code and

00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:07,820
with github I already teach them to say

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,309
like here's an editor that can help you

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,049
not screw up and here is actually a way

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:15,080
how your code can be looked at by other

00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,729
people and and worked with other people

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,710
without you actually being their sole

00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:20,899
person that has to maintain it for the

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,849
rest of your life we've got browser tool

00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,649
audits in developer tools we've got

00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:26,659
auditing reports that give us all kind

00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:28,399
of insights and these are things to show

00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:30,859
to your managers to show the people like

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,080
I didn't do this 90 percent speed

00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:35,210
problem there where is this 90 percent

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,889
speed problem if you see you any of the

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,419
talks by Harry Roberts he's like that's

00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,129
what he does with clients they pay him

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:42,799
for doing the most obvious things of

00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:44,899
saying like you've got 15 third-party

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,649
libraries doing tracking in there what

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,450
do they do

00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:49,009
and most clients can't even answer what

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,550
these things do they just be doing them

00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:51,050
for like

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,140
the beginning of time and keep reusing

00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,480
them in every product if you don't like

00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,429
what lighthouse or developer tools do

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,929
this whipping IO weapon I always

00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,340
basically doing the same thing but you

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:04,490
can configure it to your needs so you

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,720
can turn off all the things if you if PW

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,100
a checking is not something that's

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,170
applicable to your product cause it's an

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,660
internet page you can turn that off if

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,190
you need if you need a quality control

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,679
that your company logo is in every

00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,380
footer of the page you can write a hint

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,120
which is a JSON object basically to test

00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,950
this and you can make it part of your

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,140
continuous integration you can make it

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,059
part of saving your content so it's an

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,260
NPM module rather than part of a

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,630
developer tools so you can use it

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,700
completely independent of the browser

00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,640
and independent of third-party resources

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:37,220
as well it's also an extension to fire

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,740
to to code so if you now write an HTML

00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,710
document it tells you the HTML element

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,270
needs a language attribute or the must

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,770
needs a language attribute because

00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,360
otherwise a screen reader will try to

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:49,670
read it with a German voice and it's

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,350
English and it's not fun or it needs a

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,500
character set to have the proper

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,420
encoding utf-8 without the dash has been

00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,370
used of like 90% of websites out there

00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,260
and if browsers wouldn't allow the

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,240
misspelling and the other thing we

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,679
basically wouldn't have a web but I love

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,360
that when you type an image in there it

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,880
says like it needs an alternative text

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,650
otherwise it's not an image so while

00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,480
you're writing your code you already get

00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,040
reminded of best practices rather than

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,050
somebody on Twitter telling you you

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,580
should have made it accessible it's much

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,929
more interesting to get it while you're

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,910
coding rather than learning about

00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:22,490
debugging it rather than learning about

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,350
coding so all these things are built for

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,179
us so browsers are have feedback

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,950
channels developer tools of feedback

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:29,900
channels all of these things are open

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,330
source available to us so we need your

00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,670
input to make these things important and

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,620
good for you what can we do better that

00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,140
you can write great code without having

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,679
to actually do jump through different

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,880
conditions and I think we should stop

00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,460
arguing amongst ourselves which

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,650
technology is better cuz yeah CSS

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,540
dustings javascript us things angular

00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,250
does things futures things you never

00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,620
know the context of the whole product

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,179
why a certain framework was chosen and

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,950
it's always clever to say like you could

00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,510
do this without it without and you can I

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,919
can do it better it on my own and you're

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,410
like yeah but we had to roll it out

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:05,330
within a month

00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,400
so contribute to products people use

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,080
content management systems build tools

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,550
and frameworks I think it's much more

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,590
important than telling people off that

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,260
their JavaScript on Twitter is not

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,760
scaling to infinity because as I said a

00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,610
lot of these things go on the web and

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,680
never get changed so our best practice

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,960
our quality syncing should go into these

00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,450
reused components rather than like our

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,760
own thing telling but if I had my way I

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,370
would be so much better and people use

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,050
this the web is being is not a thing

00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,540
anymore where we start things from

00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,160
scratch I should be I think we should

00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,230
understand why people do things before

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,030
telling them off that's a that's maybe a

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,950
good thing I do this like 30-second

00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,480
thing where I'm like I'm pissed off with

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,460
somebody and then I think about for 30

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,290
seconds and then probably most of time

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,210
I'm not pissed off anymore or I'm like

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,070
oh maybe I want to ask why that person

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,270
has done it that way rather than like oh

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,620
it's wrong you should be do be you

00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,110
should be feeling bad for doing it wrong

00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,580
and I think we should earn our seat at

00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,620
the table we're stupid decisions are

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,390
being made I'm now a principle developer

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,010
so I'm sitting in meetings with like

00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,350
product owners and these kind of things

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,210
and often I can say like we could do

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,040
this but the developers would be really

00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,040
unhappy if they had to use this product

00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,590
what can we do instead and your career

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,060
is changing over time so you will not be

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,770
the coder in the corner that does magic

00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,780
all the time you want to be the person

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,230
that can go home from time to time and

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:27,230
have a real life so the web is plumbing

00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,370
it's not the new hotness it's like kids

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,650
these days don't even know what being

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,210
offline means people don't want to

00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,100
understand how a browser works they

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,780
don't want to understand what HTTP means

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,250
they're just oh this is online this is

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,200
where I can watch Netflix this is also

00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,540
where I can upload images well soon not

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,640
anymore in Europe but this is where I

00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,000
can actually get my stuff babe it's just

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,260
seen we turn on the tap with water comes

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,580
out we don't want to know about the

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,010
plumbing we don't care about the

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,290
plumbing we go online we are online we

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,510
use a browser it's just a way of life

00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,490
it's part of our lives nowadays we only

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,560
get to get interested in it when it

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,450
doesn't work much like plumbing and as

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,950
plumbers we deal with beautiful clear

00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,350
water and we also have to deal with

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,550
other things and over my career I'm kind

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:11,510
of tired having to deal with the other

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:13,370
things instead of clear glass water so I

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,370
think the next generation is already

00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,140
doing amazing things this was a ten year

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,780
kid that used angular intensive flow to

00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,000
do a machine learning driven app at some

00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,910
event and I should be scared about this

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,860
but I'm actually power to you the

00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,870
reusable components like using tensor

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,930
flow using angular that we all have

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,910
great ideas about what they are if he

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,590
gets to build something amazing with

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,870
that and he's super excited about it

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,330
that person can then in the next step

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,010
learn why it's working but getting that

00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,870
first foot in the door and getting

00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,670
somebody in power that way is something

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,050
that I would love to think about more

00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:49,630
rather than telling each other off that

00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:53,710
our code is not clean enough and that's

00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:57,130
all I had so thank you very much

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,130
