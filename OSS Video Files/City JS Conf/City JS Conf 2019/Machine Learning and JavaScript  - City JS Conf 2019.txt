JavaScript probably isn't the first language which springs to mind when you say 'machine learning', but that does seem to be changing, especially with the release of TensorFlow.js last year.
 
This talk gives a high level overview of what machine learning and neural networks are, shows how to get started with TensorFlow.js, and demos a number of projects which use JavaScript and AI.
