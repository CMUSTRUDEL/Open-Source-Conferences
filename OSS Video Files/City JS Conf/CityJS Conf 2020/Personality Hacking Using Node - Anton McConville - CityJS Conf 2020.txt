Title: Personality Hacking Using Node - Anton McConville - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	"In this inspiring and fascinating talk, we use AI and NLP to analyse the big five personality traits of a song writer over the span of their career. We use digital drawings and data visualisations to create a well designed interactive web application that helps us explore the personality data, and compare the stages of an artistâ€™s work.

We explore the use of the emerging CSS Paint API Spec ( based on JavaScript Canvas APIs ) . We look at how to build with it, and consider the exciting future for web applications as CSS Paint becomes a standard. We review tips and approaches for using the specification.

Finally we integrate analysis for the Web Audio JavaScript API, and consider the potential for creating rich multimedia experiences with CSS Houdini and Web Audio.

The session steps through the open source code, analyses the outcomes, and considers real world applications for the concepts."

my name is anton mcconvall today i'm

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,960
presenting personality hacking with

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,559
natural language processing

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,640
and css houdini i live and work

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,079
in ottawa in canada i work for ibm

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,960
spent many of the last few years

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
building cloud-based examples mostly

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,680
mobile

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,640
to showcase ibm technology

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
whether it be through sort of the watson

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,920
artificial intelligence and natural

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,360
language processing

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,320
suite to more recently working with

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,480
openshift and

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,519
creating um cloud native applications

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,479
with service meshing with

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
serverless computing things like that i

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,200
have a background in design

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,600
and development um this

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,799
presentation and this these projects are

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,840
all passion projects they're all sort of

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,080
um almost like hobbies but

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,560
um they're sort of projects to dig into

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
new emerging technologies so for example

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,119
houdini

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
web components web audio and also to

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
stretch

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,880
design ideas and have some fun create

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
creatively and you know really

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,479
most of all to sort of learn a little

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
bit more about songwriting and

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
the the lyricists and the changes in

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
their personality over time

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
the presentation has three parts so i'm

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
going to go through

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,719
the background of the natural language

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
technology that i'm using

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,880
to sort of mine the insights and spend a

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,119
bit of time looking at css houdini

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,119
um in the second part and when we really

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
gonna skim the surface of web audio and

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,599
sort of just get a demo of that

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,000
all of my code is open source and i'll

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,560
share the repos at the end

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,440
there's a lot of different pieces of

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
technology

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
involved in this presentation so i just

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
sort of

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,160
want to get the most out of the lyrics

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,360
and houdini this time round

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
um so let's sort of just look quickly at

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,040
the theory

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
so this is a product called personality

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
insights from

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
ibm part of the watson suite i'm just

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,800
going to show you how it works

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,080
um you can take any body of text um

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,480
so in this case here's a

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
2012 debate from barack obama all the

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
text is in here

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,000
and you know as he's been speaking it

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
during the debate i'll push the analyze

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,519
button

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,040
and then this demo it's playing those

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,159
words through the watson

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,159
personality insights api and then the

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
output looks like this so there's just

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,680
over 7000 wires analyzed at like 6000 to

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,239
get some kind of confidence

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,319
um and it creates a summary it creates

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
you know consumer needs values

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,159
the thing that i'm interested in is this

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
personality part

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
and it is broken into five different

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
areas called the big five personality

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
traits

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,159
it's a really good wikipedia page that

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
sort of goes through the background of

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,959
this

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
i'm gonna sort of dig into it a little

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,120
bit more in a second or two as well

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,239
um but if we pop back here you'll see

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,280
it's scoring president obama's

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,360
um debate speech on each of these things

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
over this conscientiousness introversion

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,159
extraversion agreeableness and emotional

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
range

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
and it's putting them on a percentile in

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
addition it gives

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
subtracts for each of those five things

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
um

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
and scores them on a percentile basis as

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
well

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,080
so you can see the sort of api that i'm

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
using

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,640
um you can experiment with this for free

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,439
you get a certain amount of calls for

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,599
free

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,040
it's fun to do with your own work if you

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
have a blog post or if you've written

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,799
something substantial

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
it's fun to sort of have a bit of an

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,320
insight into your own stuff

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,759
so that's the sort of background and the

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
api that

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,440
i'm using these are the big five

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
personality traits so

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
openness is an appreciation for art and

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
emotion

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,400
conscientiousness is a sort of

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,479
measurement of organization

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
self-discipline extraversion versus

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
introversion is how you're projecting

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
your energy

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
and your moods and your sociability

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,000
agreeableness

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
is your tendency to work well with

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,759
others the level of cooperation

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
compassion for others and the emotional

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
range so in the watson world

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
um it's called emotional range and the

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
big five personality traits is called

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
neuroticism

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,199
and it's a degree of emotional stability

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
and impulse control

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,919
and so how am i getting these things so

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
what i'm doing is i'm taking

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,400
an artist looking at you know their body

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,280
of work their albums so

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,039
in this case we're looking at coldplay

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,560
this is chris martin and the viva la

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,639
vida era

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
taking a viva la vida album all the

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
songs on there so

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,520
viva la vida for example is one of the

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
songs on there

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
and that collection of songs playing

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,680
those

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,440
through the watson personality insights

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
so the lyrics from those songs

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,520
you know collecting them together for

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,520
that album putting that through the api

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
for the personality insights and then

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,759
it's given me that report of the big

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
five personality traits for that album

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
and i'm doing that for sort of all of

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,080
the albums

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,919
um for coldplay or for whatever artist

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,000
i'm looking at and i've looked at

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,600
bowie i've been looking at the beatles i

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
looked at the hamilton musical

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
i'm going to sort of hop around some of

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
those projects a little later too um

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,720
this is a photograph from

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
coldplay and concert that i took it was

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
really moving

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
and i loved the confetti it was you know

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
lots of light

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,080
from fireworks and balloons and these

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
cool watches that we had in our arms

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,199
that lit up

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
in sync with the songs this is very

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,280
moving and colorful

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,880
and uh i wanted to see if i could

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,319
visualize this with some form of

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,360
confetti which is where

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,479
the seed sort of got planted to use

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,120
houdini and

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
like i was saying you know co-playing

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
out of eight

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,240
albums so going from 2000

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,080
to 2019 um the most recent one was

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
everyday life just sort of late last

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,120
year

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,800
so what i do is i sketch the artists

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
you know as well and i sort of work with

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
the color palette to try and build a

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
design idea

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,840
around how i want to present the data

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,120
for each of them so

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,160
just sort of look at um this is my

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,080
illustrator the

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
you know adobe illustrator files these

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,560
are the the bowie

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,479
um images that i drew

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
um these are the ones here for co-play

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,080
that you've just seen um they all sort

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,680
of start with like a

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,039
very weird sort of blob

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,840
um sort of body that i just sort of

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,919
dress

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,599
to you know i research and dress i've

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,000
done one for the the beatles

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,360
more recently as well i used color

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,599
palettes from pantone

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,599
um to match and and sort of

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,080
tie into like how they were dressing at

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,520
the time to get some consistency going

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,960
for those um and so you know i can

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,520
sort of go through how that project

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,400
turned out for coldplay and this is

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,360
um this is what it sort of looks like

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,759
so here what i've done is i've made you

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,800
know

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,360
the chris martin um era

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
figure b front and center and you can

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
see

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,560
i've animated the changing of the

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,319
measurements of the percentiles for each

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,240
of the big five personality traits for

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
each of those albums

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,440
over time and i've sort of done it

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,759
deliberately like this side and mind

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,879
to you know immerse that chris

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,560
martin drawing alongside these big bar

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
charts because i want to turn them into

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
confetti so that he's surrounded by

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
confetti at some point now

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
you know we'll look at how i did that or

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
how well i did that

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
um but it's neat to sort of look through

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,800
this cycle of animation because

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
you can see album by album that you know

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
things are changing

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,440
the lyrics are measuring differently um

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
for each of these personality traits

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,680
and you know you can see here for for

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
example head full of dreams is a bit

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,320
more upbeat

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
um everyday life is certainly a bit more

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,959
serious an album

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
um this is their first album you know

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,560
it's a lot

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
a lot of organization and sort of

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,710
cooperation and similarly so

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,120
here but a little bit more openness um

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,279
[Music]

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
and as i sort of progress through um

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,480
we're getting sort of more emotional

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,000
range in viva la vida um

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,080
and sort of milo xylodo

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
and yeah i think a really good way of

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,399
starting to sort of compare them is

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,760
by plotting over time so here i'm just

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,040
using chart jazz

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,080
taking the data from each year and

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,680
drawing it on a line chart and you can

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,399
see sort of

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,920
instantly how you know variable things

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,240
are over time

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,160
so um if i also just switched to sort of

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,160
looking at the albums in bar chart form

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,640
side by side as well

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,080
the big sort of outlier is ghost stories

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,560
here and agreeableness and

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
you know he wrote that album as his

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,600
marriage was breaking up with gwyneth

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,080
paltrow so

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
it's there's a lot more sort of sympathy

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,240
within there there's a lot more

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,160
melancholy

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,440
in inside it um a lot more hope

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,680
it's a really beautiful album um

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,240
but you know many of the other sort of

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,680
previous co-play albums to that were

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,200
um were a lot more about love songs

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
and indeed you know a head full of

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,000
dreams after it i wrote

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,240
the year after it as almost um

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
a reaction to ghost stories i've

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
deliberately wanted

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
a more upbeat cheerful album so it has

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
songs like a head full of dreams on

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,519
there

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
it has adventure of a lifetime him for

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,920
the weekend

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,959
whereas ghost stories has magic and

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,800
and um always in my head and

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,920
um sky full of stars on there so

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
they're their songs more you know about

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
about loss and

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,000
about um the sort of

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,399
um difficulties of that relationship

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,120
and then sort of as you look at everyday

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
life

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,959
everyday life is um

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,120
really starting to you know if you look

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,760
at the five preceding albums

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,360
it's really lifted up in terms of

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200
extroversion

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
and it's very different lyrically from

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
the others in that it's looking at

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,880
social issues like

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,920
the refugee crisis um

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,320
you know racial injustice so they have

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,320
dive

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
you know diverted themselves from the

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
sort of love song type formula

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,279
of the past and started looking more

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,959
seriously

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,920
at social issues um and you know

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,920
openness is relatively static the sort

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,000
of measurement of creativity

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,600
um it's relatively static it peaks at

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,600
viva la vida so that's

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
that's the one that's the most sort of

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,600
creative and certainly

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,399
what surprised me was you know it's also

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,760
one of the ones that's showing up as

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,000
most introverted

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
because visually they're they're quite

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,880
extroverted in it

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,160
but lyrically it's the most open album

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
um that they've recorded according to

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
you know this sort of analysis if you

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,959
look at something like trust here

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
you can see how ghost stories again you

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,600
know

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,000
that that very reflective album is um

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,639
is really really different from the

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,600
others in terms of the level of trust

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,600
within the lyrics

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,000
so that's that's a sort of interesting

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,600
feature

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
um and then sort of you look at things

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
like

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,360
cautiousness you know um

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,079
uh ghost stories is these are

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,279
all a lot more sort of cautious albums

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,079
and they're almost flooding

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,839
between um the the different sort of

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,600
one albums more cautious than the next

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,360
they're almost reacting against each

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
other so you sort of see that this the

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
general way it works

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
um i'm going to show you sort of the

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,120
data model behind

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,710
this it starts off with a timeline

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
so

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,800
[Music]

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
if i can just find it here and the

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,680
timeline is it's really

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:09,200
a json file i've got blocks

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,040
one sort of json entry for each album

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
so i've called them an era parachute

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,760
sierra rush of blood to the head

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,320
viva la vida so one for each album

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,560
there's an svg image that i've drawn

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
using illustrator to represent each

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,760
album

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,959
um and then there's a text file with the

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,240
song lyrics in there

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,279
so for instance um parachutes

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,639
is in here so don't panic um yellow

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,399
is in in here somewhere um sparks so all

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
these great songs there's yellow

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
and it's just the the words of them and

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,839
so what i'm doing with the timeline

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,600
i have this node.js file called

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,600
paperback writer

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,600
it's just it's a line reader it's

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,519
reading each of

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,320
the um the entries in that timeline json

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,600
file

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
invoking personality insights reading

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,279
you know the text file with the lyrics

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,760
in there and just getting playing that

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,800
through and then adding that into

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,199
um into the timeline and writing a brand

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
new file called copy.json

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
and so if i sort of do that really

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,760
quickly here

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
um you can see how quickly it's working

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,320
it's eight albums it's running eight

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,560
times

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,120
and we should get a new um coldplay.json

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,800
file

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,399
right right here um and you can see

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
you know it's got this timeline it's got

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
the same timeline stuff in there but it

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,760
also has the analysis

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,160
from what's in there with um the

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,360
different scores in there so that's how

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,079
it's tied together

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,000
um and there's there's a similar model

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,760
for the beatles and the beatles kiss

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,839
um i've used the sim approach

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,839
um but sort of

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
with if i can quickly find it here we go

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
so

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,600
in here i've sort of also started to

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,720
include the song titles in there

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
um so i'm gonna go more in distraction

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
in the future and i'll show you why i'm

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,639
doing that in a little while i've

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,120
enhanced the timeline data a little bit

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,160
that sort of brings us to you know the

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,079
second part

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,560
which is looking more at the sort of

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,839
houdini technology and like i was saying

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,199
i wanted to try and get

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,720
some some aspect of confetti going

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,519
um to see if i could sort of

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,000
start bringing that style into into my

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,800
little application

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
so houdini's part of a collection of new

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
apis

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,759
that are emerging uh that reach into the

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,800
css engine and

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
and this api the paint apis is one of

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,959
them

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,600
that i'm you know that's the one that

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,440
i'm using the showcasing today

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,959
and it's really cool it allows you to

00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,160
draw backgrounds using the canvas api

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,959
on your dom elements and then to

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
you know be able to set that as a style

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,880
using

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,240
custom css classes that you declare

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,959
um so i just quickly go through some of

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
that

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,320
to show you that in action so if i just

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
pop back here

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,040
and look at the houdini version you can

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,240
see hopefully

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,639
the um confetti

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,199
bar charts going up and down so this is

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,399
my attempt at confetti

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:35,600
and if i was to open up the

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,759
inspector and choose those so there's a

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,880
css class for each one this is extra

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,920
version

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,839
um for example

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,680
um here's one

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,519
for emotional range

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,800
i think i'm flip flooding around him a

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,160
little bit

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,000
um differently but here you can see it's

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
calling the background image

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
paint um confetti so that's

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,120
what the background image is and then

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,679
i've got these three custom parameters

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,199
color limit and size so i can change

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,199
dynamically change the color

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,959
if i was to change it to be purple for

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,319
instance you can see it's changing color

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,079
to be purple

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,760
again if i change it to be red it's

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,720
changing to be

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,480
um and i can change the sort of size of

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
those confetti flakes in there

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,799
so making them really big i'm making

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,919
them really tiny

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:34,080
and i can change the amount in there so

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,880
um if i reduce it down to 100

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,360
um see it a little differently so you

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,679
know it's

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,160
it's given you that sort of capability

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,320
of changing the style dynamically

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,400
i did a similar thing with stripes

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,160
so same bar charts this time round is a

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
custom class that's drawing diagonal

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
stripes within there

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,120
um and if i was to hook into one of

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
those

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,440
i can do the same sort of thing again i

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
can change it to be purple for instance

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,080
dynamically just in the same way that

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,480
you would change any css element here

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,640
you can change the size of the gap

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,160
between the stripes it's really small

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
really big giving you more of a

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,120
pinstripe effect and then the width the

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,919
stripes themselves um

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
so you know they're really really small

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
lines really

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
thick lines so it gives you that that

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,919
sort of hint of

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,280
being able to style things a little bit

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,320
differently

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,520
either in reaction to data or just and

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
you know to sort of

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,200
shake things up or riff on a style

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
system

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,720
if you like um when you start to look at

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
the

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,600
the code for that this is the sort of

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
anatomy of the css class you've got

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,880
you know a class where you declare the

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
name of it um

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
and then you've got your input

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
properties so

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,559
in my case i had input properties for

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,160
and in the stripes like the gap between

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,240
the stripes the width of the stripes

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,080
themselves the color of the stripes

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,360
and then there's this paint call so they

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,039
all have this paint call

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,720
where it passes in the context the html5

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,360
context that's your canvas that you're

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,600
drawing on the geometry size of that

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,760
height and width and then you can just

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,039
use um html5

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,080
canvas calls as you would

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,440
um you know where you're drawing just

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,559
on a regular html5 canvas surface

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
so a good example here is the stripes

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,120
one

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,679
where you can see i'm declaring these

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,000
input properties for color gap and width

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
here in the paint method i'm actually

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
reading what those

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,880
are and then putting them as local

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,919
variables like color

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,240
gap and widths and then calling draw

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,760
and we're passing in this the html5

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,120
context and the geometry

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,919
the so the dimensions and just really

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,679
just drawing

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,840
the stripes and you can see it's begin

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,799
path stroke style

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,640
line width move to line two standard

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,600
html5 canvas stuff

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
and that has got a little algorithm for

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,640
filling

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
the thing with with stripes there and

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,240
similarly so

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,159
in the confetti one this time it's it's

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,720
using sort of random

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:18,559
um you know placement of those things

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,720
but i'm just drawing you know rectangles

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,000
and placing them in somewhere in a

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,240
certain size and reading those

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
parameters for size and limits and so on

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,679
in there so that's how you sort of draw

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,559
those things you end up

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
with um a few files you know your

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,600
standard

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,039
html file for your dom elements your

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,640
standard css file

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,280
where you define your class oh sorry we

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,159
you you know fill in the details for

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,080
your class and then

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
there's a javascript file like i showed

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
you where you're defining the class

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,559
itself

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
and another one to register it my sort

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,000
of tips for building

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,240
your own stuff think of really fresh

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
ideas to enhance the user experience as

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,000
opposed to

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,280
just you know using it for the hell of

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
it um

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,640
i think it was going to be a sort of new

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,159
world where this stuff is going to be

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
emerging

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,320
you know custom css classes custom dom

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,280
elements with web components i think

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,799
it's it's

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,919
a really fascinating world that's

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,240
emerging so to start with just the raw

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,520
canvas first and then move it into that

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,559
sort of html skeleton for it and

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,919
sort of test iteratively experiment with

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,400
the variables once you get in there

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
because

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
more ideas will pop to life once you see

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,880
them

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
so i'm gonna just really demo how i've

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,919
used web audio with that

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
just to show um the sort of interaction

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,640
between

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,360
um the two things so here

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
we'll get a little clip of paradise by

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,159
coldplay

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
and you can see the confetti there

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,200
starting to move

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
i'm measuring the amplitude using the

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,520
web audio api again all of my code here

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,919
is open source i'll put the links at the

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,720
end

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,320
and you can see how i'm doing that but

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,440
i'm invoking

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,039
the css parameters um on

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,480
that that sort of file and changing the

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,240
size of the confetti

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,600
changing the color of it in reaction to

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,080
the amplitude

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
so it's not very scientific it's just

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
sort of

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,280
looking at the peaks of it and changing

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
but it's effective

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,679
so there's there's power in that as well

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
to be able to sort of

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,960
dynamically use these styles in

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,960
different ways

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,320
so that's sort of another interesting

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
side of it

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,640
so just to sort of quickly summarize why

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,120
does any of this matter

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,559
so i think it opens a new world for

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,960
creative visualization

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,679
it's a real sort of crossover between

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,120
design

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,799
and implementation so

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,480
you know as part of a design system you

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,320
start building these custom css classes

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,720
your visual designers can figure out

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,960
like how they want the design elements

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,320
um the engineers can work with the

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,120
visual designers to

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,360
create um you know a set of those that

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,960
can be reused and scaled and set up

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,200
differently depending on

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
you know what aspect of the website

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,039
needs to work in different ways and even

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,840
dynamically in reaction to different

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,520
interactions of our data that work

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
really beautifully with flex and grid

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,280
systems

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
easy to share and reuse from the natural

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,200
language sort of point of view

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
i'm really passionate about the the idea

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,120
of using that

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,559
in businesses even to learn more about

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,320
our interactions with clients and

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,280
customers and how

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,720
you know we see ourselves so really

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,320
quickly i just wanted to show you where

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,799
i'm going with some of this stuff

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,840
um so i've been working on

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,960
um at beatles example

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,360
if i just pop over here and show you

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
and so what i'm realizing is and i've

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,120
done a few examples now so

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,000
my boy example looks like this where

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,000
i've

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,559
you know built a little social network

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,520
of all of the david bowie's and

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,080
used um tweets to show it to share the

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,679
data

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,679
and inside there so um

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,919
and for the um for the hamilton one

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
it's really interesting here it's a

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,799
whole play with

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,640
just different characters as opposed to

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,120
different albums or errors and what i've

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
done is picked out each of their words

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,640
and compared them side by side and this

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
is remarkable in that it's all written

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,919
by one person through hip hop and yet

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
there's very distinctive

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,919
personality traits showing through so

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
that's you know just hopping around

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,360
those different

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,400
projects i'm realizing it's it's too

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,760
much work to keep

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,279
creating new um designs from each time

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,200
and i want to stand a way of doing it so

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,279
i can just really concentrate on looking

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,200
more at lyrics from now on

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,120
um i'll probably blog more about this

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
beatles one in the coming weeks

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,480
um as opposed to going to the details

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,039
now

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,880
um but what i wanted to show it like so

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,840
this is done through web components

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
it's reusable i'm gonna go back and put

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,679
bowie into the same format

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,799
co-play into the sim format i'm starting

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,480
to use the lyrics

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,080
all right so the song titles in here so

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,840
that you can sort of relate the song

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,600
titles to what's going on

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,360
through the traits as time is changing

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,279
and then here um what i'm doing if you

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,559
look at the psychedelia era

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,279
um there's very subtle but i've got some

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,000
houdini

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,919
going on down here for little flowers if

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,039
i make them be red

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,440
you can see them more easily and

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
it's just random little flowers drawn

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,080
and

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
you know i can change the size of them

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,240
for instance

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,360
so here they're bigger i can change the

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,559
number of petals

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
in each of the flowers

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,240
so they look a bit more like snowflakes

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
if i put lots in there

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,480
and i can change the number that's

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,679
showing up in there so

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
if i just change it to be tens maybe a

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,120
little

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
you can see it a little easier so you

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,919
can see that you know there's

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,240
the prospect for being able to

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,960
dynamically style things

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,159
to a theme which is really interesting

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
um

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,799
again we sort of look at here i've put

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,840
a subtle um

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,840
zebra crossing style in there so if i

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,159
can change it to be purple you can see

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,360
to sort of mimic the abbey road and i'm

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,480
starting to use these custom styles to

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,760
um subtly sort of pale match to the

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
um to the album covers or or the themes

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,120
that are going on in there here you've

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,840
got like little heads showing

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
like the hard dyes might cover on there

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,720
i really love this one

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,400
um with um

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,080
a sort of scribble effect like the

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,840
scribble and the revolver album

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,919
so again if i change this color to be

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,520
red you can see it a little bit more

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
and here i've got a sort of wobble in

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
the scribbles if i've changed

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,360
that to be a bigger wobble you can see

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,559
the difference in in the gaps

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
in there so fun ways of sort of using

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,480
that

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,400
um technology um and again

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,559
looking at sort of the the the timelines

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,080
of the beatles you can see

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,600
the emotional range dips for the

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,120
psychedelia era

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,159
and you know climbs again as as as they

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,760
progress through and they're open as

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,000
peaks at the psychedelia

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
era so their creativity is at its peak

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,120
at that point

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,440
um again i'm going to blog more about

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,880
this project i just wanted to to sort of

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
give you a glimpse of where i'm going

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
with it

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,600
using web components and sort of

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,159
creating a standard way and

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,600
i hope to do another talk in the future

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
with

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,720
a few different new artists i want to do

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,520
prints i want to do some um crowded

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,960
house

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,679
um radiohead like get some more

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
albums going and at some point i'd

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
really like to be able to

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,159
cross compare the artists as well and

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,600
and sort of work

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,679
through that kind of thing um so that's

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,799
a really lightning fast overview of

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
um these crazy projects and a little bit

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
of

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,720
houdini in there a little bit of live

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,520
audio

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,440
um i didn't dig into the web components

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,679
hopefully another time i can

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,520
i can sort of come back and show you

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,919
where all of this is going

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,760
really grateful to city jazz for the

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,760
opportunity to talk

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,679
um and uh wish everyone well

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,240

thanks very much

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,459
[Music]

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,440
so your talk went really well anton are

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,440
you happy with it

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,720
um yeah i mean i think it's uh

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
it's it's definitely sort of given me

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
more insight into myself and the way i'm

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,520
presenting

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,360
um i'd much much sooner have done it

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
live obviously but yeah i was really

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,640
happy with

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,240
with how it came together thanks it's a

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,520
very exciting project i'm sure we're

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,600
gonna have loads of uh

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,640
questions on it um i'm gonna start us

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,840
off with

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,760
why coldplay beatles and bowie

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,360
um so i i started with bowie mostly

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,360
um after just after he died because i

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
found myself watching lots of videos and

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,679
interviews

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,760
and um i almost became a bit obsessed so

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,320
it was like trying to just to

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,960
build a timeline and draw the different

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,200
icons of him and

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,960
as i was drawing them he was really

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
distinctive era by era

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,000
and i thought you know when he's

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,520
coloring his face and are wearing

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,880
different clothes is he also writing

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,840
songs differently

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,480
and that's why i wanted to use this

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,399
psychology

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,559
insights tools to see if there was a

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,360
different psychology in each era

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,240
and then co-play was mostly because they

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,679
were just really amazing live

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,799
the beatles because uh i learned guitar

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
to the beatles songs

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,279
so um i'm just you know i want to do

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,559
more and more of them

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,679
um i've a teenage son who

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,640
um just this weekend got me to help him

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,679
do mac miller who i knew often about

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,720
um and uh and yes he was

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,440
he was really into that so um we found a

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,559
way of doing it

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,039
pretty pretty fast now so more automated

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,159
um

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,399
ever just since i've given the talk

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,840
i could almost get a new talk on how

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,799
we've automated it

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,000
well we've got 10 minutes we've also got

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,840
a couple of questions so we should

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
probably open those first

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,200
and so the first one and this comes from

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
michael

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,120
do we have to run css houdini on an

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,200
external server

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,760
um yeah i think that there is there

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,559
may be ways of um

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,799
[Music]

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,240
of using some cross scripting thing or

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
you know cross-site shipping soon but

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
i've not found any

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,760
um any other way of doing it you do need

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,120
to load the javascript in there

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,399
and um actually i'm not sorry

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,320
i'm going to rewind you can you can do

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,120
it all locally you don't need

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,320
a an external server for it you can do

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,679
it all

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,840
just the same way you're using

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,519
javascript and and

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,200
css for local development

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,960
okay but it does need to be loaded up on

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,519
a server is that right

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,200
even if it's a local one um i'm

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
um i don't think it i don't think it

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,320
does actually i think yeah i think you

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
can get away with it

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,000
even better even lower barrier of entry

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,519
that's fantastic

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,159
and so the next one is all about

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,880
performance have you experienced any

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,919
performance

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,039
issues while rendering with houdini

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,880
yes um so

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,480
depending on what you want to do and how

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,120
sophisticated your

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,480
you know your drawing is it's it's uh

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,320
you know html5 canvas beneath the covers

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
um so for the confetti for instance it

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,320
was pretty busy um

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,320
and i animated that so there's no

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,320
natural animation um

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,039
i'm cheating by passing in a trigger to

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,760
to get it to animate um and yes so the

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,039
the more

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,320
um action you put into your drawing

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,640
the higher the head on performance

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,919
um there are some really sweet aspects

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,559
of it as well like if you're used to

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,919
drawing with

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,600
html5 canvas in that um

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,519
you usually have to measure pretty

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,399
carefully when you're working with html5

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,720
canvas

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,960
and then write your own code to

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,360
dynamically change your rendering

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,240
with css houdini you get a whole bunch

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,399
of that for free

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,559
like so it's you're changing the

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,440
dimensions of your html elements

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,960
it's passing the um the dimensions of

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,640
those in and compensating

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,880
and it does a really nice job it's

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,120
almost a nicer way of using the canvas

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,559
api yeah it can't be tricky working with

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,480
the canvas api but

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,159
i wonder whether you think houdini is

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,080
going to make it easier

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,360
is the actual abstraction a good thing

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,240
do you think

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,279
um i've been wondering about that um in

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,919
general because you need

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,399
it's like definitely heading that

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,200
crossover between design and development

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,519
and um i i don't know if it's going to

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
be

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,880
you know it's going to take a special

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
breed of animal to want to get into

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,519
that that sort of crossover you know for

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,600
a lot of like

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,200
designers um it might be a bit too

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,639
technical for them to program

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,399
and the canvas side for a lot of

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,040
software engineers it might be too much

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,960
designed to

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,240
get and so there's there's a definite

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,240
sort of overlap

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:24,159
and i think um there's an element of

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:28,079
you know it solves it it's um solving

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,760
a problem or it's a solution to

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,359
you know a problem that doesn't really

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,040
exist to some extent

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,040
so i think it's going to find its way

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,240
and and i think the secret really is

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,240
within those um style

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,839
systems and being able to dynamically

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,919
change um

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,119
the style of something in reaction to

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,320
data or reaction to interaction of it

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,839
and that's new um and so that's really

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,280
interesting for me i think it's

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,839
it's offering a lot of scope for that

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,119
yeah speaking of scope web components

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,200
bring loads of it and that's what our

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,640
next question is about dwayne started by

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,440
saying it was a great talk

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
so yeah thank you on his behalf what

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,880
went into

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,880
creating and implementing your interface

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,560
with web components

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,560
yeah so i've just started doing that and

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,520
i've been using them within my work at

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,560
ibm

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,079
more recently as well um

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,839
so i'm kind of phobic of of the big

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,680
um like javascript libraries i'm

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,599
old and jaded by all of this stuff and

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,079
they come and go so

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,640
um i really like a lot of the aspects of

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,680
things

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,720
um like react where

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,680
it's using componentized um blocks in

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,800
there

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,599
but i really also it's a lot of appeal

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,720
for me to have them work natively

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,240
um so just sort of digging into the the

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,280
native

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,960
usage of the components of like

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,839
building your custom html blocks and

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,880
um locking the css to each of those

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,000
things

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,560
um works pretty effectively um

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,920
and yeah my code is sort of open source

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,119
it's

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,960
it's um fairly easy to follow i think

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,480
and it works it works pretty well there

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,240
are a few good

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,960
um you know tutorials on mozilla and

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,640
things like that

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
teach you how to do it where i fall

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,320
short is loading them um

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,480
because there isn't a really cool way of

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
you know loading them loading the files

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,720
in the panel you need to load all of

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,240
your

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,599
definitions for um for the templates

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,760
together

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,440
and then each of the javascript

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
implementations for those templates can

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,320
be loaded separately if

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,920
if you could sort of segment them and

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,680
load them all in blocks it would be much

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,119
much better

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,119
hopefully somebody's listing you can

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,000
help put that into the browser i guess

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,680
yeah or i could step up and contribute

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,400
yeah and you're setting yourself a big

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,079
challenge there i think yeah

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
and on that note we're going to have to

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,359
call time on this q a because the next

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,599
talk is about to finish

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,359
uh and that about to start sorry um i am

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,000
so slightly that our conversation wasn't

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,640
interrupted

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,160
by police sirens i was promised oh yeah

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,240
they would

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,680
well yeah i think you just missed one

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,079
and you certainly dismissed some

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
construction and they uh condo next door

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,359
they're building a condo next door and

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,800
blasting so you missed that by minutes

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
which is a good thing

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,920
that is a good thing on that note i'm

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,920
going to leave before the next blast

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,480
absolutely amazing i'm looking forward

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
to re-watching it again and really

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,640
diving into the code it's

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,480
i love uh hip-hop so i'm looking forward

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,440
to taking your project and applying some

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,800
hip-hop to it

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,079
not mcmillan though it'll be good

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,079
hip-hop okay

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,960
thanks to everybody watching along if

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,880
you head back over to youtube the next

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
talk from jemima will be starting at any

00:37:50,880 --> 00:38:05,280
moment now

00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:07,359
and that's on we'll see you again cheers

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,359
