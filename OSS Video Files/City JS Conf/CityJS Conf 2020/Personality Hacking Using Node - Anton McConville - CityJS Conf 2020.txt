Title: Personality Hacking Using Node - Anton McConville - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	"In this inspiring and fascinating talk, we use AI and NLP to analyse the big five personality traits of a song writer over the span of their career. We use digital drawings and data visualisations to create a well designed interactive web application that helps us explore the personality data, and compare the stages of an artistâ€™s work.

We explore the use of the emerging CSS Paint API Spec ( based on JavaScript Canvas APIs ) . We look at how to build with it, and consider the exciting future for web applications as CSS Paint becomes a standard. We review tips and approaches for using the specification.

Finally we integrate analysis for the Web Audio JavaScript API, and consider the potential for creating rich multimedia experiences with CSS Houdini and Web Audio.

The session steps through the open source code, analyses the outcomes, and considers real world applications for the concepts."
