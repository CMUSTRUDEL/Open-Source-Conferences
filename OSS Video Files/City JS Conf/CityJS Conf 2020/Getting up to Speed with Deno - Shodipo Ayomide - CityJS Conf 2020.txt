00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
simply my name is chitopayamide i

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,119
am a senior developer advocate and

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
developer programs manager

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,359
that's what i do throughout i'm a github

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,679
star club general media developer expert

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,680
and

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
um community evangelist so these are all

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
of the things i do and yeah so let's get

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,200
right into

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,879
the good stuff so what

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
is you know this is the big question um

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,520
the really big question wherever okay

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
what exactly do you know what i get

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
talking about

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
is like undone node.js is it like uh

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,600
like under the runtime but

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,760
no so i'm going to tell you what node

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
dino is and how exactly this works and

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
how this you should basically utilize

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,520
this and also

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,520
um how you can um deploy um dino apps um

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,640
to production and get to reuse

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,239
um yeah anyone and yeah so um

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
dino is a modem secure in time for

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
javascript and telescopes not just

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
javascript and typescript that runs on

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
the v8 engine and builds um fully with

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
rust from the ground up um supports that

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
screen out of the box

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
um that's dinner simply so do not is um

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
one of the key factors about dino is a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
secure

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,560
it's a secured part and um you're gonna

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
love do you know once i get right into

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,200
it so dino basically is um

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,280
uh secured by default um it doesn't have

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
any access to your local network um by

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
default unlike node.js that has access

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
to every single thing

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
once you um install it globally he has

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
every single

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
on your system but dino doesn't have

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,960
access to your local network um doesn't

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
have access to your c

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
drive or any of that so it doesn't have

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
you know those access to your c drive

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,560
um by default also doesn't have access

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
to your local network um yeah unless you

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,799
give it access i'm going to show you how

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
to do that

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,119
um in a couple of minutes

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
so the first thing when you're working

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
with dino is so genome basically is a

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
single executable

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,520
with no dependencies so there's nothing

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
like dino modules so if anyone's going

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,799
to be accidents

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
so it's like they know node.js you have

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600
node.js modules

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,840
uh there's nothing like dino modules

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
because why is zero dependencies we

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,599
don't have anything that is basically

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
um executed by just one singular i'm

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,640
going to show you how to do that so um

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
for your mac and linux this is the code

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
you use when you want to start and when

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
you want to install your um dino

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
globally on your mac

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,440
um or your linux um system but you guys

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
in windows powershell like your default

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
terminal

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,520
um you put in that url you can also find

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,480
this url and copy them from

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
gnu.land that's the official website so

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
yeah

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
once you have this installed we're going

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,440
to move into the next step basically i'm

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
working on with you know so the next

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,040
step basically so once you put down this

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,360
url so i'm using a mac so i put in the

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
curl url um and downloading the global

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
my system you see

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,680
it it works exactly the same way as this

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,959
and it's super fast even on the

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,720
like a really slow connection i tried

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,920
that also to my surprise it was like

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,879
way fast i'm like wow let's shoot this

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,560
just super fast

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,560
so just put that into the into your

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,040
terminal and yeah just hit enter and

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
a couple of seconds and boom it's up

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
super fast

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,360
so we're to talk about the how to serve

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
your dinner um we're going to talk

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
firstly about the

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
remote url so this is one way to save

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
your general applications

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,519
so dino um allows you to host files on

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
remote urls and execute them

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,280
from the url from the url in your

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,599
terminal and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,360
correct example here is in my next slide

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,760
so for example um it's as simple as you

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
can

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,440
you using a command called dino run so

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,360
any at any time you want to run a dna

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
application either from a url or from a

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
file

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
you always have to use a command called

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
dino run so same way we have we have

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,560
things like um yan viewed

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
we have um we have npm starts we have

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
all of that so this is dino run

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,239
so do you know and then the url with the

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
function we would like to execute in our

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,799
tummy now

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
and we get a response so now what i'm

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
trying to say here is that

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,680
we have a url where we want to get some

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,480
so we want to fetch um

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
the content of this url um yeah like

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
basically from the terminal itself not

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,959
without writing any single line of code

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,680
um yeah so just use the neuron then url

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,439
so this automatically gets um the

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
content of this url that we have so

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,519
it's automatically going to console log

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
um now the reason why this is

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
logging right now is because on this

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
work on this typescript file that we

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,640
have as welcome.ts um

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,680
we have work on the cs right here um

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
this exactly

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
is console login welcome to dino so

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
that's why it's giving us the content

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
and

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
the code being run is compiling it and

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
giving us the outputs here

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,800
in our console that's why we have this

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
here

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
so um this has been logged as you can

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
see right here in the screenshot

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
it's been console.log here so it's what

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
we have in our constitute.log here

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,360
in this remote url that we put into um

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,560
our terminal by using do no run

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
then the url of the um of the um

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,160
projects whatever we want to run and

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
gives us the output in our terminal

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,120
so basically that's remote then we're

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
going to go to the next thing which is

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
um

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
saving it from a project itself so after

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
the installation

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
we have to um just really create a

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
simple function um

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
and save uh basically we're just going

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
to create a

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,320
simple hello world project and we're

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
going to just go we're just going to

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
like go from there

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
so first step is create a projects

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
folder called you know example this

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
you can call it whatever you want mine

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
i'm calling the general example

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
next things you're going to create a

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
file called um helloworld.ts that's

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,039
hello world that's a taskbar file called

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
hello.ts

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
um we're going to add a simple function

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
to serve hello world so yeah that's

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,440
simple let's get right into the good

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,039
stuff

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,759
so um now as you can see right here we

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
are importing

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,800
um a package from a url and we are going

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,600
to be saving that on a port 8 000

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,120
not 3000 like react but here is 8000 and

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
to show that so we will be able to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
access this and click and know that okay

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
it has been successfully um

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,000
served we are considered login our

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,520
localhost 8000. so once this

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
is successful automatically done all of

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,440
this and it's listing already on

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
airport 8000 this has been considered

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,520
locked

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,919
and sorry so lastly we just created a

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,360
simple

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,560
uh faraway blue which is going to stand

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
by we're going to push our hello world

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
into here

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,080
so um now when you do all of these

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,479
things yeah so this is basically just a

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
simple

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
hello world function that's just

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,319
basically what this is so the next thing

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
you're going to talk about

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080
is um dino doesn't um have access to

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,199
your local network as i said earlier he

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
doesn't you know doesn't have access to

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
anything that's

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
your local network he doesn't have

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
access to your local host so um this is

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
basically for security business one of

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
major reasons why you know would be um

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
going places

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
it is 100 secure and it's super exciting

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
about this so um every time you would

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,160
like to execute a command you have to

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,319
use something called an allow

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,240
network flag so every time you want to

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
execute a dino command you want to

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
um compile something you want to get

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
something out there you have to use the

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
allow network command so it's going to

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
allow um

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,000
certain incoming networks to come in

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
nothing it's not just anything that just

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
comes in

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,840
uh into your code i'm going to show you

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,680
how to do that right now

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
so we have written this simple command

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
we have a member now i said we have a

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
folder here called you know

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,759
example then inside of our coordinator

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
example we created a file called

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,840
helloworld.cs so it has a file called

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
hello.ts

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,120
and a symbol function for hello world so

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,960
we've done that already

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
now we now know about the allow network

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
um tag flag that we can um use when

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
we're serving our dna application i want

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
to compile them

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and yep get uh yeah get a result on a

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,039
local host

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
so what we're gonna do is so now um to

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
get a server running you have to

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
initiate that dino in the terminal by

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
running remember again i said you know

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
run

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
into me on youtube application you

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,680
always have to use the dino run command

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
so do you know wrong then look at it

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
double hyphen

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
allow hyphen network then the name of

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
the file you want to compile

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,160
as simple as that that's basically just

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,840
a moment that's just a route you want to

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
compile and here we're compiling our

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,880
hello world

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
um file that we created the skyscraper

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
hello world file so we're going to run

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,680
dino run

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,919
um allow network then helloworld.cs

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,440
so once you hit enter and you've written

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
this in your terminal you've done like

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
you hit

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
enter automatically to show you how

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
secure the noise dino has to request for

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
your system permissions

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
to um give you access give dino access

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,560
to your um accepts incoming networks

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,479
from your system so you

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,680
i don't have to allow or deny this so

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
you have the permission to do all of

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,240
this with node.js no just doesn't allow

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
you to do all of this

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
um once it's installed the other guys

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,560
almost everything but here in dino you

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
have to give access

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
as you work so now um wait this is my

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,080
first time setting up dino

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
so um if this is your first time you're

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
going to see this thing too so um do you

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
know ron you're allowed in that

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
instagram you allow incoming network

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
then you have to specify the route or

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,800
the file you want to um

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
uh compile then you get this pop-up

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
saying um

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
do you want this application dino to

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,599
accept incoming network connections

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,879
click deny so deny will stop it from

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,599
working then allow

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,919
um would allow you to allow um allow the

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
function while we create that

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,080
that basically that hello that task that

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,360
we created to fully compile

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,040
and um and uh be served on uh localhost

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
8000 so that's basically what it's going

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
to happen click allow so when you see

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
this pop-up when you're

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
using dino for the first time you have

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
to click on allow on this there's

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
nothing that's going to happen this is

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,360
this is totally part of the process so

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,880
once you allow this so automatically

00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
it's been served to your localhost it's

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
awesome so

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
you just have that popup and just click

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,600
allow it takes you back to your

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
terminal where you have um this so once

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
this happens you just have to click the

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
localhost 8000 then once you click this

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
um

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,279
automatically you like you just go

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
straight to your web browser and

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,279
you see a preview like this

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,040
so once you visit this um on your

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,880
browser this is exactly what you see

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,720
now i'm going to go back a bit to the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
function we created um in our hello

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,279
world typescript

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
so basically the exact same hello world

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
response we are sending to our faraway

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
function here

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
is um rather for our for our weight loop

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,120
here is what um we are getting right

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,839
uh here in the browser just as simple as

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,680
that so we have

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
basically right now a simple dna

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,920
application that we can use

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
so we have seen how to get um what we

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,959
have um how to um

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,519
serve from a url that we have coding for

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,240
example

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,399
i said before we had um we had a unique

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,320
url where we had um consolidated

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,560
login welcome to dino then all we did

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,720
was did something like dino run then the

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,200
url it automatically constructed logged

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
um

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
the contents of that url into our

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
terminal so we've done that now

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
don't have to um how to service the

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
application for my local from a project

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
entire script i said use typescript

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
because javascript is something i want

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,279
can you really

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
for javascript is the same process same

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
process for js well i'm trying to use ts

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
here so everyone can see how we um

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
it comes like outside of the box i

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,800
didn't have to install any dependencies

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
i didn't have to install anything it

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
just comes

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
like just come with dinner itself so um

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
we're going to talk a little bit more

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,040
about making http requests in dino

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
so um get some contents in the fetch api

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,920
and console.log

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
um a response that's impressive this is

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
what happens here so here we are getting

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
your eyes in there for it

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
i'm sorry i can't get um so i'm gonna

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
show you an example that gonna show you

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,600
like we're trying to fetch something

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,160
from here so where is we have url um

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
we are gonna put an official url in here

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,680
then we're gonna see what

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
we're gonna get so i have i created a

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,480
simple http request into and i'm gonna

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,399
fetch what we have in our core.cs file

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,680
so so basically if you can look at what

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,440
i have here um

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,800
again i'm gonna lay a fancies on the

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
fact that i did something called

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,480
the allow network because every single

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
time i want to run a demo application

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
if you do not allow network it would

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
never work it wouldn't go it wouldn't

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,399
fly

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,600
no one would um it wouldn't be able to

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,800
compile nothing would happen it's going

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
to throw an error saying

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
um you have to allow network you have to

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
do an allow network flag

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,600
not like um node.js you can just like

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
pushing that just like just happens like

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
just like that because he has access to

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
every single thing but hearing do you

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
know you always have to allow network

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,279
every time you want to compile any file

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
so as you can see i did um dino run

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:43,040
aloud network um

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:46,480
okay one sec

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,760
okay um yeah okay okay okay

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
okay i thought i made a mistake

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
somewhere so yeah um there's no mistake

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,040
anywhere so um

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,079
you might be wondering so this was put

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,079
in so we might have to focus um

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
um i deleted the the function i wrote

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
for the hello world component

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,680
um so i deleted that and i'm an operator

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,120
is um this fetching um api here where i

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,959
can build fetch whatever you guys been

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
um access what's being kept into this

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,880
url

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,320
then that's what i'm running here so

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,920
same process i did before that i

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,680
compiled the hello world file that's

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
extension i did here so i i'm writing

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,959
during the run as you just said before

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,639
then i'm allowing network and i'm

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,399
compiling my hello.js file

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,279
um usually when i i think this is

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
something that everyone should even

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,440
really do and

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
anytime you're like giving talks or

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
giving always try to name your files so

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
you don't get lost

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,600
because you have a number of files

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,000
because usually you just you always add

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
right here you had as hello hyphen world

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
dot cs

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
so you know what exact file um you're

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
gonna be talking about it helps you

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,200
keep track of things oh yeah i think i

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,560
should start doing that

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
so yeah let's keep moving forward so

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,680
once so basically once we do this

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
automatically um

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
should i put this it will not give us

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,519
the content it fits the content of this

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,480
curly um cs file so if we open this in a

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,639
browser um

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
so if you open this url in your browser

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
what exactly you're going to see

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,519
is what is being fetched right here the

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
exact same thing that's what's being

00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
fresh right here and nothing more

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,200
nothing extra

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
this is what exactly we are getting from

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,639
that simple url

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,560
so remember again um we added

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,760
the alarm network flag because i want to

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
lay so much emphasis on the allow

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
network file because this is really um

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,200
one of the most exciting thing about

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,279
dino

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
whenever any incoming connection wants

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,079
to come into do you know

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
you have to allow access whatever coming

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,720
going on you have to always allow the

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,160
network access if you don't do this

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,079
you're going to draw an error

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
um so um as you see here we've had some

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,120
data from the regular example.com domain

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,560
so we are facing

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
some data from this um regular

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
example.com domain that we all use

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,920
um and it's giving us the exact thing

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,639
that we want um to avoid any background

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,959
coming in

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,760
um you know secured so um yeah this is

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
something that's so

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,519
exciting i i would like i just could

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
just keep on talking about it

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,680
dino is secured and yeah that's one

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,959
reason why she's you know

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
so one other thing i'm going to talk

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
about is so you have a dinner

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
application installed so we have um

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,199
we have this let's say for example we

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,560
have a hell world application running

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,040
automatically in our browser

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,959
we have this preview now how exactly do

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,639
we deploy the hello world application

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,199
how do we deploy this as an api or

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,720
something

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,240
how do we do that and how we're going to

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
deploy that to you vaso

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,800
and that's what i'm going to show you in

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,800
the next one so

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
the point you know um deploying a dinner

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
app on basil

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,959
um so fastest two sites um it's pretty

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,519
straightforward and like really super

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,519
amazing so let's get right into this

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
so um the first thing um you would do is

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
to create a folder

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,680
and call our folder api so still in

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
arduino example file

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,519
for the radar we're going to create um

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
another folder still on that file called

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,040
you know example rather

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
api we're going to call that file api

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,160
and the hello world

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,480
taskbar that we have we're going to drag

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
that file and drop it into our api

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
directory because um every ipad i want

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,839
to work on it has to be in the photo

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,399
called api that's basically how it works

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,680
already so next we're gonna um we what

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,480
we're gonna do is to get the current

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
version um and yeah just really so

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,720
basically

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,920
now we're gonna be creating like another

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
very small application where we're just

00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
going to be getting the current version

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
of our um

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
dino program and we're going to be

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
deploying that to the site

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,120
that's just what we're going to be doing

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,120
in this case

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,240
so um deploying a dino app on versus so

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,000
basically what is happening here is we

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,000
are importing the api gateway

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
uh for event and resources and context

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
then um we are literally um saying

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,639
what should be explained what should we

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
return to client is welcome to denote

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
then the dino current version

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
and that's all so basically what the

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,199
client is going to be seeing once we

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,880
enable this to work is the current

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,000
version of the new whatever version i'm

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,600
working on and um

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
remember i didn't have to do anything

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
like do you know install

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,480
so i can question like dino modules like

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
what we have for node

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
node.js node module so we don't need to

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
any of that so we just have to imagine

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
i'm just importing this

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,399
from uh lambda.ts let's simplify that

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,360
then yeah

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,800
we're going to get this welcome to

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
denote and the version of you know we

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,759
are currently working on

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,759
so the next slide um next we're gonna in

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
our roots folder so you know now

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,560
first the first thing we did we had a

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,519
folder this is now this structure before

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
that we have right now

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,800
um we're not live coding this so i'm i'm

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,160
gonna have to visualize so you can truly

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
understand um the process of which i'm

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
following

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,240
so i have like a folder called dino

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,800
example and in this folder

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
i have another folder called api then in

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
the photo

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
api i have another photo another file i

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
have a file called hello iphone world

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,079
dot cs

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,279
um okay okay invite what i said earlier

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,639
about renaming your

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,480
um your slides your um your code

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,759
code blocks i think i've got from kabul

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
from carbon another sh

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
um this always helps you keep track of

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
so you know what you're working on so as

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,759
you can see

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,680
i'm like i have this code inside my

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,959
hello world hello iphoneworld.css file

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
that's where i have this and the next

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,399
file we're creating basically in our

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,120
roots directory so we're going to go a

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
step back

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,120
and go like our main directory where we

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,519
have the api file we are going to um

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
create a canada file called version.json

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
so every single time you want to deploy

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,000
an application to facial you must always

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
have something called the

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
basic.json file well but then that's for

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,759
like some product if you want to have

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,519
like static servers like react

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,120
you don't you need to have a

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
vertical.json file or

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
if you have if you're not aware of the

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
of the rebranding of vasil

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,919
before you always have something like

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,959
now.json so

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,120
you don't need to have any of this you

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,039
have to put on a static um file to

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,880
another jason or vasil jason they are

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
both the same thing um but

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,640
according to of course the rebranding is

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
now versus.json to avoid any conflict

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,679
survivor survivor.json so if you are

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,439
deploying the server in this case we

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,480
have to have the password.json so in

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,919
your root folder you create a

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
varsity.json file and

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,839
um you basically set it around so i said

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
that now runtime to now do your ads so

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,360
this is the official api view function

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,960
built for that version created

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
so adding this thing here automatically

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
um builds uh the application

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
inversio in your so if you go to your

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,520
vasel dashboard under the logs you get

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
to see how this works

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
um i don't have a screen screenshot for

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
that but yeah you're gonna see how it

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,799
works

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,080
so um once that's done once you you

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
don't set another version of the json

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,320
file

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
and um so you have to go next just go to

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
your timing now and do something called

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
now hyphen double hyphen then production

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
that's prod prod

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,280
so um this basically so you have two

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,760
options so that you just do

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
now and automatically deploys that's one

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
but then another way is to um so once

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
you do

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,320
like regular now it just deploys and it

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,360
deploys on

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
sorry it deploys on a random url you can

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,240
have like

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,520
um um dino iphone example iphone xyz

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
iphone b-i-s-a-y it's gonna be anything

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
at all but when you're deploying to

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,039
production you have an opportunity or

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,400
you have an official name that um that

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,919
is gonna be the point to and as you can

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
see when i deployed to my now production

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,559
server i am having my production url

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,840
as um dino hyphen api i have an example

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,919
the vasudeva app

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,679
so um and also automatically been copied

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
to keyboard um yeah automatically once

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,919
it's

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
been deployed so yeah it's really that

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,720
simple then um once this is set

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
all you have to do is um this url we

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,559
have here as a production url

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,039
you just have to copy this or click this

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,120
um and this opens in your browser

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,520
and um for those um you can do this

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
right now i have this app running live

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
um i'm going to share the link to this

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
project um i'm going to share it

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
probably i don't i'm going to find a way

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
that you can access it or you can take a

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,360
look at it

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,360
so um you're going to just visit do you

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,400
know hyphen api have an example delta

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,160
vasilda app

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
so once you visit um you're going to see

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,080
the small application i created um of me

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,039
deploying it versus the repo is public

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,120
i'm going to share

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
that also so you can also get to see how

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
i did all of this

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
in the repo itself is on my github i'm

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,799
going to talk about that before i

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,320
end on this talk so yeah so the next

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,360
step is obviously url as you said

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,160
earlier and

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
you're going to view what's been

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
deployed and the most important part

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,679
here is you haven't worked apis before

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,679
you now once you visit url you get to

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,960
see just a regular you see files you see

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,240
the json file you see uh the api file

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
and i think i have a

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,440
git ignore file then you see a git

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
ignore file so you see all of this files

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,559
but then like you similar preview

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
so what you have to do is you route to

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,679
where your hello your task file your

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,320
hello what's your fault is so this is

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,799
our api directory so what we do is we do

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
um forward slash api forward slash hello

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,520
hyphen world

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
then this takes us directly to where our

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,799
api is so

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,039
what we basically covered today we

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,880
started from how dino works what exactly

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,000
gino is and how exactly can we get

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
started working with you know whites

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,159
actually just you know

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,039
dino doesn't have things like um node

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
modules or

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,320
genome modules so funny that you know

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,200
modules yeah there's nothing like that

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,559
um it's super light super secured um one

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
of the major things that makes um

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,000
applications really heavy

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
um the react is our node mode this is

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,720
super heavy

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,720
um if you want to look at how heavy it

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
is and um just want to like just

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,159
try it out um there's some there's a

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
there's a there's a package called the

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
webpack module analyzer

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
um so this basically um how this works

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
is so once you get this installed you

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,320
just have to set up your webpack

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
um configuration then once you have this

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,200
just running mp ram viewed automatically

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
creates a url

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,400
sorry it's not currently um it's been

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,440
listed on ports uh

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,919
127.0.0.1 so once you click this

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,039
you see a preview of um the sizes of

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,280
each of the files

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
that you have in your project so just

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,559
navigate to node modules

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,799
so you can see how heavy node modules is

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,080
so it's super heavy and um

00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,520
yeah it just really makes things like

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,559
really hard to explain when you're

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,280
working it's working with a slow

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
connection

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,480
in some countries we do not have like

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
super fast internet

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,760
you would um you would struggle to do

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,280
this kind of things so um there's not

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,880
like node mode this is super like

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
typescript comes out of the box you

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,520
don't need to have any like manual

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
installation for typescript it just

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,480
comes

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,320
with everything all together and you can

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
sell you can deploy you can um

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,159
compile files directly from a url link

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,440
you can start them by creating

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,120
simple folder we actually have to create

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,240
a folder we created you know example we

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,440
created um

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,799
uh we created a um we got a typescript

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
file called hello.js we were a simple

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,640
hello world function where we

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,840
sent out uh we served um symbol

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,600
application in the client and

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
so when you said look i was eight

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,840
thousand you saw

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,039
um hello world we did that um so yeah we

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,720
also saw how to deploy

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:49,120
our um dino app straight to versio

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,520
we did that also so you've done all of

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,760
this part and preview is from this link

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,880
so yeah um there's a little resources

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,400
that i need to take a look at so if you

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
want to see the repo i created

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,200
so my github handle is developer ios or

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,679
developer ao so developer then ayo

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,039
so github.com forward slash developer io

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,240
then the name of the repo is dino

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,080
example

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,760
then if you want to visit us um this

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
little app i created um just

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,440
you don't see that it's on it's so it's

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,080
the same repo but then deploy is

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,720
the deploy um app is on dino hyphen

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,039
example

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,320
hyphen api i have an example.vasel app

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
and always remember to

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
navigate to the api then the hello world

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
file so you can see um

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
the preview because it's going to have

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,840
to compile and like give you a preview

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,480
um that the official website is

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,600
denote.land

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,039
so yeah um thank you very much if you

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
have any questions i'm going to be on

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,440
remo

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,799
so i can have a chat with people who

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,240
have questions and you can also follow

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:55,840
me on twitter

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:55,840
and on github at developer io thank you

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,960
[Music]

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
sure

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,799
so well done on a brilliant talk and

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,280
like i said in the outro

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,960
i dino is something that i know about

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
but i've not necessarily looked into and

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,280
i think

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
you've encouraged me that it's worth a

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,760
look

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,400
yeah this is exciting so super excited i

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,080
said moving so fast

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
well you can take a moment now to break

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,600
maybe we should do that with every uh q

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,159
and a session just uh

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,919
let everybody brief so to everybody

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,440
watching along at home please do start

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
dropping your questions into the q

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
a session um we've got a few to start us

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
off but we will need input from you a

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,240
little bit later on

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,200
so shadipo i'm going to start by asking

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,640
are you abandoning node.js completely

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
and switching over to dino

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,000
so um so the thing is so dino is really

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,120
exciting i love dinner so much um but um

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,080
it's still um relatively uh i would say

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,279
relatively new

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,400
um and um i wouldn't want to um really

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
jump right into it

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
um i would want to use it to build like

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
release side projects

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
that's what i'm going to do i'm going to

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,080
be like a bunch of side projects and i

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,799
said that i think i said working with

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,600
you know

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,440
about um i think a month and a half ago

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
so what can we do you know and

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
i've been just basically building side

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,679
projects so i can see how it works and

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,320
how exactly i can apply this in

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
production

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,039
in a case that i would i wouldn't want

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,480
to like spend so much space i would just

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,279
want to like get things to compile like

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
immediately

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,480
um i will use you know but then i

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,480
wouldn't abandon node.js

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,440
for now for now no it's just a tinkering

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,559
thing i'd like to welcome eddie into the

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,600
q a eddie

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,080
welcome to this stuff i believe you're

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,320
taking over from here on out no that's

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,559
fine tony stay you know your questions

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,240
are

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,600
awesome and you stole my question that

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,159
was going to be my question i was going

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,840
to ask

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,320
that same one but what an awesome demo i

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
mean

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,840
you went through that really quickly and

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,679
it was it was brilliant

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,360
it was really good well done so fast

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
and we do have some questions from the

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,960
audience i have some questions lined up

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,840
so if we get time i'll ask mine but let

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
me let me grab

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,640
some from the audience all right so um

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,880
let's see

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,039
do you know plugins are there any for vs

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,600
code or webstorm

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,120
um yes they are yeah they have to know

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,120
plugins for ps4

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
um okay so i'm gonna get you the link

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,440
i'm just posting right now so

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,440
so this is the one i use

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,200
for one minute get you to plug in um

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,919
generally speaking is the plug-in

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,120
ecosystem good for dino

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,640
or is it that's still building up no

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,880
it's good it's supposed to be about you

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,400
know land oh nice

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
that's a really good question yeah good

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
answer too

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,520
it's true because a lot of the with a

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,400
lot of these things it's

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,480
immature so that's really good and i

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
understand dino 1.4 got released

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,960
yesterday

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,360
yes yes and that's so that's on the wp

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
so

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
you don't have to do anything like you

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,200
know how we work with the motors we have

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
to think something

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,720
so we gotta start updating node modules

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,559
like from our tummy now right

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
we know we don't have to do any of that

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,080
we don't do any of that

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,840
yeah so once once you like you get our

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,799
facial update everyone gets off shop

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,400
because it's being

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,919
like there's no dependencies we don't

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,120
have to install anything locally there's

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,559
none of that there's nothing like dino

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
modules there's nothing like that

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,080
it's all coming from a live url so once

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,279
it gets on updates

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,760
we all get an update that sounds really

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,760
scary

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,400
yeah but i'm sure there are some

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,919
positives as well i have a question on

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
that but we'll come to that shortly

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,159
um tony do you want to grab one from the

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,200
chat yeah sure

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,080
um so what are your opinions on the

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,039
unusual or

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
controversial approach to dependencies

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,400
over http

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,760
with dino um could you replace that

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
no because i don't really understand it

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,440
myself to be honest

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,799
[Laughter]

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,320
so i think it's the question is asking

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
kind of what you just said a second ago

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,159
about everything comes over http

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,360
i know we went through a phase quite a

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,240
few years ago where they would say oh

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,279
you can install

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,600
our library just run curl and it does

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,120
some magic and you know pipe it with php

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,799
or ruby or whatever

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,039
does some magic i think the question is

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,840
implying if all your dependencies are

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,520
gonna

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,080
um get updated over http

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
we don't we can't control what version

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,399
or what data is coming down

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
um so it's a bit unusual and

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,720
controversial

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,240
um so we cannot control um what um

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,240
version it is because it's coming from

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,799
http request so we can control that we

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
cannot

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
because um that's how we that's how

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,440
basically works unless you want to go to

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
the way of node.js by getting it down

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,720
and you can even downgrade using nodemon

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,000
so whatever versions you want that works

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
best for your projects

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,919
but in this case scenario um you can

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,320
control whatever um

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,760
whatever um version you are using you

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,440
can control that but um you should be

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,399
restlessly secured because number one is

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,679
open source

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,120
and you can always go to the code over

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,240
on github if you have any concerns

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,039
okay okay plus dino is well documented

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,399
that's another good part

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,880
now let's see okay the second question

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,919
we've had already um

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,360
the robotics one uh is not for you i

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,360
haven't got one at the top

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,600
i think i can can ever properly com

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,520
compete with node.js where no js has

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,640
such a head start

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,279
uh so um i wouldn't even call it a

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,799
computer

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
computation myself i wouldn't call it

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
and i'm not sure people should actually

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
call it

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,440
a competition i would i can put it you

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,360
can put it side by side that's you can

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,799
definitely do that but um

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
i wouldn't call it a competition i would

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,600
call this okay for example you know how

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,640
um people do things like um is reacts

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,960
better than view

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,919
is view better than angular um we all

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,440
hear these things and

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,360
you know so much accurate these things

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,760
that happen on twitter on the internet

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
because um it's it's not really so much

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,000
of a bug though it's really basically

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,880
what works for you

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,240
so um i can write react i can write view

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,159
back and right angular

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,159
but most stamps already react but there

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
are some products i'm like okay hey um

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,039
i think the view so i did something

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
really crazy recently and i want to

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,120
share it

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
so we know how um jquery automatically

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,840
like

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
we like to do like the dom itself that's

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,039
what jquery does and react doesn't do

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,840
that manually

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,720
so i was actually working with

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,960
javascript

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
rather i was working with reacts and i

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,799
added jquery in there

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
and we wrote everything and i did that

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,080
with reacts i did it with

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,360
angular i did a review that went

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
perfectly well so

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,039
it's not like i'm putting like it's side

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,240
by side but i'm just trying to see

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,960
at this point whatever what's that

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,960
beauty what is it

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,720
calm down yeah it's quite intense

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,720
so without like anything i'm building as

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,159
long as i know what i'm building um

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,080
i don't have to know what like what

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,520
exactly works so we even say

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,360
some people say they don't i don't want

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,120
to use webpack it's so hectic i can

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,200
configure i'm going to go for paseo like

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
congratulations that works for you so

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,960
please go there

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,240
and if that's what works so for dino and

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,200
node.js as long as

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,640
node.js works for you um use node.js but

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,600
if you want something lighter you want

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
something more secure

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,640
you're really concerned and working

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
probably is like a really huge project

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
and you say okay i want something more

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
secure than node.js i wanted that before

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,600
engineering have access to

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
um what i have locally before i can even

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,279
request what i want i can always um

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,640
like handle like whatever earthquake

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,960
like who exactly i'm giving permissions

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,200
to

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,279
i can always say uh whatever this is it

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,720
doesn't like as i put this

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,559
um even though like we're getting

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,799
automatic version updates once it's been

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,480
updated via url um

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,559
we see have access to uh a whole bunch

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,720
of things um how we work we can

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:08,000
okay oh i can share my screen or um

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,200
can i share my screen i can i don't know

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
if we'll have time for it though what do

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,919
you think tony

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,760
okay i'm just gonna got two minutes left

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,120
to this one okay

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,720
because everyone like put it out there

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,039
so it doesn't really confuse anyone so

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
um

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,320
i'm gonna copy something and i'm gonna

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,120
paste it

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,039
right here um in the chats how do i

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,159
paste in chat okay general chat

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,320
um but that's the arduino land url

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,640
that i used um when i was so i run

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,559
dinoland i allowed network access

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,799
and it basically gave me the content of

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,279
this url simply

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,039
um so whatever i am allowing i can

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,760
easily go to that url and see what

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,840
exactly

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,880
um i'm allowing into my code even though

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,559
it like um

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
like it's been automatically updated

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,120
somewhere else and it's not like locally

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,760
on my project

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,200
so you don't put dino on um you don't

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,320
say you know it's better than node knows

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,320
better than do you know it's basically

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,720
sure it's kind of the the right tool for

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,279
the job and also a personal preference

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,279
as well

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,760
um i i get that that that makes sense

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,200
so we've got um another question that's

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
come right to the top now i saw at the

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,440
bottom a second ago

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,919
i told you if you want to read the

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,799
second one down uh yeah sure

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,279
do you know anything about the dino open

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,279
source

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,799
governance or the open source governance

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,240
of dino has dino learn from the

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,440
experience of node.js

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,000
versus iojs for example and are they

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,640
creating

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,120
an inclusive community in the developer

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,120
community

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,720
yeah um yeah yeah so um

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,000
the creator of dino is um ryan um he was

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,840
one of people who found that

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,600
um he's actually the original creator of

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,799
node.js itself was one of the people who

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,200
created not just himself

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,039
so um yeah so since royal created

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,880
node.js um he's the official creator now

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,360
he has like tons of contributors all

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,200
around

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,640
um github because like that's open

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,679
source i'm someone who wants to focus on

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,480
open source i thought you'd be open

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,320
source a lot

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,600
about open source um i love

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,039
documentation open source

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,880
um recently i could give it i give a

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,519
talk at a conference about open source

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,120
design

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,960
and i said we always have documentation

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,320
for designers also not just developer we

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
should do that also it's super important

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,120
too

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,480
so um yeah since he founded open source

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,880
right uh node.js

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,640
like original creator he knew what he

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,440
did and he also found out okay i missed

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
certain things

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,039
so let's create a brand new technology

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,480
where the things i miss will be applied

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,760
here and um

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,519
so you just have to like choose which

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,000
works for you as simple as that

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,919
and the people who um are currently in

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,360
the committee of dino um yeah

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,519
i think yeah they're doing a great job

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,360
right now because um

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,799
i've not really seen any controversies

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,320
or do you know um i don't know anyone

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,600
else anyone i've seen but um dino has

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,200
really been doing great um

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,440
giving the community feedback and

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,559
answering responses about mostly

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,880
and mostly security they've been leaving

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,480
responses over twitter over github

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,840
issues and i track your great hobby

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,960
issues and i see all of that and they're

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,720
always responding

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,919
and yeah it looks like um yeah they're

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
building this healthy community out

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,840
there where people

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,279
can freely um like ask questions and are

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,519
not being um

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,799
uh called out funny names for action

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,879
starting questions okay so

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,320
at the time i asked a question on these

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
like i think like

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,240
four years ago i asked a question stuck

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
overflow i'm like hey i'm having this

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,639
like really bad problem

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,879
then someone is like hey dummy like this

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,240
is

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,079
something really simple why don't you

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,560
know i'm like because i'm learning

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
come on

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,200
exactly so it was really really like

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,800
really crazy but um

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,079
um over you know i always look for these

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,679
kind of things where i because the

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,480
community really i'm an advocate for the

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,760
community

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,879
that's why i moved to becoming a

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,079
developer from business software

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,359
engineer because i want to work with the

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,800
community i want to create a safe place

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,800
where people can ask questions people

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,320
can collaborate and talk and even find

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
business partners

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,159
or even something so yeah they're doing

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,359
a great job with community and open

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,280
source at the same time

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,520
and give them a little mini round of

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,320
applause for creating such an inclusive

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
and diverse

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,839
community certainly what i've been

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,280
hearing has been amazing

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,920
do you reckon we've got time for one

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,560
more ready i want to squeeze in my

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,560
question

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400
is that that's naughty yeah i'm abusing

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,160
the power but hopefully mine's a quick

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,760
question and quick answer we'll see

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,599
you said you keep saying no modules so

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
do i have to do i have to write

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,359
everything from scratch

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,599
what what happens if i want uh to do

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,839
something that isn't part of the core

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,839
um you know cordino

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,440
oh so you're gonna do something that's

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,400
not part of um the latino

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,040
but no yes has it what can i do okay

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,760
okay

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,280
so it would not be a very wise decision

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,839
to combine you know

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,119
and note in the same project that

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,440
wouldn't be a wise decision

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,560
and it because definitely whatever

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,839
you're doing dino

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,520
um you can do it with um node.js

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,960
it's just that like it's extra work and

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,400
like other things but

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,320
um if dino doesn't currently support

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,520
that i would say you fully go for nodejs

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,119
since it has

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
that but when do not suppose that you

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,400
can always come back to jail

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,920
and like rewrite and even gonna be

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,760
faster for you to even overwrite

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,119
so yeah i would say use node.js if you

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,160
know doesn't support you can combine

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,839
both of them

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,520
okay that's a a perfect place to end

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,920
there i think should ipo thank you very

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,240
much for your amazing talk the awesome q

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,839
a

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,520
um i'm sure you're probably going to be

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,680
dipping in and out of the event

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,760
the rest of it and people will be able

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,720
to people will be able to catch you on

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,000

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,079
okay that's my swear hand out here so

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
so i think i should cover my twitter so

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,800
hard

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,000
okay let me get you right there

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,680
i'll just give everybody a little

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
reminder to head around to all the

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,320
sponsor areas to get their secret codes

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,560
and to

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,440
