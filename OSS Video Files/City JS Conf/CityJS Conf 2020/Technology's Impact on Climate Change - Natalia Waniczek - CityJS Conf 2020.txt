Title: Technology's Impact on Climate Change - Natalia Waniczek - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	"Let's talk climate change and how technology is escalating it.

The Great Barrier Reef, Mount Everest, baby kangaroos, clumsy pandas... We have so much to be grateful for. The world around us is magnificent and power is in our hands to make sure that future generations will have as much, if not more, to be grateful for.

Unfortunately tech sector produces about 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, which is about 2% of the global CO2 emissions, the same amount as aviation. According to the UN we only have 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage from climate change.

You will walk out of this talking having learned what the current state of tech's impact on climate change is, and steps we can take to prevent this from escalating and reduce the carbon footprint."

speak here today

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
it's such a great conference i couldn't

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
be happier

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
many thanks to the organizers and

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,399
volunteers for putting this conference

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
together

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,920
you've done an amazing job i'm sure

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
everyone watching

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
as well as all our speakers really

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
appreciate your hard work

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
my name is natalia i'm an

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,360
environmentalist by night and

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
technologist by day

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
i build mobile apps and websites for

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,239
plymouth-based agency called elixir

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
and we're a digital transformation

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
agency that partners with their clients

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
to co-design

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,960
products and services that drive real

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,280
organizational change

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
if i'm not working i'm probably spoiling

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
my dog dobby

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,760
and trying to outlift everyone in the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
gym

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
or as of fairly recently um climbing all

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,119
bouldering

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
oh um and if i don't do any sort of any

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
form of fitness

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,439
i am likely to be eating cake because

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,079
it's called balance um normally when i

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,079
present at events um i get everyone to

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,560
do a little warm-up for the talk

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,360
10 air squats just to get the oxygen

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,330
flowing

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
you know get the blood pumping

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,200
[Music]

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,119
but as this is all digital um i trust

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
that you will all get up

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:54,079
and do 10 air squats um on your own

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,240
okay so is everyone ready

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
on

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,360
yay um that tender squad's done

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:09,119
well done that was so cheesy

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,920
um right so um why am i here today

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
um for some time now um i've been trying

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
to figure out

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
um what i can do to save this planet um

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
you know like probably many of you have

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
to be honest

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,640
um we all realize now more than

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,440
ever before how beautiful the world is

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,239
and how much it needs our work

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,959
our help to continue to grow about a

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
year and a half ago i had this epiphany

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
um that i surely am affecting

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,480
environment for the

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,480
for both the work that i do and the

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
technologies that i use

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
at the time i hadn't seen or heard of

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,400
anyone talk about

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,480
tech and climate so you know as you do

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,760
i went online and i asked twitter for

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,040
help

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,560
um that's actually how i um heard about

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
omg climate event um organized by

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,640
uh climate action tech uh community um

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,519
omg climate is a community-run

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,040
unconference

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,400
about technology and climate change

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,480
um the format of an unconference is that

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
attendees speech their ideas

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,800
the ideas and they're being voted for

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,920
and number with the ideas with

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,239
number and ideas with um

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
the most votes are then being discussed

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,799
in smaller groups so it's a bit

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
different than

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
your regular conference to which you go

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
to you know all your schedule ahead of a

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
time

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,879
and you attend the talks that um you

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,239
know what you're getting

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,200
it was an incredible event i learned so

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,879
much

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,560
i left feeling all inspired and

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,680
hyped and i decided that i can't

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,519
no longer sit around and but i felt

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,680
somewhat obligated um you know to take

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
all i've learned with me and and share

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
it with um

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,360
who'd like to listen um by all means i'm

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
i'm not an expert uh i'm here today to

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
share with you what i've learned

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
and so hopefully that will inspire you

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,319
to

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,319
um take your own steps to um

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,639
you know research the stuff and and

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,600
learn even more about it

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,320
um so today i'm going to talk to you a

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
little bit

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
about climate change uh i will show you

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
some stats

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,919
i'll show you some examples of current

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,960
state of climate change

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,199
how technology is affecting it

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,520
i also talk about principles of

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,280
sustainable software engineering

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,320
the ways we can reduce carbon footprint

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,199
as developers and in our day-to-day life

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
as you know people i'm going to run some

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
tests

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
and i'm going to show you examples of um

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,960
the work that's already happening in

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,560
this space

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,320
a lot of the things that i'm going to

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,759
talk to you about

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,479
today um are quite likely

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,039
um you know common knowledge for for

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,400
most

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,039
uh developers here um but i

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,600
think it's it's very very crucial to

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,639
highlight it as important for

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,720
sustainable and software

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
development that's why i will be

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
bringing it up

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,320
according to the ewen we only have 10

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,479
years left to prevent irreversible

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,919
damage from climate change

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,400
what it means is um if we don't act now

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,440
and by now i mean yesterday and global

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,800
temperatures rise

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,720
by 1.5 one and a half degrees

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
it will result in more dangerous

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
disruptions to global societies and

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,440
ecosystems

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,199
including longer hotter heat waves more

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,639
frequent crop killing clouds

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
as well as the increase of sea and ocean

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
temperatures

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,639
and those will of course impact and

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
worsen

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,680
storms and tornadoes the internet is

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,919
responsible for two percent

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
of global carbon emissions and to put

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
that in perspective

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,720
that's the same amount of emissions as

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
from aviation

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
by 2030 the internet is on track to

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,160
consume as much as 20

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
of world electricity and in adding in

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,160
other facts about climate

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,680
um 60 of wildlife has already been lost

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
since 1970.

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
over the past two decades nine sea

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
levels have risen by

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
3.2 millimeters per annum we're on

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,039
course

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,240
to lose um half of all insects by the

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,600
end of the century

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,160
and in 2019 greenland set new record for

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
ice loss

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,960
352 billion tons

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
the five years with the highest of the

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,759
biggest losses

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,360
have all occurred in the past decade

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,199
music streaming accounted for 200 to 350

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
million kilograms of greenhouse

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,400
emissions in 2015

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
and 16 in the us only i've done some

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,639
calculations

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,680
on um streaming spotify um

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,960
if you were to listen to an album

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,759
um if you were to listen for spotify and

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,479
doing it for eight hours for 21 working

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
days

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,400
it would emit as much co2 per month as

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,599
driving nearly 20 miles

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
by an average passenger vehicle if you

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
will

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
if you were to listen to an album 27

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
times in full

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,960
it's likely that manufacturing

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,639
and producing the same album would be

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
more environmentally friendly than

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,280
streaming it

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,039
um data centers

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,360
carbon intensive data centers most data

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
centers these days are still powered by

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
regular

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
fossil fuel energy they consume three

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
percent of global electricity supply

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,639
and account for two percent of um of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,639
total of greenhouse emissions

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,919
there's a study um it's focused on japan

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,400
and in this study it has suggested

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,520
that japan's data centers would consume

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
us

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,919
would consume its entire electricity

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,400
supply by 2030

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,759
if growth continues at today's rate

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,919
unless there will be a game-changing

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,680
break from data storage

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
there'll have to be different measures

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,039
put in place in order to stop the need

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,160
of more data storage

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,160
um some examples uh would include uh you

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560
know restrictions to the amount of

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,880
um of the internet use how can

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
developers save the world

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,080
um tech industry consumes as much as two

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,680
percent of co2 emissions right

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,279
and that is a lot of emissions um

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,600
as developers we all love new frameworks

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
uh we love fancy animations we love

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,360
going above and be beyond delivering the

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,120
fanciest looking websites we can

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,200
according to um http archive the average

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,720
the average web page uh in 2017 was

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,800
three megabytes

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,080
that is a huge increase from 1.6

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,920
megabyte average in 2014.

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,120
um and this is the latest day that i

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
have found um

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
so you know it does keep growing i

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,399
recently watched a talk

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
by asim hussein about sustainable

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
software engineering

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
and building carbon efficient

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,120
applications

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
in this talk he describes eight

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
principles of sustainable software

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
engineering

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
sustainable software engineering is a

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
discipline

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,640
at an intersection of climate science

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
software practicing software practices

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,120
and architecture

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,200
electricity markets hardware and data

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,360
center design

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
the principles i'm going to talk about

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
in a minute

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
are a set of core values that are needed

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
to define

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
build and run sustainable applications

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,959
all these employ

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
all these principles form a shared

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,079
understanding

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,519
of what it means to be sustainable

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,800
software engineer

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,079
independent of industry domain

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,000
application domain industry organization

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,519
size or type cloud vendor or

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
or self-hosted programming language or a

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
framework

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,480
um so what are the principles

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
of sustainable software engineering

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
first one is carbon

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,120
build applications that are carbon

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
efficient don't make any unnecessary

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
waste

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,560
second electricity build applications

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,760
that are energy efficient number three

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,240
carbon intensity consume electricity

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
with the lowest carbon intensity

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
be mindful of chrome jobs

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
embodied carbon build applications then

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
run

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,399
that run on all the hardware length and

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,839
lengthen the lifespan

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,040
of software and

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,079
energy proportionality run servers

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,959
at higher rate of utilization

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,560
networking reduce the amount of data and

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,680
distance it must travel across the

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
network

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
send smaller data sets don't request all

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
of the data

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,399
um in big chunks you know break them

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
down

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
demand shaping instead of shaping supply

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
to meet demand

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,040
try shaping demand too much supply

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,399
build carbon aware applications

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,279
measurement and optimization focus on

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,040
end-to-end optimization that increases

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,040
the overall carbon efficiency

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,120
what it stands out to me is that

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,600
[Music]

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,959
most of these principles are absolutely

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
required for building

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,240
for building resilient web we know that

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
we need to build up

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,160
build fully accessible fast

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,760
user-friendly applications we know that

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
the better we build them the more

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,880
traffic they're going to bet

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,279
and that's our goal isn't it so i feel

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,240
like

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,040
to the list of lot to the long list of

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,120
reasons

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:25,279
why we need to follow um good practices

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,920
we should also add sustainability

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
to expand on that a little bit i'm going

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,240
to

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,360
um to talk about some real life

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
examples tips if you like of things you

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,000
can do

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,040
to help reduce carbon footprint um

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,519
by minimizing um

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:51,440
what you do and by optimizing

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,560
your applications right clean html

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
you don't want to mess up the

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,399
foundations of your site

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,120
link your code for new scripts and css

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,040
use less scripts if you can avoid it

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,800
don't use jquery because

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,959
you know you probably don't need it um

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,360
see if there is a way of using css

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,800
animations instead of adding another js

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,920
library

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,880
avoid using ads um users

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
hate them they are so heavy on to

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,079
download as well

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,000
do you need to use background videos or

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,639
does your site really need automated

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
chat box

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
simplify and minify all of the scripts

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,800
and images

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:41,680
um lazy load previously optimized images

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,639
think about user experience the goal of

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,199
every site

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
is to make it as accessible and visually

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,120
pleasing for the users as possible don't

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
whack unnecessary junk bus just because

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,920
you have

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,519
some spare time or extra budget on the

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,680
project look back

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
and see if you can optimize it if you

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
don't need to

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,040
don't use twitter embeds or facebook

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,920
embeds or

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,519
anything link weights way links way only

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,600
links weigh nothing um and follow um

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,040
follow button on twitter weighs 50

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,120
kilobytes

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,959
so there's a huge difference well

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,639
huge or not so huge but there is a

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,600
difference um

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
and most importantly use green servers

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
uh

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
convince your project managers your

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,199
directors your clients

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,480
to pay just few quid extra to use green

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,199
servers

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,480
on that note a green web foundation has

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,199
huge directory categories by countries

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,240
where you can easily find green servers

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
you know

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
you've done a great job you build your

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,399
application but

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,040
how um how do you know if you've done a

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,680
good job

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,639
how do you know um if it's sustainable

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,440
if it's

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,800
um if it's if it's a good app there's a

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
bunch of

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,839
available services that can do audits

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,399
for you

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,639
and you could use lighthouse tools in

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,959
from devtools

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,839
it will give you a score and tips for

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,160
optimization it's it's really really

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,800
useful um

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,920
you could use website carbon calculator

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,720
to measure

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,399
uh carbon footprint of your site um it's

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
it's a really cool tool i'll show you

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,959
how to use it i

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,399
would highly recommend it um i've done a

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,160
couple of tests

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,279
a couple of audits on um city.js website

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,639
um i put it through carbon website

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,639
calculator

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,160
um and then i got the equivalence of the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,199
emitted co2

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,720
and you know human readable format

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,870
the first one and the fastest i've done

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,279
was in lighthouse um

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,759
[Music]

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,880
so i'm just going to focus on the

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
optimization

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,320
um on the performance um

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
on the performance test um so the

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,720
performance was

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,199
64. um

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
score 64 100 which is pretty good to be

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
honest

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,000
and the two opportunities that

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,440
could be done to to improve that score

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,839
would be to remove and use

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,320
javascript and eliminate render blocking

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,880
resources uh

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,639
so the next thing that i've done is i

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,839
put it through

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,600
um carbon website calculator

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,720
and cityjs website is cleaner than

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
82 percent of the web pages that are

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,199
being tested

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,880
it runs on green servers which is

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:48,079
amazing um and added in that

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,639
over a year with roughly 10 000 monthly

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,680
page visits

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,000
this webpage emits the amount of

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
carbon that two trees absorb in a year

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,160
which is um

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
quite interesting what i did next was i

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,039
got the download

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,079
size of the page well you know size of

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,760
the page

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,520
i put it through this calculator um

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,120
so the site the homepage was seven

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,480
um 4.7 megabytes

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:25,360
and that multiplied by

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,360
1 000 visits a month results in

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,080
5.729 kilos of

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,720
co2 emission co2 emitted per month

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
once i've done that i put it through the

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,160
equivalency calculator

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,320
and don't worry i've i've got all links

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,760
all those links and the resources in my

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
last slide i will

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,880
tweet the slides so you can um you can

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,600
have a look

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:56,080
um yes so the equivalency results

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,520
the 1000 visits to um

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,640
city dreas website per month

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:08,799
is the same equivalent um

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:11,120
it's got the same co2 emissions as 731

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
smartphones charged which is pretty

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,240
interesting

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,400
it has um the same greenhouse emissions

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:23,039
as 14.2 miles driven by an average

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
passenger vehicle it's all really

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
interesting and and i

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,280
really encourage everyone to look into

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
it and there are a lot of much smarter

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,400
people

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,559
who talk about technology's impact on

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,919
climate change sustainable development

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,280
green service

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
optimized optimization and and and all

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,480
that

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
i would recommend to follow chris adams

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
um

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,400
and previously mentioned asim hussein

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,039
they put a lot of interesting resources

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,720
out there

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,960
um they do a lot of talks um

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,000
really cool people to to follow if this

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
isn't this

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,160
interests you um other than that um

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,360
please download your music your podcast

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
your shows

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,360
wherever you know wherever you're

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,360
streaming them from

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,280
if you can don um use youtube to

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,679
if you listen to music but not watching

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,000
the videos and there is this interesting

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,480
study that shows that

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,360
youtube by only sending sound to users

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,280
would reduce their annual um carbon

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,480
footprint by the equivalent

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:34,320
of um 300 000

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,440
metric tons of carbon dioxide per year

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,720
which is you know which is a lot

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,240
check out uh prin principles of

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,620
sustainable

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
um software engineering and

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,919
[Music]

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,760
if you go to principals.green that's

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,039
where you can find everything

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,960
um if you're interested in and

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,760
and all that i would highly recommend

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,400
joining climate action tech community

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
um i would encourage everyone to

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
organize

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,120
uh 11 at 11. um it's this

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,640
initiative that encourages people to

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,600
take 11 minutes break

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
at 11 o'clock every friday and to talk

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,360
about

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,919
current state of um climate change and

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
the

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,880
environment if you go into climate

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,840
action.tech it'll take you here

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
if you're looking for green service um

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,120
green web foundation

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,280
is the place to go um the directory day

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,440
is always updated so it's

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,880
it's you know it's it's a good place to

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
go to right that's

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
the sample software engineering if you

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,440
want to measure your own carbon

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,760
footprint

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,320
um there is an app that's currently in

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,720
in beta called the north app

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,600
it automatically calculates your carbon

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
footprint

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,360
footprint by connecting to other

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
services

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,679
and apps um in your life and it

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,039
translates those activities

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,200
to greenhouse emissions if you use

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,960
firefox you could use

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,000
an add-on called carbonalizer

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,320
i hope i said it right it tracks your

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,280
um your traffic and then shows you how

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,480
much um

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,559
co2 you made for free browsing

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
it's worth having a look at some tech

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
giants and their approach to

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,640
sustainability

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,240
um amazon is very vocal about their

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,280
policies but

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,840
most of their servers still run on um

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,760
you know fossil fuel

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,880
powered energy um if that's something

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,240
that bothers you

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,320
as much as it bothers me

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
you can sign an open letter to amazon

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,280
requesting a change

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,440
i will um tweet a link to it and it's

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,919
also in the resources

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,760
google has a really good policy on

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,200
sustainability and environment

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,120
and actually all their services run on

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
renewable energy and that is very

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,360
impressive

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,600
the most um impressive is

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,080
uh microsoft they recently

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,080
well last year i believe announced that

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,280
they're going carbon negative

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,120
and will reduce more carbon um that

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,200
they have emitted in history as a

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,240
company um

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,360
they said and they will hit carbon

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,360
negativity by

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,320
2030 and have removed um

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,400
the equivalent of its timeline and

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
missions by

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,679
2050 and they're also putting a lot of

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,000
resources out there for developers and

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
and

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,559
techies and check out their blog it's

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,400
really um it's really interesting

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,480
i will tweet my slides and all the

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
recent resources i mentioned

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,799
are on the last slide um i will i'll

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,600
tweet that so you can have a look

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,640
um if anyone has any questions my dms

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,320
are opened

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,320
um happy to to talk about that

00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,640
um so yes we we do only have

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,679
10 years to prevent irreversible

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,000
irreversible damage from climate change

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,919
but hopefully during this talk you've

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,600
learned something new

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,039
something you can take home with you

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
something you can implement in your

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,440
day-to-day lives

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,200
or if you haven't learned anything um

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,360
i'm hoping maybe

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,200
you realize the importance of it all

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,200
you know little by little little becomes

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
a lot if we all do

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,640
small changes it will make a huge

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:37,840
difference

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:37,840
um so yes thank you

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:53,360
[Music]

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,080
hey natalia oh hi hi

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,840
um great talk thank you very much and

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
thank you for raising such uh

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,440
important points and questions uh for us

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,760
to all consider in our

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,039
in our daily daily lives i think it's

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,480
important to all of us

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,440
um and uh i mean i find it specifically

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
interesting

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,120
my background actually is as a

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
environmental and geographical

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,679
scientist as a great you know i

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,159
turned to web development because

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,279
technology life tech took that turn but

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,159
i've always uh

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,960
kept an interest in that i'm actually

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,640
starting

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,559
um an environmental science degree in

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
october oh fantastic

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
we're

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,360
where will you be studying that um with

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,679
open university

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,880
fantastic fantastic yes it took me a

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,080
long time

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
yeah i mean the the in the when i did my

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
degree

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,679
i mean the climate crisis wasn't quite

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,600
as um

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,360
acute as it is now but there was

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,799
awareness and it was feeling that

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,559
you know we had to go paperless and

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,120
going digital was the way to go

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,640
but i think you know the truth and which

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,679
you're kind of revealing through your

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,240
through your uh you know your talk and

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
you know

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
this sort of activism around uh

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,240
knowledge around

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,159
um the impact that we do have actually

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,799
data center the cloud isn't a cloud

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
it's a bunch of

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:20,320
that is the servers isn't it okay and i

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,279
i know you did say your um

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,799
all your uh resources and links because

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
there was so much information in that

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,039
talk

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,320
and so many things to follow and so many

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,760
articles to read

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,279
it'd be really great if you make sure

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,159
you tweet that out and just let's make

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,840
sure people can get

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,279
hold of that because it feels like this

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
is something we all need to get into our

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,720
daily lives

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,880
um i have tweeted it during

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,240
my slides tweeted during the talk so it

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
should all be um

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,400
available out there but if anyone needs

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
any more if i missed

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
on something then um you know feel free

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
to ask

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,760
well some questions are coming in

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,720
through the board here so um

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,919
if you're ready let me uh it's such an

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,520
interesting topic i think there's so

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,960
many angles you can take on it

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,360
um so michael uh has said awesome talk

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,360
natalia what's your view on the rise of

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,679
ai and its need for computing power

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,960
resulting in vast power consumption

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,039
creating heat with an urge with an

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,440
urgent need of cooling

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,080
um that is a great question sorry my dog

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
is coming into

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,679
hello dobby um um here's a great

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,880
question

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,880
and i think um

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:36,320
it's not an easy one um i think

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,080
um we need to be really mindful of how

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,600
like how are we powering all the

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,679
resources right

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:48,159
um and because we we will be using

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,240
a lot of energy to to both um

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,000
you know run all the the processes and

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,880
then to call them

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,840
um but yeah um i think it all comes down

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,159
to

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,159
um

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,039
renewables really okay so your source of

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,840
energy is what you're saying

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,520
is yeah i mean we've all been fed the

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,880
line that technology will save us and

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,360
now technology is sort of

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,640
you know we need to find a way to bring

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,240
awareness of what you're saying the

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
resources that technology use

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
and how how what the full life cycle of

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,080
that is um

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,919
another question is you had a list of

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,080
items uh

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,919
to not do on your website i'm curious

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
about specifically having those items on

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,240
your website

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,080
contributes more to climate change about

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,720
having those what oh i see

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,880
is that like well so so basically the

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,279
the reason why i pointed those out it's

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,200
really

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,320
like um those are just the little things

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,600
that can

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,080
minimize um the download of the

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,120
um of the of the web page um and and

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,880
that's what i'm

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,120
what i meant that's why i listed those

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,080
out so um i don't know putting chat

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,159
boxes

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,760
or um extra long carousels

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,679
videos things like that that aren't

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,240
optimized um

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,279
that is an issue i believe it's

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,039
interesting because

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
i mean the challenge is always to get an

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,960
audience and to try and maximize and get

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,799
as many as much traffic as possible

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,080
but at the same time you're wanting to

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,080
minimize

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,240
people's use of the resources to get

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,960
that traffic so i suppose it's like you

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
know

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
in you know 20 years ago we had to

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
optimize everything

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,159
out of every pixel and we should still

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,360
be doing that rather than relying on

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,440
broadband to to deliver

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,600
and it's very it's very closely tied

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,520
with um accessibility really if you

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,360
build your site fully accessible

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,640
um then you won't have this much

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,000
of an impact on it as well so it's there

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,279
is so many things there are so many

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,480
angles you can look at it

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,520
so so accessibility and all those good

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,039
practices

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,640
that we should be doing for the user's

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,000
sake anyway can actually

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
have a better effect is that what you're

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,039
saying on on

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,799
the the carbon footprint of our website

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,720
and that is yeah i believe

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,000
believe so yeah okay interesting

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
interesting

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,840
um do you know which of the larger

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,520
front-end frameworks generates the least

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
co2 i mean

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,159
is this something that's been done has

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,760
anyone rated react versus

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,840
um oh i can't remember it is a great

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,159
question tony

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,200
um i

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,880
i saw um i saw someone do a little

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,640
um research into the but i can't

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,360
remember sorry um

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,880
but i'll look into it i'll look into it

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,480
i mean it'd be interesting to compare

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,880
because you know you have your

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,559
this move with things like svelte.js to

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,279
sort of pre-compiled

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,279
you know web native uh technologies

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,600
versus those that ship the framework

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,200
along with everything that goes along

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,399
with the delivery of the page and maybe

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,320
there's something in sort of an

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,520
optimization step there

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,039
um that's fascinating um

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
yeah keep the questions coming in people

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,679
because i think this is very this is

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,200
very interesting topic what can people

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
do i mean you did mention

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,240
you know joining a local climate action

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,760
group or something i mean

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,080
what can we do in our daily lives

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,720
day-to-day i mean working remotely as we

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,840
do

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,679
to sort of be effective not only in our

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,919
sort of technical implementation but

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:26,080
how can we get more people aware of this

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:31,360
and change the thinking of

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,679
managers and clients and product owners

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,000
oh i think i think talking to to

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,880
managers product owners we need to put

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,399
um as sad as there is really but we're

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,679
going to have to

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,720
talk about business uh benefits like how

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,279
how um environment and sustainability

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,000
such a big topic for everyone out there

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,120
um and

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,120
i as as bad as it is from like

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,320
from my perspective looking at it

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,320
because i'm looking at from a very

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
edited

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,320
you know building things more

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:21,600
sustainably will break

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,840
like working at the um

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,399
sides of our lives i believe like if we

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,880
can all just switch to like

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,640
i don't know octopus or another like

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,080
renewable energy

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,080
that'll be good um

00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,069
[Music]

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,080
turn off the tv when you leave

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,760
that okay

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,360
so so there's a change in lifestyle

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,679
which is uh

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,799
probably going to be forced upon us like

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,640
the same way

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,799
uh remote working has been forced upon

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,799
us

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,039
maybe um is there something that you

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,240
know since this sort of epiphany that

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,159
you've had around

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,519
the you know the impact of your your

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,840
professional life on

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,679
on the climate that you've changed in

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,519
your life generally not necessarily tech

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,320
related this is a question from tony is

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,240
there something you've

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,919
you've changed or eliminated from your

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,559
life for environmental reasons that you

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,640
miss

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,559
now um vlogs actually i've been

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,840
um i've been a vegetarian for a few

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,080
years now

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,919
um i why maybe not that many

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,440
actually i tried i try not to buy

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,200
food that's being shipped you know

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:43,840
across the world

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:43,840
okay i like vet from log

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,880
like not trying not to get um you know

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,000
not to get into fast fashion

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,960
that's another thing um trying not to

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
upgrade my phone every time like a new

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
version

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
is um

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,519
because no he doesn't

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,880
think

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,000
where do you think the uk stands in

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,320
terms of the uk tech scene in terms of

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,200
renewable using renewable resources and

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
websites

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,399
are we ahead or behind the rest of the

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,600
world

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,240
uh i'm not sure how we stand against

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,159
the rest of the world but um i've heard

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,000
a lot of people actually

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,799
say that they are using um bring um you

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,440
know green

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,000
um green servers so i believe that's a

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,320
good thing

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,120
i think the biggest problem is that the

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,480
um

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,880
you know aws you know

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,360
um corporations that are running that

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,159
we're using their servers and their

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,559
um services that those are still still

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,399
run

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,519
on um you know coal powered

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,960
energy which is really really really bad

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,320
i don't you know it's it's

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,560
um it's a it's it's also

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,639
i tweeted that's why i talked about that

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,560
open letter to amazon because

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,159
you know changes need to be we can do

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,240
all the little things and we can make a

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,800
little difference but if if the big

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,839
policies aren't going to

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,079
go the difference then you know that

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,440
it's going to be a problem

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,720
um you you had a lot of statistics

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,440
