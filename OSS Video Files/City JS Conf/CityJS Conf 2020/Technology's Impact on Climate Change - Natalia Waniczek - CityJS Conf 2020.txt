Title: Technology's Impact on Climate Change - Natalia Waniczek - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	"Let's talk climate change and how technology is escalating it.

The Great Barrier Reef, Mount Everest, baby kangaroos, clumsy pandas... We have so much to be grateful for. The world around us is magnificent and power is in our hands to make sure that future generations will have as much, if not more, to be grateful for.

Unfortunately tech sector produces about 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, which is about 2% of the global CO2 emissions, the same amount as aviation. According to the UN we only have 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage from climate change.

You will walk out of this talking having learned what the current state of tech's impact on climate change is, and steps we can take to prevent this from escalating and reduce the carbon footprint."
