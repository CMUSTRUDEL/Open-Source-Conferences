Title: Little JavaScript Bundles of Joy - Sophie Koonin - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	"Backend microservices are so hot right now, but it's still the norm for web apps to be big JavaScript monoliths. Problem is, the more people you have contributing, and the more code you add, the slower the build and deployment process becomes.

Find out how we tackled this problem at Monzo using independently deployed and dynamically loaded JavaScript modules for our React-based customer support application. I'll share the motivations behind the project, the options we considered, the difficulties we had along the way - and how developer experience has more of an impact on customer experience than you might think."
