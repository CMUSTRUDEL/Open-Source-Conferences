Title: Front-end Testing on Steroids - Stefano Magni - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	Writing tests is like using GIT: as soon as you gain a bit of experience you wonder how you could work before discovering it.

Why testing a front-end application is so hard? What are the main challenges you need to face? Why do the tests fail without a clear reason?
If you have ever wanted to test your front-end app, if you ever tried to test it, if you have ever hated a bunch of UI tests and removed them from your pipelines... Well, this talk is for you ðŸ™Œ

I am going to show the challenges coming from automating user flows, checking everything worthwhile for the end-user, creating an ally that prevents you to add regressions, and why Cypress is an amazing tool for these purposes.

Cypress enforces you to respect a lot of testing best practices, guarantees a good developer experience, and allow you to forget a lot of bad testing habits.
And if you feel you are not ready for writing tests yet... I am going to show you what are the Cypress' features that could improve your everyday productivity, something you always care about ðŸ˜Š.
