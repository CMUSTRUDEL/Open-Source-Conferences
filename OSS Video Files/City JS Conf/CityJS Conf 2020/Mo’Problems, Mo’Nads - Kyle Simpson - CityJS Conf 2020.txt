[Music]

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,439
hello and welcome

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
i'm kyle simpson but most of you know me

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
as getify i'm director of web futures

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,199
for my own company which means i get to

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,719
spend my time focusing on

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,239
envisioning the future of the web and

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
then helping empower other people to

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
achieve it

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
to that end i've recently partnered with

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
kudota who also makes the tab 9 plugin

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
for your favorite editors

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
and they have this machine learning

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,440
model that helps the tool make semantic

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,440
suggestions

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,039
to help you as a developer do your jobs

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
better super excited about this

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,680
symbiosis between developers and smarter

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,719
tools

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,320
so stay tuned for more in that space

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,920
some of you may know some of the books

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,680
that i've written but you may not have

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
heard of this book the functional light

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
javascript book

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
i encourage you to check it out because

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
there's an appendix about today's topic

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,000
and yes i know this word monad is kind

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
of scary but in these brief few minutes

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,240
that we have together i hope that you'll

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
stick with us because i think there's a

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,840
lot to uncover

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
some of you heard this quote before and

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,119
you may have wondered like where does

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
this come from or you may have heard

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,119
inserted other words besides regular

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
expression into this quote

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
but i think it's an apt description of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
kind of the fear that we sometimes have

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,799
of are we using

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
the right tools in the right way now

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
it's entirely fair that some of you may

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,560
feel that

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,799
this is exactly what i'm about to do

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
with monads i understand i get it

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
but i hope that you'll keep an open mind

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
because the truth is that regular

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,960
expressions kind of get a bad

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,119
rap i mean yes regular expressions can

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,360
be abused like for example parsing

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,520
all possible html that you ever may run

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,720
across that's entirely not the right

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,840
kind of thing to do with regular

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
expressions

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
on the other hand there are tools that

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
can do jobs very effectively

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
if your job is to do one specific thing

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
like parse one

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
specific string of html a regular

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,159
expression can absolutely be

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
that right tool speaking of that adage

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,000
the right tool for the right job there's

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
also using the right tool in the right

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
way if i have a hammer in my hand and

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
the task is to put a nail in the wall

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,920
and i swing it with my hand everything

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
works fine but if i use that same hammer

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
and put it in my mouth and try to swing

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
it

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
we're not going to get the same good

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
result so you have to use the right tool

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
for the right job

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,879
in the right way and the same is true of

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,879
regular expressions and i argue

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,360
the same is true of monads we have to

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,519
select the right tools for these jobs

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
see not all tasks are appropriate for

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,080
all tools so

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
if we're talking about that generalized

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
task versus a more specialized one

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
and i think that's what we'll see out of

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
monads in our discussion today

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
so how are we going to approach this

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
topic of monads

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,319
well we could start with a very formal

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,720
statement of the type

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
theory using some type and haskell-ish

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
syntax

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
and i don't know about you but that

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
looks very greek to me so it doesn't

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,000
very much

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,080
speak to me so i think we won't go that

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
route now others of you may have taken

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
a different approach and read blog posts

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
where you've heard monads described as

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,159
burritos or onions or other sorts of

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,920
silly metaphors my own favorite personal

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,840
metaphor is the rubik's cube

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,120
because the rubik's cube basically has

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
these different sides

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
you don't have to study every single

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,560
side all at once

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
you can look at just one side and that's

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,519
what we're doing in our brief time

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,159
together today we're looking at one

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
specific

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,519
aspect of monads but to answer that very

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
prescient question that is in your mind

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,480
right now that pressing question of

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
what is a monad well let me give you an

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
example of an answer to that maybe not

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,239
the only an authoritative answer but one

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
side of that ruby's cube so we could say

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
that it's a set of rules for how one

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,720
collection of values and behaviors

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,959
can interact with another collection of

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,560
values and or behaviors

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
so if we squint it at that we could sort

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
of call that a data structure

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,920
even though i know that's going to upset

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
a bunch of people because technically

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
it's supposed to be called an algebraic

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,879
structure

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,239
ultimately i find this question of what

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
kind of a distraction

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,319
because it's focused on the identity

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,519
from like a type description is very

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
academic

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,439
and and that description doesn't really

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,159
speak to what we want to be talking

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,319
about

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,200
so i think that there's a better way of

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,120
looking at this

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720
instead of the what question i really

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
want us to look at one specific side of

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
the cube

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,199
which is more like the why question i

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,960
used some big

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
and confusing words just a moment ago

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
and i don't know about you but i didn't

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,759
even know there was more than one

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,240
algebra that's a plural noun

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,240
this is like toto i've got a feeling

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
we're not in kansas anymore

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,919
but instead of being distracted by that

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,160
what question of its identity

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,840
i think this why question is more useful

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
so this talk will focus on building an

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
intuition

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
about the why question what can we do

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
with these things in our code

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,759
and why does that even matter now as

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,440
soon as i dive into a talk on this topic

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,880
out of the woodwork where there will be

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,240
waves of the well

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,759
actually kind of description of oh i

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
didn't get this exactly right or didn't

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
use

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
exactly the precise word we're

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,039
deliberately being informal here

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
we're deliberately trying to be

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,160
intuitive rather than academic about it

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
and i understand why the communities

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
especially functional programming

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
maybe more so than others they want to

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
protect the things that are so easy to

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
misunderstand

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,479
so i get it but it sometimes comes

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
across like the functional programming

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,120
police who are saying

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
you know there's only one right way to

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,440
do this and i reject that statement

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,039
there's not only one right way we're

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
going to look at just one

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
of the facets one of the sides of this

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
rubik's cube

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,479
and we will shun some of that more

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
formal terminology and theory in favor

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
of

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
what can i do with an encode and why

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
would that be useful to me

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,479
so boiling this very complex space of

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
category theory and types and all of

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
that down

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,960
to just two concepts that maybe we can

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
hang on to

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
we're going to take all of the ideas of

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
interfaces and types and we're just

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
going to put it in this one word type

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,759
and then we're going to take all of the

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,960
ideas about what we do in our programs

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
the things that we interact with and

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
we're just going to call those values

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
and so we'll look at a comparison

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,759
between explaining a subject as a type

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,520
or explaining a subject as a value so

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,960
give you an example the number type

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,039
tells us that there are these things

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
that we can do mathematic operations on

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,880
and they tell you specifically what we

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,080
can predict after we do those mathematic

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,319
operations

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,240
but if i don't have a specific concrete

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
value i can't actually do math

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
i need the number 42 so that i can add

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,479
or subtract

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
from that value in javascript as in some

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
other languages

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
quite frankly these lines are quite

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
blurred there's not a very strong

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
distinction between types and values in

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
a language like this

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,240
there is some but not nearly as much as

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
in other languages

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
and so we kind of mix and match these

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
ideas together

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
and and if we were to tease them apart i

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,280
would say that types are focusing more

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,360
on that what question

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,479
whereas values and that's what we want

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
to focus on because they're going to

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,080
focus

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,880
more on that why question

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
so the values are behaviors that we can

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
use

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
where the types are the behaviors that

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,919
we can expect

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
so what does that monad thing mean well

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
i want to

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,479
frame it this way i want to talk about

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
the monad

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,360
versus a monad v monad being sort of

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
this proper noun thing described by type

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
and category theory

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
and a monad being this thing that can be

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,759
in our code

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,319
so we have the monad versus a monon

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
now v monad tells us some very important

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,360
things some formal things like the three

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,199
laws for example

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,120
the left identity the right identity and

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,280
the associative law they tell us things

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,840
about what we can expect out of

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,560
any sort of monadic value that we might

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,759
run across

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
in a program but it's the data structure

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,479
itself it's the value itself in our

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
program

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,160
that we are going to actually interact

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
with so where the law might tell us that

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
we can do

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
something like a chain operation it's

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
the actual value that may have a method

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
called chain

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,800
or flat map or bind that we can use in

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
our programs and speaking of these

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
values and their behaviors we can

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
actually mix and match values and

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
behaviors together this is one of my

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,160
favorite things because we get more

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
powerful

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
monads out of doing that we get things

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,039
like the maybe the either and the i o

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
and those are

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,800
monads that we'll see here in just a

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,520
little bit so i think we should look at

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
some code

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,879
to try to make this a little bit more

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
concrete this is an example using a

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
library that i wrote which is called

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
moneo

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
and i'm not trying to sell you on the

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,000
library i'm just using it as a concrete

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
way to illustrate in our code

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
here with moneo we have this thing

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
called just it's just a function

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
you see on line one i call it and i pass

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,680
in the value three

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,479
and what i get back is this monad

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,640
wrapper

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,880
this monatic wrapper around the value

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,959
three i can inspect it i can check to

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,640
see if something is of that type

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,080
now as a word of warning you don't

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
typically see the

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,959
just as its own standalone monad it's

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
usually part of this bigger monad

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
that i referred to just a moment ago

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,399
called the maybe that maybe is usually a

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
pairing of a just or a nothing

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,240
and so you don't see it usually called

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
out but in the mineo library i made it

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
its own specific monad it's kind of

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
serving the purpose of what we call

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
the identity monad meaning it just holds

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,040
a value and then lets that value

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
come right back out to be used in other

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,200
operations

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
so that's an example of using a monad in

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
code

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
now there's lots more behavior that we

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,720
want to uncover from that

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
but if you can get comfortable with this

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
idea that we could take a value like

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
3 and wrap it in a magnetic value the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
next most important question you'll

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,200
wonder is

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,040
why would i do that why is that

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,279
important and that's what we'll spend

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,480
the rest of this talk focusing on

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,800
so to illustrate the monad but using

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
actual concrete code here's those three

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,399
laws that i just referred to

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,560
actually illustrated in code we see the

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
left identity law the right identity law

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
and the associativity law

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
now i want to call out that while we see

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,839
the actual usage

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
of things like the chain method on line

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,880
three

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
you see that being used that's just a

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,040
representation of what the types

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
and the category theory tells us a

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
monadic value needs to be able to do

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
it doesn't have to be called chain and

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
indeed you often

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,440
see it called bind flat map other things

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
like that

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
so this code is not proving all of the

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
monadic theory all of the laws

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,240
but rather for a specific implementation

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,560
like the one in my library

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
and for a specific value like the value

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
three and for a specific

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
set of functional behaviors here like

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,200
the f and the g functions line 11 and 12

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
it's just saying that for that specific

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
scenario

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,240
we can see the laws being played out we

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,680
can see that these two sides are equal

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
and that's what the laws tell us that we

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,680
should be able to predict

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
now code like this is not good enough if

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
your goal is to be like a mathematician

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
or a theorist

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,600
but it's absolutely good enough to start

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
getting our feet wet

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
with actual code and all we need to take

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680
from this

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,040
is that these things if we have a lawful

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
implementation of a monad

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
they're going to give us predictable

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,640
behaviors we won't necessarily use these

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
direct behaviors very often

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,800
but we'll use lots of other things that

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,440
build on these behaviors

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,040
so speaking of these other sorts of

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
behaviors that we can mix and i referred

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,959
to that just a moment ago

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,320
i like to call this monads and friends

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,760
right it's like a group of

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,839
kids that have gathered together in the

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
sandbox to play together they have lots

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
of different

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,399
kinds of identities there's lots of

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,560
different things so we can say these

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,399
other behaviors like semi-group and

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,240
foldable and applicative those have

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,800
these fancy names and they are very

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,279
distinct entities within that bigger

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
category theory space but i really like

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,079
to just refer to them as friends of

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,560
monads because in my

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,279
experience i often see them illustrated

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
together

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,959
implemented together on values and i

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,920
think that that makes them all more

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,920
powerful when

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
they come together so in my perspective

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,079
we'll be illustrating these

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,640
as all together under this one sandbox

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,640
that we'll call monads and friends

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
now i wanted to give you a quick example

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,160
of using a monad and i'm going to get

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,639
into more examples in just a moment but

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
just

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
so that we're not dealing only with this

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,480
abstract idea of that just you remember

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
i referred to this maybe monad well here

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
i'm using the

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
maybe monad and i'm actually invoking

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
another behavior that's been mixed in

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,839
this is called the foldable behavior

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
because the maybe has these two sides

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
it's either holding onto a value or it's

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,200
holding on

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,279
to a nothing and this foldable says

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,399
let's select one of those two based upon

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,000
what's inside it

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
let's select one of those two and call

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,320
one of these callbacks so if the nothing

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
is what's inside of it like a null or an

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
undefined

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,959
then we're going to invoke the callback

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,880
from line five but if a value like a

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
string or a cost in this case

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
is there then we're going to invoke the

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
callback from line six

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,240
that's all that foldable is saying is

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
based on the identity of what's inside

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
of you

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
call one of these two callbacks and give

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,880
us the result back

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,079
so this is an example of using a maybe

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,639
monad encode and we're going to come

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,360
back to that

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
in just a moment but i want to motivate

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
the rest of our discussion together by

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,399
asking this most important question

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,480
i've already referred to it a couple of

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
times why monads

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,600
well the answer to that question is

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,440
simply as i can state it is

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,120
that they're a tool just like anything

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
else like regular expressions or any

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,360
other thing we use in code

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,959
you find a problem you find the right

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
tool you use the tool

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,320
in the right prescribed way and you

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
solve the problem

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
now monads just happen to model and

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
solve problems differently

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839
than you're used to but that actually

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,200
opens up a whole world of other

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
additional possibilities

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
and that's what gets me so excited now

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,920
by the way when i show you these sorts

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,320
of examples

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,079
i want you to be careful about jumping

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
to the conclusion oh that's not more

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
readable that's more confusing

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,760
of course that's going to be true

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,680
because anything that is

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,760
less familiar to us is automatically

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
going to be less readable to us

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,360
so the first time that you see these

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,839
sorts of examples they're less familiar

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,399
and therefore less readable but if you

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,760
push

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
your boundaries a little bit if you

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,480
practice with them and you try them

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,720
then the unfamiliar becomes familiar the

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
unreadable and under

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,040
understandable becomes readable and

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
understandable

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,560
so this will be a journey this is not an

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,880
aha i get it all of a sudden

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
in just 20 minutes together in a talk

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,600
but i hope that it wets your appetite

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,199
that you want to dig in more and

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
practice with these things

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,639
so what are some things that we struggle

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,639
with in our programs what are some

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,880
questions that we might ask of our

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,639
programs what problems might we face

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
and i'll say that these are all problems

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
that all of us have faced in all our

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
programs

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,279
and we've also already got lots of

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,040
familiar solutions to these problems

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,120
we're just looking at another way of

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
solving them that opens up the door to

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
potentially

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
better usages of these patterns in our

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
code

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,240
so we may choose a value or a fallback

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,320
value that's a very common task

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
how do i do that we may want to

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
gracefully handle an exception

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
maybe one that was unexpected or one

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
that was expected

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,279
and we also might want to wrangle all of

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,199
the crazy maybe asynchronous i o

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,279
side effects that are happening in our

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
programs these are all very common tasks

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,000
but

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,760
there's an infinite list of other ones

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,279
these are only a few that i chose to

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,680
call out in this talk

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,399
so let's start with that first one how

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,880
does

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,519
the maybe allow us to choose a value or

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,279
a fallback this is just one way of using

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,399
our maybe monac so to describe it as i

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,160
said a little bit ago

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
we have this thing called a maybe which

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,160
is really just under the covers

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,560
holding something that is either an

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,360
affirmative value like the number 42

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,519
the number three a string or it's

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
basically representing a nothing

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,199
meaning like a null or an undefined in a

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,519
language like javascript

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,480
so we use this tool this helper that

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,279
comes along with

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
the maybe function and it's called from

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,079
and under the covers the from is

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
essentially doing an if statement it's

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
saying

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,240
if this thing is null or undefined then

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
we're going to represent it as this may

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
be nothing

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,839
and if it's a value anything else like

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,480
the number 42 we'll represent it as a

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
just

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
you remember i said that we don't

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
typically see the just or the nothing

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
standalone

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,440
they're usually part of this parent

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,120
monad called maybe

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
it's just that in manila's case it was

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
also convenient to have them

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,959
be able to be used separately if you

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
wanted to but we're using maybe here and

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,399
we're saying maybe.from

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,079
and that gives us a maybe just you can

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
see that that's how it's inspected there

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,800
in lines two

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,880
and lines three we can inspect it and

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,279
see that it's holding a maybe just

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,720
wrapped around that value 42. the same

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,560
thing when i pass in a

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
dot from null like on line 6 we're

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
getting a maybe nothing out of that

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,320
now i want to call out that on line 8

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,480
i'm not using the maybe from that's

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
the maybe unit constructor and here

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,399
there is no selection logic it's not

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
saying null or not null or anything like

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
that

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,959
it's just simply taking whatever you

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,800
pass and wrapping it in another monad

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,160
so in this case we would take the empty

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,079
the maybe nothing

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
and wrap it in a maybe just and that's

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,920
what you see illustrated on line eight

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,519
maybe is kind of this it's referred to

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
as like a sum type because it

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,320
can either be a just or a nothing

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,160
depending on the conditions of how it

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,560
was constructed and that's what the from

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,639
helper is letting us do

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,000
so let's take a more real world-ish kind

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
of example this is

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
from some actual code that i've been

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
working on it's like a media app it

00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,360
doesn't really matter what it does but

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
here you can see

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,399
that i'm wanting to select out a value

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,959
and do some matching and

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
aha i'm using a regular expression see

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
because i have this string it's coming

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,199
from a drop down of various mime types

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,039
and i want to match like video audio or

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
image from those mime types and if

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,640
that's there i want to match that out

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
and if not i want to fall back like i'm

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,120
doing on line three i want to fall

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
back to just this quote web value so i'm

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,400
selecting out a value from a regular

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,880
expression and if there's a failed match

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,959
there

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559
just select the default value now you

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
probably recognize code like this you

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,200
may have done it with the ternaries you

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
may have done it with if statements but

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
it's a very common

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
thing to try an operation and substitute

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
a default value

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,960
if we don't succeed so that's exactly

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,960
what's happening here

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
and this solution quite frankly is

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,280
familiar to all of us and works

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,960
but we would classify this solution as a

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,720
bit more imperative

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
and what we're looking for in functional

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
programming is to look for ways to solve

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
those problems

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,320
in ways that compose better with other

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
solutions this is kind of like a metal

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,640
level here because it's not just about

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
this problem

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,240
but about other problems i'll solve

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
alongside this in the code

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,520
and if i do the solutions in the right

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
way they will pair together

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,880
much more effectively than imperative

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,880
code typically does

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,320
so that not equals null check there we

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
can actually model

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,080
using the maybe dot from you see that

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
they're on line three i'm using this

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,000
maybe.from

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,320
to model that selection logic of did i

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,440
get

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,720
a value out that was an actual match

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,960
from the regular expression

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,960
or was it null and i dropped that into

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
this thing called a maybe and then again

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
here

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,880
using the foldable nature i select out

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
either

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,120
a function that will return me back my

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,520
default value or this identity function

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
which

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,960
the identity function just returns

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,440
whatever's in it whatever is passed to

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,679
it so

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,280
we just either select out a default

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,240
value or select out the value that we've

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,799
now selected

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
so we're allowing the maybe monad to do

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,600
that selection logic through the from

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
utility

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,640
for us and to hold on to that nature of

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
is it a just

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,360
value or is it a nothing in isolation

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,600
that doesn't look particularly exciting

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,960
maybe a slightly more complex example

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,000
might help to motivate it a little bit

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
more

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,600
here i'm doing some nested ternary logic

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,799
which could be exactly like some if

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
statements that you've written

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,120
i'm just saving space on the slides but

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
i'm not only doing that not equals null

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,440
check like on line two

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
but i'm also doing a an operation on a

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
value

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
if we found a value here i'm shortening

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,240
a string i'm

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
putting a dot ellipsis on the end of a

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
string if it's too long

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,840
so it's kind of an operation where i'm

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
mapping it to some other value if i need

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,919
to

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
just conditionally of course but mapping

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,200
it if i need to so

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
we could do this very imperatively the

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
way that we're doing we can either

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,640
select the value or a default and if we

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
select the value then we can also apply

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,679
some additional logic

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,280
but this is where we get to start

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,640
bringing in more of these functional

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,200
behaviors more of these

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799
magnetics and friends behaviors so here

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
what we're going to do is again use the

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
maybe

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,039
we do the maybe from there that you see

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
on line two and what we're going to do

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,679
is call the dot map on the result of

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,520
that and the dot map call by the way

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,039
is another nature that we get kind of

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,919
directly from the core

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,120
of of monads because that comes to us

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,600
from the functor

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
nature of monads they allow us to map

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
over things

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
and if that sounds a little bit scary

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
you've actually probably seen this a lot

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,039
when

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,120
you've dealt with arrays in your

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,000
programs and you've done a dot map on an

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
array call and it

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
executes a function against all the

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,799
values in that array and gives you a new

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
array back

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,120
that is exactly the same concept here

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,320
there's only one value to be mapped over

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,880
but what we're saying is

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,000
if i have a maybe just i want to invoke

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,840
this map method

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,840
to do something on top of it and that's

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,440
the selection logic to decide

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
if i need to truncate the string with an

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
ellipsis or not now the cool part about

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,840
this

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,440
map call that's happening on line three

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,480
is that if under the covers that

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,559
maybe.from had produced a nothing value

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,400
then the map call that comes right after

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
it is just a do nothing

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
it doesn't do anything when there's a

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
maybe nothing involved it's only invoked

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,080
to do something useful if there's a

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,480
maybe just so we would skip over line

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
three

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,960
in the null case in the nothing case and

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
then just go directly to line six and

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,480
again you see the foldable nature there

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,039
that's how we select out either our

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
fallback value or the value that has now

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,799
been

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,200
uh terminated with the dot dot ellipsis

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,360
on the end of it

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,120
so here's another example using the

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
maybe in a slightly different way

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,480
this is selecting properties and this is

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
maybe one of the more common examples

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
that you see with maybe

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,440
it's selecting properties on a nested

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,600
object reference like we have

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,000
entry.media.source.url

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
and if at any point in that chain a

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
property is missing

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,799
if we're just using the dot operator

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,600
then it might fail which is why

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,440
recently some of you know about the

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,280
optional chaining operator that question

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
mark dot that you see there on line nine

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,400
this optional chaining operator just

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,320
sort of short circuits out

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
and doesn't do anything else if it runs

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,840
across a missing property

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
so a lot of people are really excited

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
about this feature i think it's a great

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
feature to be added to the language

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
but i wanted to show you how we can do

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,480
this same kind of thing this

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,840
optional chaining thing using something

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
like maybe this is a very common

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,880
illustration

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,640
of that use case same object here we

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,360
have the entry the media the source and

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,799
the url

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,840
but you'll notice that i'm dropping it

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,240
into maybe from and i'm using this uh

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,640
this

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,159
chain method again because maybe it's a

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
monad we're going to be able to chain

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
from one

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,120
monad to another monad instance and that

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
prop function if you'll notice there

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,320
it's giving us back another maybe every

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,080
time so at

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,919
each step we're checking to see if the

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,679
thing that we pulled out was null or

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,919
undefined if it was empty in some way

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
and if so we switch to a maybe nothing

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,440
which effectively short circuits the

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,120
rest of those dot chain calls

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
you probably recognize something like

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,760
that short circuiting from promises for

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,679
example

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,520
if you have a bunch of vends on it and

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
you get an exception or rejection and a

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,679
promise

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,039
it just skips over all of those and then

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
goes to the end wherever your catch

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,600
handler is

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
it's the same kind of thing here so this

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
safe property access

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
just kind of short circuits out to a

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,640
maybe nothing if any one of those

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,640
property accesses fails

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
that's why on lines 10 through 15 it

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,760
succeeds but on line 17-21

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
we've exited out early if you will and

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
all the rest of the chain calls are

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,200
effectively ignored

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,799
so yet another example of being able to

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
put this selection logic

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,960
into the representation of our value

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,840
using a utility like maybe from

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,799
it puts that selection logic in so that

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,640
we're sure

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,840
that this value is going to behave in a

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
very

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,320
predictable way now i want to call out

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,120
this undefined versus this maybe nothing

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,159
the line 13 versus line 22 here because

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
what i'm going to say is that even

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,559
though these are both

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,039
empty values in a generic sense

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,440
actually these are not the same because

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,440
they maybe nothing is far more powerful

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,200
than just an undefined value and maybe

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,480
nothing even though it doesn't seem like

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,240
it's doing much

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
it's a magnetic value and it gives us

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,080
lots of predictability in terms of how

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
it will interact in the rest of our

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
program

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,159
where the undefined you have to special

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,159
case with if statements all the time

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,840
and so that's why one of those reasons

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,039
why moving towards this monadic

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,919
representation

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,640
can open up the possibility for us to do

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,480
more things

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,960
and do things better in our programs

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
so the second question that we wanted to

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,679
jump

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,960
to is how do i gracefully handle

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,559
exceptions again

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
exceptions that either i know are going

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,200
to happen or exceptions that were

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,720
unexpected

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
but i still want to gracefully handle

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,360
them we're going to use what's called

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
the either monum for that

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,360
and by the way the either monad is very

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,080
similar to the maybe monad

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,600
they're both these sort of sum types and

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,960
in the examples i'm giving here you

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
could sort of interchange them you could

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,159
have used the either

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
for what i just described maybe doing

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
and you could technically do what we're

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,640
doing here with a maybe

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,400
but it's a little bit more convenient

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,600
this way i think so that's how i chose

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
to illustrate it

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,159
the either is a pairing a monad that it

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,039
will select either an

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,880
either right or on either left now on

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,679
either left is usually reserved to

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,840
represent like

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
the exception or the error message

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
whereas the either right

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
is designed to represent like an

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
affirmative value that still has

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
uh operations and behavior that we want

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,360
to do so we could wrap up the

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,919
result of any operation in an either

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
left or

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,679
either right and then it that because

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,120
that is monadic then yet

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,720
exactly the same kind of benefits we

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,559
just illustrated with the maybe

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
that it will have a predictable behavior

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,520
it'll have short-circuiting

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,279
all of those sorts of things so you

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,679
notice here i can construct either dot

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,760
left

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,159
on line one either dot right on line

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,279
five and by the way the either and the

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,279
maybe since they

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,000
in this implementation they're both

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,679
implementing the foldable interface

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,520
that so-called semi-group here because

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,559
of that we can actually take a maybe

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,720
that's a foldable

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,200
and consume it into an either using this

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,320
from foldable interface

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
so you would typically do a an exception

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,440
handling using tri-catch it's the most

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,919
common way that people do this in their

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,360
code

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
now the try catch there's nothing wrong

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,440
with it but it does

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
get very hairy to compose lots of nested

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,400
tri catches

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,240
as you go throughout all of your

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
programs and you have lots of layers

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,279
deep of the call stack

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,799
and things so what we would like to do

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,559
is actually have a slightly better way

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,360
of wrangling these exceptions

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,360
and that's what we're going to

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,159
illustrate with the either now i'm going

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,679
to use this

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,200
helper that i'm going to define called

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,120
safe here and you'll notice that

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,200
basically what safe does is it tries to

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,679
call a function and if that succeeds

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
it puts the result in either right and

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
if it fails it puts that

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
result into an either left so it's very

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,039
similar to the maybe from it's just

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,000
doing that selection logic for us which

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,279
kind of either

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,200
do i need and if we use that safe as a

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,919
wrapper around for example the json

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,720
parse

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,799
line 8 we can call parse json we can

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,279
parse some json and if that fails in any

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,799
way

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
we know we're going to get back out and

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,880
either left which is going to short

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,559
circuit

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,159
so the next dot chain call it will just

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
be skipped line nine

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,919
but if it succeeds if we're able to

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,080
successfully parse the json

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,840
then we'll get back out and either right

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,400
and then the chain call there on line

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
nine

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
will invoke the next step in this

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,760
process which in this case

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,039
is our safe wrapper around the save to

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,520
db function

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,360
so we would only call that save to db if

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,279
the parsing of the json worked

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,039
otherwise we would skip over it and

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,960
again you see the foldable here is kind

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,720
of a convenient way of illustrating

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
how at the end of all these magnetic

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,159
operations how do i reduce that to

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
something that i can actually look at

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,240
like alert an error message

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,120
or grab that value and put it in the dom

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
or something like that

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
so fold is just one of the various

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,480
convenient ways that we can

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,240
at the end kind of get that value out we

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,559
select either the either

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,679
left case that calls our error function

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,200
with our alert error

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,080
or the either right would have invoked

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,159
in this case the identity function

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,440
so how are we going to manage side

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,880
effects that's our last

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
question that we want to ask and this is

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,399
the most complex of all of them

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,399
i'm using what's called the i o monad

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,159
here now the i o monad is a special kind

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,320
of monad that wraps up not just

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,760
number values like the number 42 but

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,600
actually functions

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,799
functions that can produce values like

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,960
the number 42. so

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,799
line one you see an i o wrapping around

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,120
in this case an arrow function

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,200
that returns the number 42. it can wrap

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,720
around any pure function so

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,720
it doesn't have to be ones that return

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
constant values like you see here

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
but what's special about it is that it

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,640
turns those functions into what we call

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
lazy

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
meaning that we can compose all of these

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,760
functions together for example we see a

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,159
hello function

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,080
a hello i o monad wrapped around a

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,760
console.log statement for hello

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,919
we see this i o wrapping around the

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,559
console log of world to make that world

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,200
i o

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,159
and then we compose those two on lines

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,679
nine and ten

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
but you'll notice that in all of these

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
cases like lines two three and ten

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
none of that is getting invoked until we

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,919
call dot run so we can compose these

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,080
things we can compose all of these

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,720
complex side effects in our application

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,279
but none of them actually are affected

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
none of them

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
actually are executed to change the

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,960
state of our app

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,480
until we call the dot run that makes it

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
a lot easier to pull these things from

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,279
all different places

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,200
and then have a nice predictable

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,480
ordering so the io monad the more

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
complex our apps get

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,520
the more it starts to shine in terms of

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
helping us wrangle

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,720
all of these side effects by the way

00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,279
lots of side effects that we could

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
consider

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,279
things like console log are very simple

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
but like saving to the database writing

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,159
to the dom

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,520
even asynchrony all of these are things

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,720
that are side effects that

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,279
something like the iomona can help tame

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,399
so let's take a look at an example uh

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,159
again from that code

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,720
base that i was talking about here i've

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,480
got some an array called entries

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
lines one through four i've got an array

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,679
called entries and i have these side

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,520
effecting functions lines

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,679
six and ten the first and the second

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,399
functions are pulling values out one at

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
a time

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,520
and that's changing the state of that

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,799
array so these are side effects if you

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,760
will they're changing the state of this

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,039
global variable

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,120
and then i'm doing a console log

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,760
statement on line 17 again another side

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,600
effect

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,760
now all of that side effecting is

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
composed in this one function

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,279
playlist but it's done we did so very

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
manually and imperatively

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,399
and then we invoke the playlist function

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,640
on line 20.

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,480
so that works but the more complex our

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
apps get being able to pull these things

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,880
together into

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,159
bigger and bigger functions and make

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
sure that things happen in the right

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,399
order

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
especially when asynchrony comes into

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,919
play that gets really difficult

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,600
so here's where the i o monad could

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
solve this in a different way

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,559
we're going to have that same global

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
array but we're going to wrap every

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,440
function that's doing these side effects

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
in an i o monad

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,039
so we have this i o that's right called

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
first that's wrapped around the

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,840
modification to pull off the first

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
element from the list and then we have

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
another one called second to pull off

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,360
another element from the list and then

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,360
you'll notice lines 11 through

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,919
15 14 that we're basically doing the

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,679
composition of all those ios together

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,240
and we're calling this special function

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,840
called concat now that's delegating to

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
this other thing

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,200
this compatible behavior i think i said

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,720
a moment ago that

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
fold was the summit group it's actually

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,200
concat that's a semi group so sorry for

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,399
that

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,360
concat here is the semi group and that

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,640
is what defers or delegates down to the

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
underlying values

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,640
if there's some concatenation to occur

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,799
so concatenation might be something like

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,039
two strings being concatenated together

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,120
or it might be uh two numbers being

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,039
added together any sort of intuitive

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,039
lower level value being concatenated

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,480
together in this case since our ios are

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,159
producing strings we're able to

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,080
concatenate those things together

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,480
just like we were doing before and then

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,640
the final line 14 that chain

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,679
takes the result of those concatenated

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,799
the i o that's holding those

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
concatenated values

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,519
and actually logs out that value so

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
again what we're doing is able to move

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,360
from a more

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,120
imperative spaghetti-ish kind of mixture

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,159
of all this code into one nice

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,960
clean listing uh very um

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,279
you know very straightforward listing of

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,799
what

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
each of the operations are that we want

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,640
to perform

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,480
now i want to talk about some specific

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
things with moneo's io as i begin to

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,760
wrap up this talk

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
we have what's called this do syntax

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,559
that comes to us from haskell

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,480
and you'll notice that it's represented

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
here in javascript we appropriate that

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,640
idea

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,799
we do something here in javascript

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,519
called this generator with the yield

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,279
keyword

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,039
so what we're doing is basically getting

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,600
a kind of compromise

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,720
between the very manatic chainable style

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,440
that's traditional and functional

00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
programming

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,640
and something that looks a little more

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,320
familiar to you this kind of looks a

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
little bit like a single weight style

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,880
programming

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,559
under the covers the yield keyword is

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
calling our chain method and chaining

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,240
our ios together

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,320
so it still performs magnetically and

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,399
gives us all the guarantees and

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,720
expected behaviors that we want but the

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,679
it nods to a slightly more familiar

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,320
and accept easy to accept coding style

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
and so that's

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,399
one of the advantages of this do syntax

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,279
and that is something that the

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,960
the the implementation in the neo of the

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,640
i o monad supports

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
and this is a more complex example i

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,399
don't want you to get too wrapped up in

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
the

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,120
usage of these maybes and eithers and

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,880
things but i want you to focus

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,799
specifically on line 63

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,200
because here i'm doing something again

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,440
that looks very much like a async await

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,440
style this weight function is actually

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
creating a monad wrapped around

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,720
an asynchronous timer it's kind of

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,720
faking that there's a

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,720
like a delay of a lookup in the database

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,600
and so there's an asynchronous timer

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,519
that's going off

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,440
and that resolves that monad and then

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,720
moves along and the reason i wanted to

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,519
illustrate this is because

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,279
moneo's i o is actually a transparent

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
transformer over promises

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,320
which kind of makes it like the task

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,799
monad so

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,000
it lets us do this async await style

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,080
either in the do syntax

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,559
like we see here or in the chaining

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,399
syntax that we saw earlier

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,480
and that's what i'm kind of excited

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,080
about with this io monad this concept

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,799
because you can mix so many other things

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,799
into it

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,799
like the task behaviors and reader and

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,559
all these other monad behaviors into it

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,720
so along with all of the friends in the

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,799
manila library it becomes kind of this

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
one size fits all or the one ring to

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,240
rule them all kind of moan at

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,760
and i've started to use this in a lot of

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,120
more places in my program

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,600
and that's what's got me excited and

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,480
wanted to talk to give you this talk

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,799
today

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,760
so as we wrap up let me just give you a

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,320
quick summary

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,519
we talked about this monad type and

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,360
interface idea

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,679
and that tells us that we can make these

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,279
values that have these sort of abstract

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,600
guarantees about what their behavior

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,600
should be but the real focus that we've

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,720
spent in this talk is on what can i do

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,480
in my programs like

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
what problems do i face and how can i

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,320
solve those problems

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,159
so i hope that you have gotten that this

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
is not an all or nothing thing you don't

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
have to be

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,040
all functional you can sprinkle in

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,079
little bits of functional like pure

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,159
functions and

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,919
use a maybe monad and then maybe using

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,679
an either moana at a later time

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,079
you can progressively move through that

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
and that's kind of the takeaway from

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,839
my functional light javascript book and

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,560
the associated course from fronted

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,240
masters

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,599
is to just go through this little by

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,320
little instead of feeling like you have

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,240
to rewrite

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,480
the entire program again you want to

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,359
develop some intuition and familiarity

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,359
with these things

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,520
so that they become more readable and my

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,000
caution to you is don't be so scared

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,079
about

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,599
the confusion of it that you run away

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,159
because then you'll never get to that

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,280
point

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,839
where it feels more understandable so

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,919
i hope that maybe i've convinced you to

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,800
try out moan ads and and try to explore

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,480
them a little bit more

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
there's lots of great resources on that

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,760
topic oh and by the way you should

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,520
probably also use regular expressions

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,839
thanks very much for coming to my talk

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,839
mo problems monads i'm kyle simpson

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,570
getify

00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,570
[Music]

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,800
kyle has arrived the man the myth the

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,920
legend that is

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,160
hello hello hello that was a brilliant

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
talk thank you very much for giving it

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,079
thank you and to everybody watching

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,480
along please do pop your questions into

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,680
the q

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,200
a section um i can't see any in there at

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,359
the moment so i'm gonna

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
ask you kyle if you could tell us a

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,000
little bit more about your amazing book

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,040
that everybody

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,320
is in with a chance of winning today yes

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,960
um we uh we gave away

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
the or are giving away the get started

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
book so

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,160
many people probably know about the

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,560
first edition of the you don't know js

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,920
books those were written starting back

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,400
in the end of 2014 and into 2015

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,000
um and there was always a plan to come

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,599
back and update those books

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,280
unfortunately it took a lot longer than

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,320
i expected so

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,359
um the beginning of this year i finally

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,839
picked up that work

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,880
and started putting out the next edition

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,400
of those books

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
because it turns out a lot has changed

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,000
about javascript but also a lot has

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,040
changed in terms of what i know about

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,520
the language

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,119
i know more of it than i did before and

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,760
so i wanted to update that

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,440
so as things currently stand two of the

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,480
six books have been rewritten for the

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,839
second edition

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
it turned out they were a complete

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,320
rewrite from scratch i totally started

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
over with

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,000
empty files and those two are out the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,400
first one is called get started

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,599
and the second one is the familiar scope

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,560
enclosures book

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,920
so all the attendees we've got the get

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,240
started book

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,160
the first in the second edition books

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,520
the rewrite

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,839
wow you all have been very busy

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,599
that's a lot of writing it is a lot of

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,119
writing for sure

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,400
and so i can't see any questions of

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,160
coming just yet i'm sure people are

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,480
furiously typing as we speak

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,760
but um before i put everybody to sleep

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,560
one of the two i'm not sure what

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,440
it is one or two i'm sure it was the uh

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,680
the former

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,520
and so i'm from cornwall and your

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,800
workshop that you did down here many

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,040
many years ago now

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,440
it's all remember that famous locally

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,599
really yeah we keep on getting

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,280
so i used to work for the organization

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,040
that brought you down

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
and we keep on getting asked for you to

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,920
come back so do you fancy a trip it's

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,400
cornwall for holiday

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
i would love to come to cornwall it was

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,200
such a beautiful area i've been to

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,720
london like

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,520
a million times right i've been to

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,440
england i actually in college studied at

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,640
oxford for a summer so i was in that

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,880
area for a while

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,079
but i had never actually seen like the

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
really pretty parts

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,000
of the uk of england before and that's

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
where i got to see

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
we came out to cornwall and then after

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,119
that we went up

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,880
kind of a little bit further up the

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
coast and stayed at this like hotel that

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,400
overlooked the

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,560
ocean and it's just a beautiful part of

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,640
the of the world of the country so

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,720
yeah uh anytime we get a chance to make

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,800
something like that happen again i

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,320
one of the cool parts of my at least

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,560
former life where i was traveling all

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,839
the time i don't travel much now but

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,920
when i was traveling all the time it's

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,680
getting to see these beautiful areas and

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,599
and cornwall is definitely high up on my

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,920
list it was beautiful

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,920
awesome well i'll pass it on to the team

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,920
and so when we when we look at your your

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,640
talk

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,599
is it safe to say that you do functional

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,760
programming more than

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,400
object orientated programming or is it

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,880
very much a mix for yourself

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,800
i would say it's definitely a mix i

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,280
don't i don't do a lot of what i would

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
call

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,200
object oriented programming because

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,920
typically when you

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,160
hear that term you think classes and i'm

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,920
actually not a big fan of writing class

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,839
oriented code

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,400
so i wouldn't do a lot of what you would

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,680
traditionally call say from the java or

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,800
the c-plus plus

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,119
tradition of what we would call

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,920
object-oriented

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,800
but i do work a lot with objects which

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,599
in sort of a more broad sense is

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,960
object-oriented it's just without

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,839
classes

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,920
so i use a lot of uh very basic

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,880
architecture the module pattern and

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,880
objects as name spaces and i even use

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,800
what i call object delegation which is

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,040
leveraging the the prototype chain in

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,240
javascript and things of that nature

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,760
so sort of generally speaking i

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,359
i do object oriented the functional uh

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,440
aspects of my program are a relatively

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,760
recent addition to my programming

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
toolbox and by recent i would say

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,760
over the last three to four years i've

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,960
started to try to understand this space

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,560
and that's one thing i'd like to

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,280
emphasize for anybody that's listening

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
in is that

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,359
this was not an overnight thing it's not

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
like i read some book or i watched the

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,800
conference talk or read a blog and then

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,160
all of a sudden the light bulb went off

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,200
it's been a long

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,160
uh adjustment process and even to this

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,400
day i've been

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,000
actually writing an app where you saw in

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,520
the talks some code snippets from

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,480
a real app that i've been writing for

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,560
myself and i start out writing

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,680
code imperatively because that's still

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,680
my comfort zone

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,920
it's still what i've done for 20 plus

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,920
years and so i start out writing it that

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,000
way and what i have been able to

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,359
accomplish over the last several years

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,119
is be able to look at a

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,119
piece of code and then sort of neo

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,800
in the matrix style be able to see

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,119
beyond that to

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,640
the pattern the pattern behind what i'm

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,440
doing and that's when

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,040
what can emerge is the alternate option

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
doing something with functional

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,599
what i know about functional programming

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,480
is that it offers many more guarantees

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,280
it offers better testability you know

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,680
more

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
more readability even though people

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,040
listening maybe think oh

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,680
that looked much less readable once you

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,440
actually get used to that style of code

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,760
those things actually jump out more

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,280
quickly at you than you typically would

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,520
with imperative code you don't have to

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,599
do as much mental execution

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,839
so all of these are things that i know

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,839
to expect from functional programming

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,839
it's still difficult for me frankly to

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,920
author a program from scratch

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,920
using those techniques but i've gotten

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,440
better at the case of writing something

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,800
and then as i'm getting along and

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,520
understanding a little bit of what i'm

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
doing

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,079
kind of micro refactoring to use these

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,160
principles little bit at a time

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,240
so i would say that i'm i'm in the in

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,839
the most truest sense of the word a

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,760
multi-paradigm programmer

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,000
which means for any given line or any

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,079
given set of lines of code

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,359
i'm going to use whatever pattern is

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,440
most comfortable whatever

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,280
pattern makes most sense and ultimately

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
whatever pattern will communicate

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,280
best the ideas that i want to get across

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,200
what's happening for me over the last

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
several years is that that's starting to

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,000
be more functional in nature

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,640
but it isn't it isn't even yet the thing

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,800
where that's

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,040
automatic that's it's still a thing that

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,440
i have to work towards

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,560
okay so the questions have started

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,319
rolling in now

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,560
okay we can move on to them so we've got

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,960
one here saying many of the patterns you

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,319
showed

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,800
look familiar is there a benefit

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,920
to being more conscious of when i'm

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,760
using a monad

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,119
like pattern yes i think that's actually

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,119
uh this is a great

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,079
question to start off um our q a with

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,119
that's that's really the core essence of

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,520
this talk

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,800
is for you to begin to realize that all

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,520
of programming

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,680
is recognizing a problem and then trying

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,359
to substitute in a known solution or

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,240
work out a solution

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,160
to that known problem all programmers

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,240
regardless of what paradigm you use

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,000
follow that practice they look at

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,400
something they want to do they try to do

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,319
it they run against it's not doing what

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,359
i want that's the problem

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,599
and then they solve that problem using

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,359
what they have already seen before

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
or what they can google or stack

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,800
overflow they use

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,560
those solutions to solve the problem

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,079
that's the general pattern that all

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,720
software development follows

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,400
and so all i'm suggesting here is that

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,960
there's this set of tools

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,400
that solve problems in a different way

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,319
than what we're used to

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,440
and i include myself in that because i

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,680
didn't start

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,640
programming in the functional tradition

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,640
uh but the

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,640
they're all problems that we all face

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,480
and i only called out three there's

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,560
literally an infinite list of problems

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,400
that we face functional programming

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,440
offers what i think is some really

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,680
compelling

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,480
alternative ways of modeling the

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,720
solution

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,599
and one of the biggest reasons why we

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,920
want to do that

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,440
is as i said it can produce more

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,480
readable code it will produce more

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,599
testable

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,720
and more uh verifiable code like for

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,240
example

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,960
you could you could literally get to the

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
point where you could know for sure

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,960
because it's based on math even if you

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,200
don't know the math it's based on math

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,000
and you could know for sure that a piece

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,079
of code will have

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
a certain outcome even if you haven't

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
run the test suite

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,280
and i just imagine to myself what if i

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,000
could have that level of confidence in

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,079
my code

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,359
that before i even run the test i know

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,720
exactly what it's going to do i know

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,440
what's going to succeed what's going to

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,240
fail

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,160
that's the the offered principle here

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,119
but i think even more than all of those

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,079
benefits

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,839
is that the functional way of thinking

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,680
about our programs to create these tiny

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,720
pieces that compose more cleanly

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,480
together

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,920
what that offers is that once you have

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,800
gotten familiar with those different

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,119
pieces

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,400
those are lego pieces that fit together

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,160
much more cleanly

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,680
than any imperative code we've ever

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,359
written so i don't know about

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,440
people listening but i've always felt

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,400
like man i'm having to fight against my

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,560
program the more

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,160
imperative and the more if statements

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,079
and the more try catches i have to

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,160
wrap around things it gets harder and

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,240
harder to wrangle through the code

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,240
if you're doing functional programming

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,440
the right way and i admit that it takes

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
a while to get there but if you're doing

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,880
it the right way

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,400
the further you get into a program the

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,400
easier things get

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,880
because things start to fit together the

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,599
way lego pieces are designed to do so

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
so it's really training ourselves to

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,200
move from that more comfortable but

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,880
harder to maintain style of code to a

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,880
less comfortable initially

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,480
but much more easy to maintain and

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,640
verify style of code down

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,680
down the road that's what i hope that

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,200
you get from this talk

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,200
that's what you want to look for those

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,119
problems and then say ah

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,880
i remember that there's a tool that

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,319
looks like that just like if you were

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,160
building a home and you're like i need

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,680
to put a nail in the wall i remember

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,240
that the right tool for that is the

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,640
hammer

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,240
that's what we want to get from this you

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,800
say that i nailed in a hammer with a

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,800
drill today

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,960
hammered in a nail with a drill you know

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,640
sometimes you got it sometimes you got

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,000
to use whatever tool you have available

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,079
to you but ideally

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,160
we want to use the hammer yeah

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,839
definitely and that does lead nicely

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,760
onto another question we've had come in

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,000
when would you choose functional

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,000
programming over any other paradigm

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,480
eg rxjs versus monads

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,599
so it's not an either or it's not

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,839
mutually exclusive rxjs is actually

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,960
in a lot of ways very compatible with

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,880
functional programming

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,280
as a matter of fact in the functional

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,440
light book i talked about in my talk

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,319
which you can get out on on my github to

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,800
the same way you get

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,680
can get the other books in that book i

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,520
have a whole chapter

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,680
talking about applying functional

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,440
principles over time

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,599
and the way we do that is basically

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,079
through observables which is what rx is

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,240
so rx is actually very compatible with

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,240
the way of thinking about functional i

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,920
don't use observables an awful lot

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,480
myself personally but that doesn't mean

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,079
that

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,760
it's it's an either or that you have to

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,880
pick one or the other

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,960
the thing to recognize is that when

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,319
you want to use functional programming

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,800
is when it is

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,599
ever the case that you have a piece of

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,720
code

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,400
that you want to be isolated from any

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,079
other piece of code in other words

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,280
if you're on line 5000 of your program

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,960
and it is an impure function call and it

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,720
references who knows what else from

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,760
other parts of the program to know what

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,760
line 5000

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,000
is doing requires you to mentally

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:10,079
execute lines one through lines 4999

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,040
to compute the state of the program in

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,960
your head

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,119
so that you can understand and predict

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,800
the outcome of line 5000

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,240
and i don't know about you but i'm not

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,480
particularly good at

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,839
executing javascript in my head that's

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,920
what the computer is good at

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,040
so functional programming offers the

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,160
promise of

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,720
what if line 5000 could be computed

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,240
completely in isolation of anything else

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,280
would that make you a more effective

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,359
programmer

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,160
so i hope i don't sound too glib when i

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,960
say there's almost no code that can't

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,480
benefit

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,359
from that some pieces of code benefit

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,440
better from low level simple things like

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,520
simply making it a pure function call

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,280
some bits of code will benefit from

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,640
using something a bit more exotic and

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,880
involved like a monad

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,400
and some will benefit from patterns that

00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,880
quite frankly i don't even understand

00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,640
yet

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,480
there's a whole road that i'm still

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,920
headed down trying to learn

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,440
but i don't think there's any code where

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,960
you could say oh you definitely

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,680
shouldn't do that functionally

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,559
even side effects which seem the

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,319
antithesis

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,960
of functional programming can be

00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,960
wrangled better if you use the iomo net

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,000
so if you'd asked me this question say

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,599
two years ago

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,680
i probably would have answered it by

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,040
saying well you know anytime i'm going

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,960
to do side effects like

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,240
managing the dom for example i'm

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,280
probably not going to worry too much

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,880
about functional

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,480
and now when you ask me that question

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,200
i'm going to say if i need to do side

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,520
effects

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,599
i now understand that there's a tool

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,319
that's actually well designed for that

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
problem

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,000
and that tool is the iomona so it is

00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,720
always the case that you will be able to

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,240
learn

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,920
a pattern you may not recognize them

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,680
always off the bat

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,520
but you will be able to learn a pattern

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,960
if you apply yourself to try this you'll

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,359
be able to learn a pattern

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,720
that should be able to address basically

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,680
anything that you run across i don't

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,359
think there's

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,119
very many tasks that you would ever do

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,240
in programming where somebody would say

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,000
definitely not never do functional there

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,960
is often the case the opposite

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
where there's a very dogmatic like it

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,880
has to be all

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,880
functional or none and i don't like that

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,240
that dogmatic perspective either

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,920
you can have one line of code that

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,599
benefits from functional programming

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,359
and another line of code that you don't

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,480
have the right tool for or it's not

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,559
appropriate for

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,640
and that's okay because i ultimately

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
want you to have the pragmatic balanced

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,000
approach to your code

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,440
that lets you communicate better and

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,280
lets you ship code

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,720
i don't want you to be stuck in the mud

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,599
if you will like oh i can't do it

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,520
perfectly so

00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,160
you know don't let perfect be the enemy

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,280
of good pragmatically decide on every

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,720
line of code

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,240
is there something that i know is their

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,800
tool that i know that could make this

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,040
line of code communicate my ideas better

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,079
be more verifiable be more testable be

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,079
more independent

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,760
and if so use the tool and if not don't

00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,680
use the tool

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,880
yeah and i think breaking down your code

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,960
into line by line

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,040
like that and looking at it is a very

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,520
good exercise particularly for

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,520
people who are maybe around the junior

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,559
level or even below

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,160
and get get input on it as well yeah

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,040
absolutely we need to be able to look at

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,200
our programs

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,359
and ask questions of our programs

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,960
instead of just like oh it works and i

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,720
don't know why and i'm not curious

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,200
we should ask questions of our program

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,480
hey why does that do what it's doing

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:22,240
and how do i make it do that even better

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,240
okay so we're running out of time so if

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,359
i could keep you short on this one

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,359
okay and then hopefully we'll have a

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:30,400
little bit longer one afterwards um

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,400
will native js support monads and other

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,720
structures one day

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,680
do you think um i think it's very

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,960
unlikely

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,200
that native javascript ever grows

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,960
more than the syntactic capabilities

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,240
that it already has so we have functions

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,720
we have closure

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,480
and if you adhere to the principles that

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,079
functional programming requires

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,839
you can do everything that you want to

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,480
do in functional programming that's a

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,079
somewhat

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,000
controversial claim because a lot of

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,520
people would say no no javascript is a

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,440
terrible language to do that in

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,359
i happen to think that javascript native

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,559
core javascript is actually one of the

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,520
best languages

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,079
to express functional principles in in

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,160
part

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,440
in large part because javascript is not

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,640
constrained

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,440
by the same complexities of type based

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,880
languages

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,200
so i actually think rather than being a

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,440
weakness that's a strength of javascript

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,960
in this space that is a controversial

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,040
statement but it's my position

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,200
on it so i do think that native

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,920
javascript already supports the things

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,760
that we want

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,520
and then we simply bring in libraries

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,960
that just like we're bringing in an rx

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,000
to do an observable we can bring in a

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,520
monad library

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,359
i think it's unlikely that they will

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,119
ship these because there will always be

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,559
so many different opinions

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,000
on what it should be called should it be

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,640
changed should it be flat map should it

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,640
be bind

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,559
they'll we'll never be able to agree on

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,440
the actual names of these things

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,960
so the concept can exist with we already

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,280
have the primitives in the language

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,040
the concept can be layered on with user

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,040
land code

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,480
awesome and this is the final one and it

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,079
will have to be very short

00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,440
and it might be one that you refuse to

00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,480
answer and get people to follow up on

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,880
twitter

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,000
and so somebody here said firstly thanks

00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,119
for the clear explanation

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,359
of monadz um they followed along

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,319
on twitter for a little bit and they've

00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,160
asked if

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,559
all of the community pushback on

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,880
terminology is discouraging a deeper

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,240
dive into this

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,119
it is absolutely a discouraging

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,640
um kind of thing that i have faced for a

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,680
lot of my career i wanted to learn

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,760
functional programming

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,760
20 years ago when i first heard about it

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
and i spent many many years more than a

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,040
decade discouraged by

00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,880
oh well you don't know the words and you

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,319
don't you don't know all the notation

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,880
and all of that so you can't really

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,880
learn

00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,800
what i'm hoping that i'm doing is

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,640
helping to lay some breadcrumbs

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,319
that help people come along on this

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,839
discussion and

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,040
one of the things that we have to accept

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,000
is that there will be people that are

00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,839
challenged by that

00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,680
there are people that have are used to

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,680
being the gatekeepers of that

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,200
uh sacred knowledge and i'm trying to

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,119
open this up to a broader of

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,800
audience and conversation so i think

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,800
there is a way but it is not

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,480
a smooth road it can be a very bumpy

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,400
road

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,000
and on that bombshell we are going to

00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,240
have to leave it there kyle

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,319

00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,599

00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,280

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,640

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,160
