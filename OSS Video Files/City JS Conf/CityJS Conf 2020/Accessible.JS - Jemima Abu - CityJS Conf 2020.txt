Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	Depending on how it’s used, JavaScript can either make or break the accessibility of a site. This talk aims to cover all the ways to ensure accessibility of a website that’s dependent on JavaScript. Specific points to be addressed include - fallback methods for browsers - avoiding obtrusive JavaScript - proper display of callback text such as errors and confirmation messages - handling user interactions - ensuring easy navigation

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,720
hi

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,439
hi everyone my name is jemima it's my

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,119
mavu

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,199
and today i'm going to be talking to you

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,880
about accessible javascript

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
and this very interesting position is

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
because i could not figure out

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
where i had good lighting in the room

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,079
i'm staying in so

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
this is fine anyway i'm jemima i am a

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
self-taught front-end developer and

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
school thought systems engineer from

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
lagos nigeria

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
currently working at telus office in

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
lithuania

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
you can find me online anywhere at

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,960
jeremiah so let's get right into it what

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,480
is accessibility

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
accessibility is the practice of

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
building products that everyone can use

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,879
so now i say this because it's kind of

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,560
like the most basic definition and when

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,159
you hear that you would think

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
well duh what's the point of building a

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,200
product that people can't use

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,439
but that is the fact when you have an

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
index wow

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,200
when you have an inaccessible website

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
you know sometimes your brain says a

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
word that your mouth

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
is running when you have an inaccessible

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,080
website it means that not everyone can

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
use that site not everyone can

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,439
go to your site and see things on it so

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,040
that's basically

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,720
building a useless product if you view

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,000
the site that is not accessible it is

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,280
useless to some people

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
there you go it's kind of useless to

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
everyone so accessibility comes in

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
different

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
forms and the problem whenever people

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
are building sites is that you don't

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,200
think about all the ways people are

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
going to access your site you're

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
building a site and you're seeing it the

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
way you see it you know you're like okay

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
this looks good

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,320
it's responsive i can see the colors but

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,079
there are people who

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,600
rely on screen readers who can't see

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
things that you have placed because you

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
put them

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
somewhere off the screen and you did not

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,759
put a proper tag that is

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,840
um telling a screen reader where that

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,200
thing should go there are people who

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
don't here for example there are people

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,879
who are

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,000
deaf and they can't hear the videos you

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,360
put on your site and you don't have any

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,080
captions available so people can't see

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
these things

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
can't hear these things that's what they

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,560
do basically the point is there are a

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,400
lot of

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
um factors in place for how

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
accessibility works there are people who

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,280
are browsing with slow internet or

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
people who are 102 or people who are

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,760
standing in direct sunlight

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,800
all of these things are factors you have

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
to put in place when you're building

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
your sites because that is what

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
accessibility is

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,120
accessibility is building products that

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,720
everyone can use regardless of their

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
abilities

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
i hope that clears that up now why is

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
accessibility important

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
to be fair it does sound kind of of your

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,760
stuff to hearing that

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,040
so people can use it but there are also

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,640
like actual

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,760
legal and business reasons behind why

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
you want to make sure your site is

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
accessible

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
the first reason and i would say the

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
most important reason is just because

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,040
it's kind of the right thing to do

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
you know it's kind of like a decency

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,319
thing like don't make a site that people

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
can't use the web is for everyone so

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
everyone should be able to use it when

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
you build your site make sure that it's

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
usable by everyone

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,480
but also because it's the law there is a

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
um 2016 eu web accessibility directive

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
that states that public sectors have to

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
ensure that their sites are accessible

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
by making them perceivable or probable

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,360
understandable and robust these are the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,760
accessibility guidelines by the wcag

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,599
and if you are in breach of this law

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
this this is a different um

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,360
law but still has the same this is a

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,120
different

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
body than the first law this is for the

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,640
uk the first one was for the eu

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,920
and in the uk if you do not

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,400
make sure your sites are accessible

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,519
you are open to lawsuits basically

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,120
people could sue you for having

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
accessible websites and there have been

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,159
previous cases much higher cases of

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
people actually getting lawsuits over

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
your site

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
so you know on the one hand it's the

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
right thing to do but on the other hand

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
you don't want a huge lawsuit on your

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,959
hand so

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
kind of make sure your sites are

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,760
accessible so now the title of this talk

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
was

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
accessible javascript so what is

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
accessibility

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
with relation to javascript the thing is

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,120
a lot of times i start talking about

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,959
accessibility we usually focus on html

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
you know make sure you have um

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
semantic elements or focus on css make

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,360
sure your text and your

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,519
background have appropriate

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,280
contrast but there are some areas where

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,479
javascript also helps with your

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
accessibility and we're going to look at

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,479
some of them

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,639
so how can we use javascript to improve

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,800
the accessibility of the sites

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
a web page containing javascript is

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
accessible if the functionality of the

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
site is device independent what that

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
means is

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
if you have settings scripts on your

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,680
site those scripts should be able to run

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
regardless of how people are navigating

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
through that site

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
whether they're using their keyboard or

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,199
they're using a mouse or they're using a

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
pointer or they're using

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
a scrolling thing on their phone people

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,919
should be able to access your sites

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
regardless

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
and the information is available to

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,040
assistive technologies what this means

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
is that you should not be preventing

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,240
assistive technologies like screen

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
readers for example from being able to

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
view the information on your sites

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
because you are rendering them in a way

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,160
that isn't accessible

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,759
so that's about it for how javascript

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
relates to accessibility so we're going

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
to go into now is how we can actually

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
write accessible javascript code how can

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,440
you write your code

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,360
in javascript to make sure that it's

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
accessible writing

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
accessible javascript so firstly we have

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
the area of content

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
so when you want to display content i

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
feel like this is something that we do a

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
lot

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,639
in javascript or in like a react

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,320
application or whatever you have like

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
hidden content and there's the button

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
people can click to display more content

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
and then you know it toggles the display

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,320
basically

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,919
but how do you make sure that this

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,680
content you're displaying

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
is available to screen readers if a

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
screen reader comes to a page and they

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
don't see a content on the page you're

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
not going to read it out so how do you

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,400
ensure that the screen reader

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
can see this content once you have

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
updated the page

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,000
you can do that by ensuring that you

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
always include your area attributes

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
within the content that you're

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
displaying so for example this is a very

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,479
um

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
basic javascript code to toggle an

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
element basically

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
so you know if your button has if your

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
button's inner text is show

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
then remove the hidden class list and

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,120
then so this like couple of first

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
the first three lines people they're

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
probably like very common like you would

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
do this a lot but then

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,160
what people forget is that even when you

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
are changing the display of things you

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
also need to change the attributes of

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,880
things you need to change the roles the

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,520
area rules that are giving to these

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
things

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
to make sure that your screen readers

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
are able to navigate them usually

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
so when you're setting your area

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,800
headings false that is letting the

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
screen reader know

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
that this thing can no longer be

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960
displayed on the page when you set it to

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,479
true that's letting the screen you don't

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
know that this content is now

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,319
on the page so hopefully that makes

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
sense

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,680
another thing we can have is timed

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,160
content this um

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
in a case where honestly like i could

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,120
not think of a case where somebody would

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
want to time something on their site

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
because it just seems kind of odd like

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,520
imagine going to wikipedia and they were

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
like this article would disappear in 30

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
minutes so hurry up

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
yeah but it's possible though it is

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,840
possible that sometimes you want to

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,039
display content for a certain period of

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
time and then remove it

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,720
so how do you make sure that screen

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,479
readers are able to detect when this

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,759
content has been updated and removed

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,120
basically

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
the arrow for that is the aria live role

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
so an aria live role is basically like

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
think of it as a

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
you're like adding an event listener to

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
the

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
content you just added to your web page

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
when you add your area live rule it's

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
letting the screen reader know that

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,800
this content is live so you can have

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
your area live equals off what that

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
means is that um

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
the screen reader is not going to be

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
detecting constant changes on it you can

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,720
also have your area live because polite

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
so polite is basically saying that wait

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
until you're done reading the first

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
whatever content comes before this thing

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
and then read the next one

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
and then you can have your area live to

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
be assertive so that is like

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
don't finish reading anything else just

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,840
read this one and read the updates from

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,520
this one

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
so this is how you would make sure that

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
your contents that you're constantly

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,560
updating is live on the page so now how

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,879
would we

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
include this in javascript for example

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
so let's say you've set your

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
timed content and then you want it to go

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
off you want the time content to

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
carry out its function once um the timer

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
hits zero

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,360
so you're setting your attribute area

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
hitting true but what you also need to

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
do is set your attributes of area live

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
to off so that means that the screen

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
reader would no longer be detecting

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,199
any live changes that would be happening

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,440
to this content

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
so yeah and then we have the issue of

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
navigation

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
a lot of i think like my whole

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,639
inspiration behind this talk was one

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
time i was on this site and i was trying

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,440
to scroll and i don't know if i'm going

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,960
to decide that does that thing that

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,039
when you scroll a little bit it like

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
moves the rest of the page up by itself

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
it's like i'm trying to scroll but in

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
the way my screen is there was like some

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
text at the bottom of the screen that i

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,399
couldn't read like there was a whole

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,919
paragraph at the bottom of the screen

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,440
but whenever i try to scroll a little it

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,919
would just take me to the next section

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,839
so i have to like argue with my phone

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,800
just to read like one paragraph at the

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,159
bottom of my screen

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,519
and basically a lot of times when people

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
implement these designs you're not

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,160
really thinking how people are going to

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,839
use it you're just thinking oh

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,160
it's fast scrolling it looks pretty

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,640
that's great what about people who rely

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,080
who people who can't just scroll there's

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,959
from screens fast people who have to use

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
like two fingers

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,000
because if you set your accessibility

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
features on your phone actually you do

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
have to

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
you can't scroll like the regular way

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,160
you have to scroll and

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
use the more pressure anyway so people

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
you don't really think of like

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
what you think is oh this is cool it's a

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
cool feature it's a cool effect but how

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,040
does nothing actually translate to

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,040
people who are using it

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
so that is the navigation aspects how

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
can you use javascript to improve the

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,640
way people

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,720
navigate through your sites so this is

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
basically how um

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
keyboard users would navigate through

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,040
sites this is through tabbing

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,800
what tab tabbing does is that it

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
goes to every element on the page that

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,519
can have focus so things like

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,040
buttons or links or um pretty much

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
buttons on links or any elements where

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,279
you set a focus on

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,120
that element can be tabbed to so now if

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,560
you want to focus a custom element in

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
javascript and i don't know that a lot

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
of times we end up

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
building custom elements because

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,160
sometimes you cannot spell it with react

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,680
applications sometimes you can't get the

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
elements like a native element that can

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,640
do what you want

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,320
if you're trying to build a custom drop

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
down for example you know so a lot of

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
times we end up using our custom

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,399
elements

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,480
but then the catch is when you build a

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
custom element even if you set your area

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,079
rules and everything you are

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,600
missing out on a lot of the imbued

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,680
native features

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,360
for example if you have a button you

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,160
have your native button like just your

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,680
butting tag

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,360
and now you have a div that you're

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,920
setting to the role of butting

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
the catches that div can't be focused on

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
because a development is not focusable

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
so you're missing out on focus that div

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,600
can't be clicked on

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,279
by itself unless you like properly put

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
the listener there so you're missing out

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,160
on click

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
that div can't detect key presses so the

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
point is there are a lot of native rules

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,800
you're missing out on

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,360
when you remove when you don't use

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,200
native elements but then what is the

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
what is like the alternative to that how

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
do we ensure that we don't really miss

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,519
out on all these rules just because we

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,480
want to use custom elements because

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
sometimes

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
you just don't have a choice so the

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,440
first thing you can do to make sure that

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
the custom element you build has focus

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
is to use a tab index

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
a tab index is what allows an element to

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
be focused on and what that means

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,640
basically is that

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,880
it adds it to the natural tabbing of the

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
page so if i set my tab index to zero

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
what that means is that

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
wherever that element is is going to

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
follow the natural tabling of the page

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,959
it's also possible that you want an

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
element to be the first thing that

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,720
people tab on when they reach a page

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
in that case i could have a tab index of

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,680
one as i'll show you in the next slide

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,120
sometimes you want to have like a skip

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
to main content button

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
and in that case you want it to be the

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,640
first thing people tab on when they

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
reach the page

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,839
so that's why i can give you a tab in

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,519
desktop one or sometimes you just don't

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
want an item to be tabbed on at all

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
so let's say that i have hidden elements

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
so this happens sometimes let's say you

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
have

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,880
a sidebar right if you know that sidebar

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
to be displayed don't click a certain

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
button

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
so you set a transition property on your

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,760
sidebar you move it to like 100 off the

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,440
screen

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,200
but the problem is because you did not

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
set any attributes that are actually

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,160
hiding that sidebar

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
if someone is using it if someone is

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,880
tabbing through the site at some point

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,399
they are going to be able to tab to the

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,360
elements in that sidebar

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
and it's just going to look like the um

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
the

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,880
outline or the cursor went missing for a

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
while or if there are like

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
some scripts you need to implement when

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
they open the sidebar that's going to

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
cause some errors for your page so you

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,160
also want to think about that if you're

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,760
hiding things in the page and you don't

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,320
want them to receive focus

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,320
you set your tab index to minus one so

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
what we have here is a skip to main

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,440
content link

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,880
um this is something very common among

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
pages that have like

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,040
a lot of navigation for example so you

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
can see here i have like 10 links

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
and then i have the actual main content

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,320
of the page if i don't want people to

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,760
have to tab through all 10 links and

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
that's just like a random number it

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
could be like 100 links or whatever or

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,680
like

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,720
50 images before you can get to the

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,000
actual content

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
if i'm people to be able to just get to

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
the main content of the page the best

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
thing to do is include the skip to main

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
content so like i said in the last slide

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
you would just give your skill to main

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,800
content a tab index of one

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
so you did the first thing you could tab

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,680
on the page and then maybe you could

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,680
include like a um

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,639
like a css property to make it display

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,480
when it gets focused basically

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,760
so what i have here is my skip button

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
and then i have my main section so

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
basically what i'm doing is that once

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,560
you click the skip to main content of

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
the page

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
it gives the main section focus what

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
that means is that

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
i have clicked the main um skip domain

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
content it's taking me to the main

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,200
content immediately it's not going to

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,480
have to make me tab through all those

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
links before i can get to the main

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
content

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
so it's just really useful for making

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
sure that you handle the focus handle

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
updating focus

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
in a way that is useful to people

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
because people who are scrolling through

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,279
their keyboards or

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
who rely on screen readers don't just

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,320
have the option of like you know just

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
scrolling really fast and moving past

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
all those images you've created

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
so you need to keep that in mind as well

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
and then another option you can have in

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
your page is something called autofocus

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,760
so this kind of works like let's say you

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
have

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
you have a list of items on the page and

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,720
the first thing i want to do when they

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
get to that page is to be able to search

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
through these items

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
you could have a search bar in your page

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
and what you want to do is basically

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,279
once that page loads

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,639
just focus on the search about

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,160
automatically what that means that they

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,639
don't have to tab through the entire

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,240
page to get to the search bar first

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
they can just like start typing in the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
search but the minute the page loads

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,839
so you know this um i think like auto

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
focusing it does have a bit of

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,040
like uh debates behind it because like

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,639
on the one hand you want to take it with

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,760
the user control like what if they don't

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,040
actually want to

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,480
they don't actually want the searching

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,160
to be the first thing also what if there

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
are links before that they wanted to get

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,839
to before getting the search bar

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,959
but you know it's one of those like give

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,480
and take things it applies to the

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,959
situation sometimes it's useful

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,720
sometimes it's not

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,320
and then updating focus this is another

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,040
very important thing because a lot of

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
times

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
people don't do this if you have a model

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
on your page or if you have anything

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
that's going to be a pop-up or anything

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
that's going to be

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
on top of other elements in your page

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
you want to make sure that that thing

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,880
actually gets focused

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,160
once it's rendered for example if i'm

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
tapping through a page and i click a

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,680
button that

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,519
displays a model or a pop-up but then

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,800
because you have not set focus on that

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
popup what i mean i'm going to

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
keep on tabbing to the page until i'm

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,079
able to reach that

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
popup because that is how tabbing works

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,040
it goes in the

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,800
order of which your elements are listed

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
so you can't just like jump to

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
a new element just because it was placed

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,360
on the page so you have to make sure

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,959
that whenever you introduce anything to

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,760
the screen that you want people to be

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,480
able to

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
use automatically you want to make sure

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
that

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
you put focus on that screen imagine if

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,760
you had like a model but then

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,440
for some reason the model was at the

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
bottom of the screen so even when people

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,839
popped up the model they still had to

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,639
scroll all the way down to the bottom of

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
the screen

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
that's basic that's basically much the

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
same thing as

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,839
not putting focus on the things so yeah

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
you know once you open your model or

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,600
whatever you set your style you can just

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
literally set your focus property

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
and then also set your area hitting

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,760
properties another thing you want to do

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
is hide the previous property

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,360
hide the previous let's see the previous

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,160
element for example if

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,360
i am putting a model on the page what i

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
want is that

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
the rest of the page should be hidden to

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,759
the screen reader oh that was a typo

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
that should say um modal set attributes

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,480
area hitting false

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
yeah so the modal should no longer be

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,720
hidden but the main page should be

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
hidden

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
so i'm setting the main page area

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,199
healing property to true so that means

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,040
that people won't see the content of

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,800
that the screen reader once

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,720
they basically want to see the contents

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,360
of that main page anymore

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
so yeah and then finally we have the

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
interaction aspect what this means is

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
basically how people are able to

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,440
interact with your site you know a lot

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,800
of times javascript is written for

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,079
functionality purposes that means you

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,519
want people to be able to

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
click on things you want effects to be

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,120
able to happen so are you making sure

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
that everyone can interact with your

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,480
site in the same way regardless of what

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
technologies or what abilities they have

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
i forgot i put that gif there i just

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,480
thought it was so funny because it's

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
like the cat is interacting with the

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
sites

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,199
so yeah is your site is your site cards

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,199
accessible

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,639
if the cart was going on your javascript

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,199
site wouldn't be able to access it

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,720
that's a very important question so yes

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,079
the most important thing when it comes

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
to interaction is the

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,000
handler events a lot of times you create

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
an element and then you put your little

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,800
on click property you know i think it's

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
fine because yeah i can click this

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,399
element now

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,600
what about people who don't use mouses

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
you know people who are tabbing through

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
your sites people who are using screen

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
readers and they just want to press

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
a button enter or they just want to

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
press tabs open the dropdown but they

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,959
just have to press

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,079
spacebar or they want to submit a form

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,959
without having to tap all the way to the

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,959
summit button

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
are you including enough handler events

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,720
to make sure that people

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,400
can access your sites in the same way

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
regardless of which technologies they're

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
using let's think of it as a

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
like newton's second law of

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,760
accessibility you know for every

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,079
mouse event there must be an equal and

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,199
accurate keyboard event just think of

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
that whenever you create

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,760
a on click event are you also creating

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,799
an on keepers event or another key down

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,520
event or

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,559
yada yada so it's actually just really

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,000
easy to implement

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,200
it's it's not you don't even need to do

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
anything more special you just need to

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,520
like

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,160
call the um call the function

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
detects the key that has been pressed

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
this e

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,080
which is basically saying if the enter

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,600
key is pressed and then i'm just calling

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
the handle click function so if they

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
press the

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,600
enter button it's going to do the same

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,799
thing in my handle click function

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
which is really easy and yeah that is

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
about it for

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
the ways we can write accessible

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
javascript there are actually a bunch

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,320
more ways a bunch more let's say um

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
specific ways and there are some cases

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
which i've listed at the end of this

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
site in a bunch of

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
lists and links of resources but for now

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
we're going to move on to the testing

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,120
for accessibility aspect so if you have

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,640
you've written your code then you think

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
it's fine but how do you actually know

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
if this thing you've written

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
is accessible the first way you can test

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,880
for accessibility in your site is to

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,960
manually test it

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
go to your site tab through it does any

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
hidden content get focused is there any

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
point where

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
you're focusing your focusing outline

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
gets

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,480
lost to the page and you can't tell what

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
point it's on because

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
sometimes people remove the outline from

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
their page

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,200
and what that means is basically even if

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,799
i'm focusing on elements i'm not going

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,480
to know which element i'm focusing on

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
or also if you have hitting elements

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,440
that is somewhere off the page

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,520
but that element is still getting

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,799
focused you are going to lose that

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,320
outline of your page

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
so yeah is there anything which is mouse

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,200
operable which does not get keyboard

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,480
focus what that means is are there any

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,400
buttons that should be able to

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,000
be clicked or any buttons that should be

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,799
able to or any elements that should be

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,360
able to interact

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,440
with like a drop down toggle or

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,280
selecting options in the list

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
that does not get keyboard focus so i

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
cannot tab to those elements for example

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
i can only click them with the mouse

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,640
are there any custom controls or widgets

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,200
that cannot be operated with keyboard

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
only used

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,120
are there any custom components you're

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
creating that people can't use the

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,799
keyboard to navigate i can't press

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
enter to click your button or i can't

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,440
tab to scroll through a list of drop

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,799
downs

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,760
so these are manual tests you can think

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,960
of when you're going through your page

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
and the thing i like to do is i

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
like to um go to a page if you created

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,120
the page just go to it and

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,240
on the body tag just set an opacity of

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
zero you know

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
so that'll just make it pretty blank and

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,000
then literally just like turn on the

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
screen reader

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,280
the one i use is chromebooks turn on

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
screen reader in your browser and just

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,120
tab

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,120
through the page and see if it actually

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,640
makes sense see if you can understand

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,480
what parts of the page you're on or if

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,760
you can navigate through the page easily

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
that's it for manual testing some

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
accessibility testing tools because are

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
there's the web accessibility evaluation

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,960
tool it's just the site where you can go

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
and enter the url of the site you want

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
to test for accessibility

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,159
and it basically gives you a report on

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,159
like the structure and the design

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,760
and then it suggests like how you can

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,039
fix stuff and how you can

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,520
you know repair stuff because fix and

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,159
repair a different word

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,919
lighthouse lighthouse is the chrome

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
extension so literally if you just go to

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,600
your chrome i think around where you

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
have

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
some stuff you can just go to lighthouse

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,520
and it will generate an audit for you

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
with like your performance and your seo

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
and your

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,799
i think best practices or something and

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
accessibility and it just gives you a

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,200
score and it tells you what you've done

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
wrong about your rights and what you can

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,640
test for by yourself

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,480
chromevox is a screen reader in the

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
chrome browser you can use like whatever

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
screen reader

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
comes with your browser it's just

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,480
basically helpful for knowing how people

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,120
who don't use let's say mouses for

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
example

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,919
would use your site and then um ally.js

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,120
that's a11y

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,880
dot js it's a really cool um light

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,159
javascript framework library that helps

00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
you creates

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,960
how does it work it like creates custom

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,679
elements and helps you like fix all

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
those focus

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,640
issues or keyboard handle issues that

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
you may run into when you're creating

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
your own custom elements

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
another thing i forgot to include here

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,880
is the um

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
web accessibility visual studio code

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
extension if you just go to the visual

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,600
studio called

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
marketplace and type in like um

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
accessibility

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,240
i think web accessibility will pop up

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
and it will show you an extension it's

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
really cool for when you're writing code

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,320
that lets you know

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,480
where you can use the semantic element

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
or if your rule is missing from a

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,840
generic element that you're using

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
so yeah those are some tools you can try

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,919
out and then these are the resources for

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,760
this talk

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,520
um i did have a demo which

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,120
i'm not going to run but if you don't

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
want to see the demo though you can go

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
to

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,760
that site there try slash access will

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,919
hide from js

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,360
and you should be able to see the demo

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,640
right there i also have the source code

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,000
for that site on my github github.com

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
accessible hyphen.js

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,840
and if you want to access this slides

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,799
you can go to my website gmailmable.com

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,799
slash slides

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,320
slash accessible hyphen.js and you

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,799
should be able to get access it's not

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
that

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,039
i have a list of articles you can check

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,559
out in case you want to read up more

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,840
on accessibility with javascript these

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,760
are really great there is writing

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
javascript accessibility in mind by

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,039
manual

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,559
he talks um about just a really cool

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
article he explains like how the

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,240
focusing works and how you should

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,000
be polite to your users when you're

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,520
updating content on the page

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,120
there's accessible javascript and

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,039
overview of accessible javascript the

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,400
best practices for accessibility

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,240
how accessible you taught me to build

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,760
javascript all really great articles on

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,960
understanding the importance and how

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,280
javascript can

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
aid accessibility and there's also the

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,480
um wai

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
aria authoring practices this is a very

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,679
helpful tool because

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,360
it's basically like a think of it as a

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,400
dictionary for elements

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
so you know sometimes you're trying to

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
create a custom element and you don't

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,720
know

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
which role belongs to what or you don't

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,559
know what other properties it could need

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
that's basically what that link is

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,919
basically just telling you that this is

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,120
the element these are the rules it needs

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,320
so if you're trying to create the custom

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
elements these are all the things you're

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
going to need to put inside that element

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,159
so yeah it's really great that's about

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
it for me

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
thank you guys so much for listening

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,240
thanks so much for tuning in if you have

would love to connect with you

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:37,840

please add them now to the q a tab

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,760
and we shall um we shall ask away

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,200
the the the thing that means when you

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,640
said it i wrote it down straight away

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,240
the word is for everyone so everyone

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
should be able to use it i did like that

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,520
tomorrow i think that's it yeah

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,960
sums it up very yeah i can't take credit

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,559
for that that's not actually my quote i

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
just can't remember i think it was from

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,799
like the creator of the web himself

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,799
actually it's like i'm fairly

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,000
i just can't remember i was thinking it

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,960
could be a tim burns anything i think i

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,159
couldn't tell if you've modified it but

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
yeah it might just be a straight quote

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,480
from him yeah exactly

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,880
it is it's from tim berners-lee you know

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
well

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,760
what he said is everyone and then i

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,720
guess i attacked only so everyone's able

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,679
to use that part

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,400
yeah look at me paragraph paraphrase

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,360
all right we've got a question in do you

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,799
have any advice

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,640
on where to put skip to content link

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,320
should it be the first thing tagged to

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,159
if using a keyboard or after the

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,440
navigation or elsewhere

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
yeah it should definitely be the first

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,400
thing tab to you if using a keyboard

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
because basically what you're trying to

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,000
say is that you're trying to

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,120
let them skip to the main content so you

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
don't want to have to go through your

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
entire navigation

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
before they condense skip to make

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,200
content so yeah it should be literally

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,720
the first thing on your page

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,039
you can just hide it somewhere up with

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,799
like css and then if

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,640
it gets focused then you scroll you just

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,320
slide this into view and let people skip

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,559
the main content

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,120
yeah makes sense very good okay

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,640
um is there an easy way to handle focus

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,880
when a component like a model is

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,799
destroyed yeah so

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,480
so um i think in the slide i did mention

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,240
that you can set

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
area heading to true and then area

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,159
heating force for the main page

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,679
and then you can put a focus element on

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,159
the model itself

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,080
so there is this method it's basically a

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,880
way of getting the last

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,039
active element so what you want to do is

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,520
you know honestly um manuel did

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,760
um go into this in detail in the link in

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,039
his article right

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,200
you could check that out but also what

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,279
you want to do is you have a variable

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,880
that's basically like large focus and

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,960
before the model is open you can just

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,200
set like document.activeelement so that

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,200
it is going to do is that it's going to

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,960
select whichever element was the last

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
thing that was focused on that page and

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
then once you close the elements

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,559
you just want to put last focus back in

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,559
focus so that's pretty much how it works

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
makes sense okay we've got one here with

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
two votes right it's a very popular

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,279
question

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,880
do you have any questions stakeholders

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:39,840
on board with acceptability

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,760
team or stakeholders abilities

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,039
i get this a lot because it's such a

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,000
thing you know like you're trying to

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,840
view the sighting you're trying to make

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,480
sure it's accessible but in the pm or

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,080
like um whoever is in charge is just

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
like yeah we don't need all that just

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,360
like

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
ship it we just need the product and the

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,279
thing is

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
like i said that's i feel that's the

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
reason why i did show that there are

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
actual legal ramifications to not making

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
sure

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,559
it's accessible so i feel like that is

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,919
one way to like kind of get them on

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,120
board with you taking more time to make

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
things accessible

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,880
out that they could be in breach of

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,120
lawsuits you point out that

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,559
it is it's kind of negative pr people

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,080
can't use yourself and then also there

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,679
are a lot of business benefits right it

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
gives you higher seo

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,679
if it is more accessible so that's good

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
for the business case it's also just

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
like

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
you have like higher user retention

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,200
you're not as open to lawsuits

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,039
this could just like structure it in a

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,919
business way you know like come at it

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,200
from the business aspect not so much the

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,000
decency aspect so yeah

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,120
yeah that makes sense okay and we've got

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,679
great presentation my question

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,360
if content becomes accessible to humans

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
does it mean the content will also be

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
fully semantically visible for crawlers

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,559
in search

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,919
that's a nice question that's a funny

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,399
question what do you mean accessible to

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,399
humans

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
more accessible to human beings

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,480
well okay yes in that case yes that is

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,399
because

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,240
crawlers basically which is kind of

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,080
brings max my point on seo

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,240
whenever let's say you're going through

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,320
the site for like indexing purposes on

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,520
like a search result or something sites

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,840
that have proper structure

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,240
sites that have semantics properly

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,679
labeled um

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,960
images they have all stacks where they

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,679
need all taxes they have captions they

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
end up having

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,240
higher seo values than sites that don't

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,679
have all these things if the structure

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,200
of your site is out of place or if you

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,080
don't use as many semantic elements you

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,159
actually

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,480
lose 0 points let's think of it like

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,039
that so yes when you make your content

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
fully accessible it is i guess it would

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,600
be more

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,200
visible to the crawlers yes it's also

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
good for like indexing purposes and

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,520
stuff

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
yeah generally it's good practice isn't

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,559
it and yeah

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
from doing the right thing because

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
that's not exactly the right thing by

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,960
the standard something so yeah okay

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,240
that's good

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,679
um is there an easy way to handle focus

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
when a component like a model is

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,000
destroyed we've already done that why

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,520
don't we yeah i think i've already done

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,480
that one i think we have i think that

00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,760
might be all of them there's any other

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,559
questions

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,559
okay great

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,480
i think that's all of it all right that

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,039
was a really good talk i think

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,039
everyone else wants

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
if anyone does want to talk or you could

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,600
just hit me up on twitter or whatever
