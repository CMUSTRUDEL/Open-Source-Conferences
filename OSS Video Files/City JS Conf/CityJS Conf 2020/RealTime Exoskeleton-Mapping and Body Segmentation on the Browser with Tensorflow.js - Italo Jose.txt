Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	Are you already through in mapping your exoskeleton like Kinect and at the same time segment your body separable like your head, foot, hand and etc just by webcam? So, in this talk, we will show how we can implement a deep learning model with Tensorflow.js that makes it for us, and the best part, everything running in the browser!

[Music]

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,720
hi guys

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,119
so my name is italo and

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,400
i'm developer circles organizer here in

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,000
sao paulo

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,520
microsoft mvp in ai category

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,760
and uh today i'm work at a solution

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,719
architect actor vortex fintech

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
and i'm a dependent consultant in intel

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,600
js yes

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,000
too so um

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,280
i'm brazilian developer and today i will

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
talk about

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,399
uh how to extract my skeleton and

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,680
segment my body use a simple

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,160
big how you can uh segment my barrie

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
uh use a simple picture uh take it from

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
my

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,080
iphone take from my android you know and

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,439
how can i do it

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,720
from the browser using my webcam

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,000
so uh we we use the tensorflow.js

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,240
things are flowjs it's a wrapper from

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
tensorflow that is a deep learn uh

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
library

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,119
and we have some projects using these

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,280
libraries uh for example the

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
picks the body picks is a project that

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,240
we can

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,640
uh do some things like uh segments the

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,840
your head segment your body your hands

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
your foot you know and we can extract

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,960
our skeleton

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,520
from with this library too and

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,280
know our positions and make application

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,799
with this for example we'll ask you

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,320
you can see here uh a blur of humans

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,920
in where we can we can do other funny

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,960
implementations too like uh draw

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,079
make a animation using your body

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,759
or just to blur your screen

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,200
when you got a wrong position yeah

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,840
uh so how we can

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
do it it's the most important of

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,319
presentation

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,520
so uh we will build

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,000
a javascript application here any

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
framework uh it's just a clean and

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
vanilla

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,400
javascript okay so uh

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,280
to start we need to import the

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,640
tensorflow.js

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
and the body picks j the very pics

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,360
library okay

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,800
and we do it with uh just um

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,480
just with the cdn link in my head

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,160
okay so after that we create

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,200
uh you know body picks uh image tag

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,879
with uh with id

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,239
and with my victory okay

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,920
and in my descript i just get my

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,120
image with my by my id

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,239
okay so uh i load

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,440
my my model with body picks

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,040
and inside this method we have uh

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,239
we love we are loading a network okay uh

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,280
uh a deep learn model that we

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,440
can choose the architecture if you don't

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,560
know about deep learn don't worry okay

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,519
it's a super high level library

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,200
but if you understand about deep

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,680
learning you can configure

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,239
it a little bit so we have a

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
architecture we can use we can choose by

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
mobilenet

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,440
or resnet mobile.net is um

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,720
is our architecture to run in

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,959
in devices like arrest bar or

00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,159
our mobile and we have the resnet that

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,400
our architecture is for run in robust

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,720
machines you know we have another um

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,360
another option that is output stride

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,680
it's about your output resolution

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
okay we have a multiplier this

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,880
multiplier is only

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,720
is used only by moot mobile net

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,040
and this value is about how much

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,120
uh convolutionals you want in your

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
mobile net architecture

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
again if you don't know about deep learn

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,199
don't worry you can use this

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,199
library um like

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,600
a developer engineering you know so uh

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
and we have a quant byte is so much

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,800
bigger is your

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,080
model so uh with somewhat big

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,440
your quant bytes property most perceives

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,639
your

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,000
your uh result okay

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,440
and after we load our model we just

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
uh call the segment person passing an

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
image

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,960
as a parameter so we can pass an image

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,160
and we can pass a optional argument like

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,039
flip horizontal

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
for example if your rabbicon is flipped

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,280
okay

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,639
uh internal resolution so we have

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,520
a super resolution image

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,880
and a four key image you know and you

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,639
want

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
uh just predict a simple person inside

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
this

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,360
image to get the head information

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,000
and if you have a big image you will

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
have

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,240
a big procession you know so for this

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
we choose the internal resolution that

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
the body picks will go up this image

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
will get these easements and we will

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,759
resize it for a medium quality high

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
quality

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,400
or full quality that full quality is the

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
original quality

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,319
and we have the segmentation threshold

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,840
the segmentation threshold

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
is how much uh

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,199
how much presentation you want the the

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
ai

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
the diploid model uh find a person for

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
example

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,000
okay i got this object and this object

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,280
has

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,840
uh 50 of be a person no

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,199
i i don't want this object i just want

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,120
objects that has

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,520
70 percent to be a person you know

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,280
so this is the full code this is the

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
basic the basic fold uh

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
the basic basic code and we have here

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
just

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,560
the loader library uh load your image

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,440
and just

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,240
predicting our segmentation segmentation

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,759
person

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,120
and inside our segment person return

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:50,560
what do we have we have this object

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,599
it is an object containing um

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,120
outposes you know so

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,000
outpost is like all persons inside your

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
image

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,360
and we have their the zero position

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,319
containing many key points and what do

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
we have

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
inside the key points uh inside the key

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
points

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
we have for example uh the part of my

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
body

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
so i have my news and my news is

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,680
positioned

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,919
at uh in x position uh 3

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,160
314 and my x position

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:34,080
in 78 uh pixels okay this metric is

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
in pixels and we can just print this

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639
information in my

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
webcam in front my my image or i can

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
just

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,919
got information to do some um

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,199
you know some application uh knowing my

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,240
my news i can't just ask for the user to

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,720
uh go to the left or go to the right

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
and just verify if the user are

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
possessing it

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,639
in the right place you know so

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,479
uh but how we can um an

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,280
observation this method just uh segment

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,000
one unique person okay and how we can

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,120
segment

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,319
mood person inside our image so i can

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
use the segment

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,960
mood person method okay and in this

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
method we have another's

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,599
properties like the free horizontal

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,080
internal resolution

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
and we have max detection how much

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,680
people you want to detect inside your

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,399
image and we have this car threshold

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,080
it's the same thing uh it's a little bit

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,640
different the threshold

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
uh the previous threshold because this

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,000
threshold is related

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,200
by connected parts of my body so

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,519
uh i want to connect my body

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
my i want to connect my

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,959
my hand with the rest of my body

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,720
when this part has a 40 percent

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:06,160
of be connected you know we have these

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,360
nm's radius it's related

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,120
about how much you want to suppress

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,160
you want to uh have a shaped

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,640
uh body segmentation and we have the

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,920
mean k

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
points car is how much key points i want

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
to detect

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,600
say okay this is a person i have a

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,640
person here

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,279
okay and we have our last

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
option that is refine steps the refine

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
steps

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,440
is how much prediction do you want to

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:43,200
do as the same image and to get a better

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,320
a better uh result you know because

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,000
when we are working with deep learn

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,560
when you put an imagine to predict

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
it the result not necessarily will be

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,320
the same in the final okay

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,440
so uh what this will

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,399
result the result of this method will be

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
an array

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:09,839
with many persons okay and each person

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,800
we have here the zero the one the two

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
and each item inside this array we have

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
the data property

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,560
the data property is uh is your image

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
in pixels okay so it's a big big big

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,120
array

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,480
containing uh any

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,560
purpose about uh your pixels and

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,560
what what uh part of your body

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,800
is in inside there that pixel

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,079
we have the height and the width the

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
size of your image

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,519
and we have the pose that uh has

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,560
explained it

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,320
in the previous slide it's

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,120
just remain just to remind the pose is

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
this object we have all key points

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,839
inside

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,600
okay and we have a data ahead with two

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:05,360
so um

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,680
and how we can visualize these results

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
uh how we can manipulate this data to

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,480
visualize what

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,680
are where what is happening with my data

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,560
so i can uh segment it

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,519
i can't just draw a mask inside my

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,800
person

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,680
i'm not uh segmenting my my

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
my body here i just segmenting my person

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
it's different

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,360
just remember just unnoticed and here

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,839
we have another code that we load the

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,839
image

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,040
by element by id we load our body picks

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,240
and we call the segment mode person past

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,760
an image okay so i just call

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
the method to mask passing my

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
segmentation

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
uh this this object is the same object

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,320
that we

00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,000
we saw the pre in previous slide

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,279
and my mask my mask contain content mask

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,800
okay

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,920
and we can call the draw mask method

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,120
uh passing as argument my canvas to draw

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,600
it in the browser

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:17,360
okay or if you are working with react

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,800
vue.js or some

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,440
some ionic angler or something like this

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,440
that works in a mobile

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,560
it will work okay and this is awesome

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,600
so we have the canvas our image

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,959
okay our image can be our video

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,160
and we will see it in our demo

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,560
we passed our mask some opacity so this

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,360
opacity is about how much you want to

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,399
opacity

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,760
your mask okay so you uh want

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
a super blank mask or you want

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,000
some transparent mask

00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,079
uh you we have the next uh

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,519
parameter is the mask blur amount so

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
uh it's a bit it's about how uh how i

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,920
want to burn my

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,000
my mask and the flip horizontal if my

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:15,839
webcam is flipping my image okay

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,880
so how we can get colored visual result

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
and segment my body different for this

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,040
image

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:27,279
to this image how we can get it

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,440
so we can use uh the same

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,560
quite the same code okay but we have

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
some difference here

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,800
the first one is the segment mode person

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,680
parts parts it's super important to

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,199
remember

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,000
and that we will got uh segmentation

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,199
of my each part of my body you know and

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,040
we have

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,240
our mask we that we can we need to use

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,600
another method we did

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
is to color red part mask okay it makes

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
sense

00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,320
um so here

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:06,000
we got a draw mask method with the same

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,800
parameters you know and

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
here we will got the result of my parts

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,360
of my body

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,399
and what i can do with my

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,600
segmentation you know here we have an

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,480
example when i just segment my

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,279
body and not segment my body parts

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,199
segment my

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,639
own body you know so what i can do with

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,279
this i can bl i can make the burn effect

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,000
that the

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:39,519
themes the skype you have and the other

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,040
video conference platform uh use

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,399
i guess they zoom use it too but

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,680
um how we can do it

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:53,120
we have an element okay a limited image

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,240
we have the our network loaded by body

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,199
pixel

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
we segment a person a unique person it's

00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
not

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,839
segmenting mood person and not

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,959
segmenting my body parts

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:10,160
okay so i just um

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,279
i just draw make sorry

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,399
i just call the draw broken effect

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,440
method and i pass my canvas

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
my image and my segmentation my

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,320
background blur amount

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
my edge blur amount this uh is important

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
because

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,720
the edge blend amount is a little bit

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,920
different from previous slide

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,279
this edge blond amount is how much

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,399
blur you how much shape

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,519
shapeness you want you uh your

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,120
background

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,680
having around your body you know

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
and uh the flip horizontal if your

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
webcam

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:55,199
are flipped and what we can do

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:58,320
with segmentation part parts we can blur

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,600
our body parts and what it can blur

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,240
we can blur our face for example so

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,040
uh it is just it's just remember it's

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
just a

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,199
example you can do so much things your

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,880
creative

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:16,399
is the limit okay and uh how we can

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,680
do it uh i did this

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,440
at this time i will use the segment mode

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,880
person parts it's important to note

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,920
because it's different for

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,959
segment person okay

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,079
and i have here

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,440
a different parameter is this

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,959
is the body parts id to blur

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,680
so i choosing the zero and one parts

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,519
but i can uh choose any any parts and

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,880
you can check the documentation

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,240
for know what part what numbers

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,519
what is the id of each part

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
and here i'm i'm blurring your my lefty

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
face

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,920
and my right face okay so

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,199
i just asked for uh the body picks blur

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
a body part

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
of my image okay so i pass my canvas my

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
image

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,799
and all these uh

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,919
all these arguments that you already see

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,480
before

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:24,160
okay so let's go to the terminal

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:28,400
and what do you we will do

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,559
in this demo um we have a simple demo

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
here

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:38,160
and uh

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,400
we will just blur my face when my hand

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:46,720
is uh inside my hand you know

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
and we can visualize to my segmentation

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,520
so

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,559
uh i will just get some space here

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,679
i'm i'm printing my

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,799
i'm printing my hand and my left

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,240
and right face okay so

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,280
when i do it when i intersect in my hand

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,880
with my my head

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,600
i will learn the image and we can

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
uh just bring our key points to and this

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,919
k point

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
is our ex excellent you know so i have

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,559
my face here

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,559
i have uh my my body here

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,840
okay you know as you can see here

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
so how we can do it with javascript to

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,280
run

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,440
in browser and vanilla

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
javascript so um

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,880
we have a code here and we have

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,240
hml css file and a js

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
file okay i don't will explain the css

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
because

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,960
uh i guess the most important here

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,840
is the javascript in my html

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,720
it's a simple code as you can see here

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
we have

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,960
um my

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,160
libraries import by cdn you know

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,280
i'm importing the tensorflow js and my

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,799
body picks

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,840
okay so i have my canvas

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,360
to draw my my modified image

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:26,000
and i have uh my video okay

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,960
so i have a dashboard just to

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,559
to contain some checkbooks like a

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,280
segmentation mask

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,240
and detection mask the detection point

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,840
sorry

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,880
just to you uh visualize it we have our

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,679
check box here

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,799
okay and here we have my canvas

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,120
and my script that text yeah yes

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
what do we have inside the tech js

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,919
script

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,440
uh so we have some selectors

00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,960
i have my video uh i have my canvas

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,799
i create a context for this canvas okay

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,520
and i have my two check box so

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,039
i'm just defining some configurations

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,280
for my

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,919
my video and i i set the canvas to have

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,200
the same

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,320
size of my of my

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,720
video so i called the navigator

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,039
by media device and i get the user media

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
pass my video my video configuration

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,360
here

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,280
okay and when the stream start

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,240
i will fill my stream in my video okay

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,280
it's not new here okay it's a simple

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,720
thing

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,080
so we have here uh the

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,520
plane event when my my video will start

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,880
to play

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,480
i just will load my body picks model

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,520
okay i will set my canvas to block

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,720
and i start i will start to predict it

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,640
so uh i will got an image

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,240
and i will predict make a prediction

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,280
here uh just to

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:12,480
verify my if my hand is in front my head

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,520
so if true i will just blur my

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,080
head okay so it's it's super important

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,880
for example

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
in events you can uh just make an

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,600
application

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,640
to detect some qr code uh in

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,840
in front the the your perspective so

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,320
you can read this code if you're

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,640
attending

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,799
don't permit you to take a victory from

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,600
here you can just

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,320
blur that that face you know it's

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,679
awesome for

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,039
event organizers so

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,159
um in my predict uh

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,840
method it need to be a sync okay

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:55,280
because uh this process is a little bit

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,480
uh high it's a have a high

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,039
processor so because this we need to

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,720
work

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,400
a sync mode and to load

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,240
on video every video project that you

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,440
will work will have this while true okay

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,400
so it's it's not a bad pattern

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,720
i know it's a little bit too strange but

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,559
uh it's the common uses of

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,600
when you are working with videos so here

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,200
i get a segmentation so i'm working with

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,000
only one

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
person okay in front of the camera and i

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
just

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,120
as called the segment person's body

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,799
okay and i pass my video i it's

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
different from the slide because

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,080
here i'm working with a video i'm not

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,000
working with i

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,039
image okay so i just pass my video

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,320
here my global variable video

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,520
okay to my body picks

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,559
method and the body picks can handle it

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,600
very well so here

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,520
i just check if segmentation outpost

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,080
zero so if have we have some

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,120
we have some pose inside your

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,600
segmentation

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
okay i just continue it because i don't

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
want to process

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,760
all my image if i don't have any person

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,679
in front of my camera

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,360
so i have the method withdrawal so if i

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,480
detect someone

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,679
i just will draw it okay and inside this

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,960
method

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,640
i have this this code i check if

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,679
this show mask checkpoint is checked

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,000
so i just showed the mask my mask

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,360
okay so uh if i have the show points

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,520
checkpoint checked

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,840
i will print my ket my key points okay

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,720
so in the first uh condition

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,440
i will get my personal segmentation for

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,120
this

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,840
uh for this variable just to don't work

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,279
with

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,039
reference here i will get my data

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,559
and i will fill the data properly with

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,840
a filter so what i what i do here

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,679
i have a segmentation of all my body

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,679
and i need to filter my hand and my head

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,880
so here i go to the data property

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,799
and i iterate off each pixel

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,880
and i check if the id of this pixel

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:37,039
is 0 or 1

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,320
or 10 or 11. so here i'm filtering

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,279
for my lefty face here i'm feeling for

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,640
my right

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:49,200
face uh the 10 and 11 ideas

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
is about my hands my right hand and my

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
left hand

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,279
so if not i just return a minor one

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,640
to it's a it's not have it don't have

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,760
any anybody any body parts you know

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,039
so if true i just uh return

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,559
the valet okay here i have a new

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,840
segmentation that

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,960
are filtered by my head and my face

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,240
okay so uh

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,440
i just called the two color red part

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,400
mask because the body picks will return

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
an image

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,200
okay that are coloring my

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,360
head and my face so i just

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
asked for body picks to draw my man to

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,480
draw a mask

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,760
um involving my hand

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,120
and my face okay so

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,400
and why i i do this

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,679
this uh this filtering because

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:53,200
in the future i will need to

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,320
um to come to verify if my hand

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
is intersecting my head you know because

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,279
this i'm not

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,320
asking for body pics to filter it and

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,520
i'm filtering

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,559
it in myself you know

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,000
so else i just will

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:14,799
clean my my context you know and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
if my show points checkpoint is checked

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:21,600
i mean if you ask it for show

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,120
the key points i just will verify

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,480
all the pose of my of my

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,760
person segmentation and for each pose

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
i will call the the method draw key

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,679
points

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,880
passing my pause key points and passing

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,080
a threshold

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,200
okay and this method uh

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,320
i just iterated for each

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,520
key point i that i have okay i check

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,960
if my key point score is less than mean

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,039
confidence

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,240
okay and i i just print it in my

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:01,120
context it's simple okay it's simple but

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
we can got this information to do some

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,240
some applications like

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,360
um grow up your hand

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,279
um grow up your hand your

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,840
right hand or girl down your

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,559
left hand and something like this you

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,799
can

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,679
get this information of the person

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,159
position

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
using the key points you know here i'm

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,120
just printing it

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,279
so after that

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:35,120
after i draw the after the draw method

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:40,080
i just got the verification if my hand

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,080
is in front my head you know

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,840
so i just verify if the show mask

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,200
and the show point is checked if true i

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,880
just continue it

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,120
because uh i will draw these guys

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,559
but if not i just to continue the code

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,919
and i do the this this thing

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:09,200
i got some parameters here okay

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,960
like uh a face threshold

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,080
uh the the first pose okay remember

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,159
uh the here i'm guarding

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,159
i'm working with unique person in front

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,360
of the

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,640
the webicon so i got the per the person

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,600
in index zero so

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,720
i got the nose the left eye and the

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,919
right eye

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
here i just want to check if i have a

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,919
face

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
okay using the key point uh i can

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,399
implement

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
this in another way using my

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,640
segmentation but

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,200
uh here i'm adjusting uh i want to show

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,159
you how you can use the key points to

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,039
work and make some applications for you

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,240
you know

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:57,600
so i check if i have a face so

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:01,120
if i have a face i here

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,399
i'm filtering again i'm featuring my

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,600
my segmentation to featuring my lefty

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,440
face

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,559
and my right face okay so just remember

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,919
the data property is a big array

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,279
and in this big array we have the id

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:23,360
of uh it body part

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,960
inside each pair in inside each pixel

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,279
i guess it's a little bit hard to

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,279
understand at the first time

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:34,799
but here we have all ids detected

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,600
in an image so

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,039
here i will have a face array and i do

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,480
the same thing for

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,520
hand array okay so

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,279
i just convert this array

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,880
for a matrix because uh i

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:56,240
i need to use uh this matrix

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,679
for the tactic if my hand is in front my

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,520
head okay so i will compare two

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:07,200
metrics okay so inside this method

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,159
uh we have just a complex method

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
that i guess is not uh important to

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
explain

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,000
right now but here i'm just uh splitting

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,039
uh

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,159
array inside a matrix you know

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,760
by a limited

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:27,120
size okay so when i

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,960
i iterate by my array and when i got

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,559
my limit size i just crop this

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,000
this array in a new array you know

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,000
okay so uh

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,360
after that after convert my

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,039
array my data array my

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,320
body ids array to a matrix

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,840
i just intersect it so

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,039
i just pass for intersect method

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,840
uh phase matrix head metrics and

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:07,200
how much pixels i want to be

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,640
intersected okay so inside this guy

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,000
iterate by fixed pixels

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:18,080
okay so i iterate by

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,279
uh face pixels in x uh

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,320
issues and i check if my

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,519
uh face pixels is

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,240
uh is about some body part body peaks

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,960
you know because when you have when we

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,279
have

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,720
-1 it's uh it's mean that we have

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
a a black pixel you know like we don't

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,480
have

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,360
anybody body parts there so

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,480
if i have something there i just

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,840
iterating by

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,960
some uh some

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
some pixels you know like here i had my

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,440
padding

00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,880
i iterated by some block of pixels

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,640
and i check if my hand pixels at the

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,519
same position

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:10,559
is uh greater than -1

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,240
or it's uh

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,519
my hand pixels in the same position but

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,200
in the in this block part is

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,399
uh is minor what mine

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,039
is greater than minus one so it's

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,480
signifi

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:32,240
it's mean that we have a

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,279
drag score of my of my intersection

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,080
intersection okay so here

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,880
i just to check if my intersection is

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,080
greater

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,279
than uh 10 percent

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,159
so if true i just blurt

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,039
my face and how we can do it you already

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,960
see it

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:56,080
in these lights so we have my body parts

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,080
the left face and right face we have our

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,440
blurred amount how much

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,559
amount how much i want to blur my face

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,720
okay my edge burn so

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,640
how much i i want my ad are blended

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,760
and i ask for body pics to blur my parts

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,000
passing my video here just remember we

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,120
are

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,640
working with a video here and past my

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,760
canvas and all

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,039
parameters as you already see it said

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,799
before

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,159
okay so um

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,200
in the final we have this result

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,120
okay so i just check if my

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,480
hand in front my face i can use other

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,399
information to blur my

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,000
my face like qr code or like

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,440
some other uh input i can

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,159
segment the segment my my body here i'm

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,440
filtering

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,480
my hands and my

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,200
and my head but i can just print all my

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,399
body

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,000
okay and i can't detect my key and

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,720
i can show my key points just to

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,760
got some information for example you

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,200
want to

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,679
make a yoga application

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,399
and you need to know the position of the

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,079
person's

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:24,320
you know you will use the key point

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:26,960
uh and so i guess we can

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,320
uh go to the key in session and thank

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,800
you very much by your

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,440
presentation here and any questions that

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,720
you have

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,879
that you don't think in the kingway

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,919
session or you do know you can't do

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,119
right now you can just contact me at my

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,240
social media and i will be

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,200
uh uh it will be amazing to

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,399
talking with everyone about your

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,159
questions

00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:02,830
and help you in your projects okay

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:07,429
so thank you very much guys

00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,429
[Music]

00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,670
[Music]

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,440
and so we're waiting for a few questions

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,359
to come in from the audience but i do

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,720
have one or two that i jotted down

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,560
um if we're happy to dive into those um

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,040
it sounded both a complex

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,480
and a simple project to do if that makes

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,480
sense it was a complex thing you were

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,119
trying to achieve but it sounded like it

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,599
was fairly

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,880
easy with tensorflow to get it up and

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,760
running is that

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,760
fair to say

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,000
sorry so

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,960
doing exoskeleton mapping is a complex

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,440
thing to do

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,560
full stop really isn't it and it seemed

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
like tensorflow

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,000
made it much much easier than it could

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,480
have been

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,760
yeah um yeah the the tensorflow

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,200
is focused in two publics we can

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,760
use the tensorflow 2.0 that is

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,359
more focused in the developer you know

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,560
the developer experience to build

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,960
applications

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:26,480
done with no need no

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,880
deep learn you know and don't need

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,560
know the method learn don't need know

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,920
how you can architecture

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,240
a diplomat model but if you

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,040
are a data scientist you are a

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,520
researcher

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,240
and you need to build the model from

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,440
scratch

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,400
you can do it with tensorflow and

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,240
today we have the tensorflow or the

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,400
original texture flow is in c

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,440
plus plus and we have a big

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,800
a big wrapper in python

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,920
and these two wrappers is these two

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,079
versions

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
is the most complete versions and is

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,400
most recommended

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,720
for that researchers and data scientists

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,599
to build your model from scratch and

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,839
build complex

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
model you know and we have another

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,079
options like

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,119
uh tensorflow.js that we that

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,800
you can build complex model too

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,560
but it's not super covered like python

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,599
rc plus plus

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,400
and the javascript uh the texture

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,920
flowing javascript

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,640
have some high level package to work

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,800
with some prep builded modules you know

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,119
so it's interesting to

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,240
when you are working in a team that

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,640
don't know

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,280
so much about data scientists and you

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,880
want to

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
make some applications some cool

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,760
application that use deep learn

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,359
so you can use the tensorflow.js the

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,640
pre-builted models

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,680
from thingserflow.js okay have you got

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,720
any experience of

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,640
other ml libraries or is tensorflow

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
for me the things are flow we have

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,839
another libraries

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,960
in in javascript too uh i

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,440
i don't remember the name right now

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,880
because

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,839
i in my previous two years working with

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,400
computer vision

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
i just worked it with pythort and

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
tensorflow

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,599
but the tensorflow it's the most

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,400
tensorflow and python

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,520
is the most complete libraries focused

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,880
in deep learn

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,920
and the tensorflow it's more near from

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,560
the not data science developer you know

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
okay the pythart is a little bit focused

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,040
in researcher

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,800
so it's in python don't have

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,240
a js version and it's to build

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,160
complex and robust diplomat models

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,920
and the tensorflow is it's divided

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,359
in researchers and developers so today

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,119
we have another libraries to work with

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,400
computer vision and work with

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,079
machine learning but all libraries is

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,280
abused by the community and the most

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,359
uh robust diploma

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,119
library that we have today is the

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,320
tensorflow it's for

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,359
for js you know yeah is that just

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,599
because it's

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,720
used so much that's why we've got more

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,720
models to go with it

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,200
uh yeah things are flow have you

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,720
can just go in the tensorflow hub

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,000
and verify check for the

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,040
the rebuilded models that

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,720
train its models download it and use it

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,040
for example here i'm using the body

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,839
picks the body fix this is a library

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,920
uh that use the tensorflow but you can

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,800
use the texture flow

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
download the model from texture flow hub

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,960
load it

00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,079
and put an image like a

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:04,079
input and got your output

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,440
and it's um it's awesome because

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,000
it's run in javascript and but

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,720
you can use a pre-trained model from

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,319
python

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,319
and convert it for js so when i

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:21,440
was working with tensorflow.js

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,280
i i have two quite two years of

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,960
experience with tensorflow

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,520
python and six months working in

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,640
one project with tensorflow.js and it's

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,520
awesome because

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,240
you can train your model in tensorflow

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,200
python

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,000
and you can got all the resource of

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,960
tensorflow

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,520
python and you can just got your final

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,119
model

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,720
converted to javascript and consuming it

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:53,680
in javascript you know so you can just

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:56,880
make some easier api or

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,000
or use some developers that don't know

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,520
python

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,720
just know javascript to build uh

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,400
applications that use a a model that was

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,760
trained in python

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,240
so sorry no no

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,680
don't worry it's super it's super hot

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,119
here in brazil

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,040
i guess it's something like 30 30

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,440
degrees wow that is quite hot

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
no wonder you are sweating profusely at

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,720
the moment

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,800
and it's 7 p.m right now oh nice well

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,960
for comparison in my office under the

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,560
studio like it is

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,880
it's only 23 degrees here unfortunately

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,079
oh it's awesome so we have we had a

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,119
question come in then

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,800
oh awesome is it possible to start

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,040
using this without spending tons of time

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,599
on learning documentation and how it

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,440
works under the hood

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,520
okay do you need to understand the

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,880
detail in order to get something out of

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,240
yeah it's the most uh amazing part of

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,040
things for flow js

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,520
because we have two versions of sensor

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,040
flow

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,200
the one dot x and the two docs

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,160
two two dots x so uh when the tensorflow

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,359
becomes

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,119
in 2.0 version it

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:22,240
was focused in non data science

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,359
developers so if you don't know nothing

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,119
about data science you can

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,040
use these libraries you can use the

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,160
tensorflow.js because

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:36,079
the interflow.js has a great support

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,800
for that developers that don't know

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,000
about data scientist data science and

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,280
don't want to know

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,079
about data science so if you know a

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,880
little bit

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,560
about this area it's good because you

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,319
can configure it

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,920
your model you can configure the

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,560
parameters

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,480
but if you don't want to know you can

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,520
use the tensorflow.js

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,960
uh it's in a simple way and

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,839
it's in in javascript version if you are

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,920
using

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:11,280
it in python version you can

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,720
i guess i guess you will need to know a

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,160
little bit about

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,599
uh data science okay and let's say so

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,599
this is a question for me now because

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,359
i'm interested in this sure

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,480
let's say i want to have a play around

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,040
with it do you have a suggested

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,760
project that i could start with is this

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,000
because

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,240
computer vision is very difficult and

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,040
probably not the best place to start

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,160
with something like this i would imagine

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,280
so where would you suggest sure sure

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,160
uh i have the first surges is

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,200
working with a classical computer vision

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,480
uh

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,359
for example is not necessarily use deep

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,119
learn

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,240
but just using uh processing you images

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,200
or computer vision using opencv

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,200
you know opencv

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,359
opencv is a library builded by

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,440
intel and i guess is the most family

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,480
it's the most famous library and the

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,839
most complete

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,440
library again for high level

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,599
developers and low level developers so

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:25,359
starting with opencv you will learn

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,720
how we can manipulate a video why

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,920
we use a while true inside a video

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,920
uh how you can crop an image or

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,839
do something like this because it's the

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,960
base for understand

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:42,480
how the model will consume your data and

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,680
you you will get on output

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,040
you know so understand how is the data

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,480
of an image

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,440
what is the air gpb you know

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,440
anything like this

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,400
so i guess the first step is learn

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,839
opencv

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,720
so with with opencv

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,319
you can learn in low level if you want

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,319
or if you don't want to

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,839
learn computer vision in low level you

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,720
can just lower it

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,720
in high level after that you can start

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,560
with the deep learning models

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,200
again if you want to learn this

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,560
in low level it will be a little bit

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,160
hard because you

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,720
you will need to be a data scientist but

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,280
if you don't don't want to do it you can

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,640
just

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:37,040
uh use the tensorflow 2 dot

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:40,160
x 2.0 2.1 that has somewhat

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,839
uh prohibited models and have an

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,000
easy interface to uh developers

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,920
you know yeah i think that'd be a good

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,960
thing not just for me for everybody to

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,040
do it's

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,119
this necessary necessarily isn't a

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,280
technology we can use

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,520
day-to-day certainly not for me but it

00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,560
is something i should know about

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,720
for when i can sure sure

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,480
i guess for me it's super important

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,599
because uh for example

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,040
um have some tools that we

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,640
can build for our life that we

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,040
uh if we don't know

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,319
about these topics that we don't use it

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,119
a day a day

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,280
we can use it for example here in my

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,880
house i have some difficult to

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,240
receive some packets so i jus i have a

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,680
camera in front of my

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:35,119
house that uh just analyzing if my

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,240
uh feedex car are arriving

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,680
and if true i receive a message in my

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,720
phone you know

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,960
brilliant so

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,240
no this technologies i guess is not a

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,839
day-to-day

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:53,440
uh technology that we we use but we can

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:57,280
do so much funny tools

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,359
for us you know yeah i think

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,119
where i'm gonna start and tell me if

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,440
this is a silly idea or not

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,400
um we've got two cats that visit our

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,319
house

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,079
one of them we feed because he's the

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,760
neighborhood stray and one of them who

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,760
just comes around for strokes

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,280
if it's the one that needs feeding we've

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,040
got to go out there if it's the one for

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,720
strokes it's not so important so

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,319
maybe i could set up a camera like you

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,240
and get a text message

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,400
when the camera yeah yeah you can do it

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,839
you can do it for example if uh

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:29,599
the tensorflow 2.0

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:33,040
we have uh in the in the high level

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:37,200
layer we have a technical colored

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,319
transfer learn so we have a builded

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,319
model that can in that can detect

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,680
many things can detect the animals

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:47,200
persons

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:51,119
can detect cars so you

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,280
give a 200 image from this

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,680
cat and we have so the tensorflow will

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,119
do

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,640
a transfer learn from this image

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,520
for this model so we we have

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,000
a model in the final we will have a

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,720
model

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,359
that can detect objects and can detect

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,319
your cat

00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,160
you know yeah i was talking someone not

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,400
too long ago and they said that

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,240
when you're building up your data set

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,680
for this kind of thing you need to be

00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,640
really careful about what's in the

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,079
background

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,680
as well um

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,760
you need to be careful of what's

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,040
changing in the background of the image

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,559
because the cap might be the same but if

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,079
it's in the same spot from the same

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,079
camera and the background's changed it

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,480
might be picking up the background

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,839
um is that true or does he not know what

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,319
i'm talking about

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,359
or do i not know what i'm talking about

00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,400
it's it's depends

00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,520
of your implementation for example if we

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,319
are using object detection with deep

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,680
learn model

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,720
the diploma model uh can work with

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,520
many contexts so it's

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,800
don't matter if you have a background a

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,280
complex background

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,920
or a simple background but if you are

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,319
working with classical computer vision

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,200
you will need to pay attention with

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,400
these

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,440
uh with these things so the difference

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,319
between uh classical computer vision and

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,200
the deep learn

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,680
is exactly this in computer vision is

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,640
super

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,359
much faster to implement the projects

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
and

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,440
it's super uh most uh simple to

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,200
implement

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,640
the project and but it's don't work

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,680
in every context you know if you have

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:39,040
uh image with many cats and your your

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,760
cats in the front

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,079
the computer vision maybe maybe it's not

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,359
will

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:48,720
detect your cat but if you using

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,839
deep learn you have a image with

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:56,319
many cats many cats in the road

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:59,280
uh many cats super similar with your cat

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,200
the deep learning will detect what is

00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,800
your cat

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,960
okay i've got a feeling you're gonna get

00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,119
a message from me very soon with

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,599
200 photos of cats attached to it and

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,240
saying why doesn't this work

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,760
um at that point i'm gonna say thank you

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,640
very much for joining us for this

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,319
q a and we are on our time now and thank

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,280
you for the amazing talk i certainly

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:27,839
learned a lot i'm sure

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:27,839
everybody watching did

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,800
