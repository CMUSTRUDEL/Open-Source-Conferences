Title: Reading Thoughts with JavaScript - Milecia McGregor - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	An important skill people in tech need to have is learning how to combine unusual, unrelated concepts into things real people can use every day. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and it has the capabilities to handle massive data streams quickly. Itâ€™s already being used in machine learning so why not take it to the next level and add neurology?

You can learn how a $500 EEG sensor module can be used to improve internet and technology accessibility for the disabled. Using machine learning, we can make predictions on what specific brain signals mean and map them to real world problems like controlling a car with your mind or being able to change the format of a website so you can peruse it without the use of an assistive reading device. By the end of this talk, attendees will know how you can use Node.js to handle brain signals and use them in an a way that makes huge differences for users."

[Music]

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,560
hey everybody

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
my name is melisha mcgregor and i'm a

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,679
developer advocate

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
at conducto so today i'm going to talk

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,480
to you

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,680
about reading your thoughts with

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,320
javascript

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
it's crazy but we're actually at that

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,440
point

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
and if you're interested in keeping up

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,960
with me and the different projects i

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,320
work on in this space

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
you should definitely follow me at

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,440
flippedcoding

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,160
on twitter and if you're having problems

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,920
with your ci cd pipelines because

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
you're tired of yaml you should

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
definitely follow

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,840
conducto on twitter at conducto

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
tech so i'm gonna go ahead and get

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,159
things kicked off with an

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,159
overview and we're gonna do a quick

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,520
background on some neurology

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,280
i'm not a neuroscientist so

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
don't worry we're not going to get too

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
crazy

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
and then we'll go over a little

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
background on eeg

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,119
signals then we'll go over

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
a little more background stuff on

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,200
machine learning

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,920
neural networks in particular then we'll

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,960
get into

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,119
how we map eeg signals

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,880
and then we'll talk about how you

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,960
combine eeg signals and machine learning

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
and the part that you guys are all

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,799
waiting for which is why i have all

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,320
these crazy wires on my head

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,600
is the live demo which i checked it

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,479
literally seconds before i started so

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,640
hopefully nothing broke in between now

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
and pushing the play button

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
and then we'll go over a few practical

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
uses of this after the demo

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,399
and we'll just wrap up with some key

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,600
takeaways

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,520
so jumping right into it a little

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,560
background on neurology

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,560
so this is a branch of medicine

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
that deals with your nerves and your

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
nervous system

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
and a lot of other brain stuff that i

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,959
personally don't

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,000
understand so most of the things we'll

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,879
be talking about

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
happen in your frontal and temporal lobe

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,519
so your frontal lobe

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
is where a lot of your like rational

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
decision making comes from

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
and your temporal lobe is where you get

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,400
a lot of your like

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,440
motor skills and whatnot so disclaimer

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,160
not a neuroscientist so

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
that's a little bit off i do apologize

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,920
but i did my research before

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
so right now neurology

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,840
is just having all kinds of

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
breakthroughs in society so

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
there have been some paralyzed patients

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
that have been able to

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
shop and text just with different

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
neurotech devices there are

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,480
brain controlled robotic limbs which are

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,000
really cool

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,720
and there's actually been one case

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,400
where multiple people played a game with

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,519
just their thoughts

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,280
and that kind of inspired me to

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,000
try to make something else in this space

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
so there's definitely going to be a lot

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
of

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,840
neurotech talk in the future i'm sure

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
you guys

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,400
have maybe at least heard of the thing

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
elon musk is trying to make the neural

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
link

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
so it's definitely something that's

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
simmering

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,000
in the background but a few things we

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,840
will be able to do with it include

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,159
advanced

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,680
exoskeletons so you'll be able to strap

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,440
into a robot suit

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,720
and move it around like it's your own

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
body

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,400
um we'll have communication via thought

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,519
so

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
telepathy is coming for you guys and

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,400
there is a chance we'll have

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,159
brain implants to improve cognitive

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
capabilities which

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,040
is a little bit wild and we'll get into

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,640
some ethical things around that

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,239
a little later so a little bit about

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,600
eeg signals that stands for

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,040
electroencephalograph signals

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,160
and basically it just takes

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,360
different electrical impulses that it

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,479
picks up in your brain

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,759
and maps them to different channels

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,919
so that you can record that data

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
but the primary brain waves that we'll

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,720
be looking at today

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,800
are the alpha wave which it is

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
responsible for things like

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,800
memory um a little bit of

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
your like mental coordination is

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
involved

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,080
things like that theta waves have

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,160
a lot more to do with dreams and

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
definitely a lot more to do with

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
memories but it's more

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
of a background type wave and then we

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,759
have

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
delta waves which pretty much only

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
happen

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
when you're in that really deep

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
dreamless

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,759
sleep that really good sleep at night

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,240
and beta waves are the ones we're really

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,720
the most interested in because these

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
are your waking thoughts so when you're

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
making decisions or you're trying to

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,880
solve a problem

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,600
your beta activity is really really high

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
and then this is just a map of some of

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
the points

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
where we put electrodes for these eeg

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
signals

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
and the ones that we'll be focusing on

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,520
today

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,639
are these two so fp1

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,240
and fp2 and i have

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,039
two behind my ears

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
you can see the little dot and there's

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,319
one on each side and those

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,560
are the t9 and t10

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
electrode positions and then i have

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
these

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,240
on my ears just as like a ground for

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
everything

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,440
so there are a few different ways you

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
can

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,400
interpret signals so you have the time

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,080
series where you just see the activity

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,960
over time

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,680
and then for the more mathematically

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,960
inclined or engineering inclined of you

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,960
we do have fast fourier transform plots

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
but one of my favorite ways is just a

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,039
visual

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
so the other two ways we talked about

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,400
are great for

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,440
recording information and we'll actually

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
be using

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,039
time series information in the demo but

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,360
this is just a way where you can see

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,720
which parts of your brain are really

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,039
active so at this point in time i guess

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,319
i was just thinking really hard on this

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,160
side of my brain

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,240
and the rest of it is kind of darker so

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,039
it's just a way to visually see where

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,880
some activity is happening

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,240
and if you are trying to

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,280
i guess really understand particular

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,919
brain waves there is there are

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
other apps you can use so this one shows

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,520
you that

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
you're focused because your beta

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,160
activity is low

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,960
and your alpha activity is high so we

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
all know that

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,039
beta waves are associated with

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,520
active thoughts so that problem solving

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
that decision making activity that

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
happens

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,360
in the beta frequency so when your beta

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
waves are low and your alpha waves are

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,919
high

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
that typically means you're pretty

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,440
focused on something

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
so i don't know what it was but

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,960
apparently

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:57,360
i have focused for more than two seconds

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
and now just to switch gears a little

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
bit we'll do

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,319
a little background on machine learning

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
so we'll be using

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
a neural network for this particular

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,879
model

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,599
and a neural network is just made of

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
nodes

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,080
and a node is just a building block so

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,599
you have a certain number of inputs that

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,440
you want to use

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,720
to make an accurate output

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,599
estimate so what you're trying to do is

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
take all of your input data train a

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,440
model with

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,279
it and get an accurate prediction for a

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,560
value you want to know

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,519
and how this works is each input

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
feature that you give to the model will

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,360
have a certain weight

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,600
assigned to it that tells the model

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,880
about how important it is

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,519
to the overall outcome but inside

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,640
of this neural network it's making its

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,080
own connections

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,480
and giving different weights to just the

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,279
other things that it formulates with the

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,320
data

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,959
so it goes through all of these

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,000
calculations

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,600
changing weights and it gives you your

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,600
predicted value this is

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,080
the foundation of how deep learning

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,200
works all deep learning is

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
is a neural network with more than one

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,800
node

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,760
so if you have two nodes in your neural

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,240
network

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,240
ha you were doing deep learning

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,680
so really all machine learning is is

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,959
just some programming that runs

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,080
a lot of calculations on really large

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,279
data sets that's the power in it

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,399
you can take millions of data points

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,720
train a model and accurately get

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,200
predictions for different values so

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
using the normal housing model

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
prediction thing

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
if you had millions of data points for

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
houses all over the world

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
you could probably accurately predict

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
the cost of a house

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,880
in your particular city or country

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,000
so now we'll talk about mapping eeg

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,240
signals in a way that's really useful in

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,519
a machine learning application

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,640
so what you really want to do is try to

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
focus on one thought at a time and

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
record

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
the frequencies that represent that

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,880
state of thought

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,880
so that takes a lot of trial and error

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
just to figure out what the different

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,920
signals mean in their various

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
combinations

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
but once you have seen enough of the

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
data you start

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,680
to kind of make correlations enough

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,640
where you can make an educated guess

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,279
so it does take some best guesses to get

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
started

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,839
because there's not a lot of open source

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,200
eeg data so a lot of it

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,240
will include reading through textbooks

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and even trying to get your own

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,920
like eeg system so you can have access

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
to that data

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,720
but one really important thing once you

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,320
get the eeg signals and you know how you

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,560
want to map them

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
you have to clean noise from those

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
signals

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,839
so our brains have a lot of background

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,959
activity

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
and i'm pretty sure you know because our

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
thoughts

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,800
wander so many times during the day and

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,839
even while you're really focused on a

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,720
thought there's just

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
noise that comes from these electrodes

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
trying to get through

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
your skull basically so you want to make

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
sure that you can clean

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,200
the noise from your signals and then

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
probably the hardest part is to get

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,160
enough

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,360
data to actually map frequencies

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,279
to a thought to get a large enough data

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,120
set to train with

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
so it took me probably

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,399
20 hours to get

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,680
four or five really good data points

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,040
not the whole data set but just a few

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,000
data points

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,240
so that's something else that comes up

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,200
when you're trying to map these eeg

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,000
signals to a useful thought

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,519
and then you're going to take whatever

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
data set you build

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,920
and this is what you're going to use to

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,560
train your machine learning model

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,320
so all of those raw thought frequencies

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,279
that you've generated

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,040
you know which channels are connected to

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,560
which parts of your brain

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,440
so after doing some of that neurology

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
research

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:56,480
you'll have a better idea of how to

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,480
choose features to map to your output

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,760
and then this is a question that comes

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
up in machine learning a lot so what's

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,399
the best

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,320
algorithm to use and that really depends

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,800
on what your problem is

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,880
if you're doing something like this i

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,480
personally chose to go with

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,480
a convolutional neural network just to

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,680
get all of the nuances that happen

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,959
in these eeg signals but you can

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,920
experiment with

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,839
all the different kinds of algorithms

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,800
another one i considered was

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,639
using an svm for this kind of model

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
and then this is my favorite part

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,880
getting to talk about brain js

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,680
so the reason i chose brain js

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
is because this is actually going to be

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
used

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,240
on a web app which is pretty awesome and

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,440
basically

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,040
what it does is take the

00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,079
processed eeg data

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,959
and it creates its own neural network

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,560
model

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,680
to filter those thoughts down into

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,240
directions on a web page so

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,720
the demo app that i'll show you will

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,839
basically let you scroll a page

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
with just your thoughts and it doesn't

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
sound

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,079
like that big of a deal but it's

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,160
really cool you can just move a browser

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,560
page by thinking about it

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
so brand js lets us do that really

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,760
easily because

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,760
if you know how to work with javascript

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,480
arrays and objects

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
and methods that's pretty much all you

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,399
need to do machine learning

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
with this particular javascript library

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
so something else we're going to do is

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,199
use our model

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,399
to predict the thoughts based on our

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,880
input

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,920
so this is going to be running and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
reading my thoughts

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,199
in real time trying to predict whether

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
or not

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,800
i'm trying to scroll up or down the page

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,839
or go left or right

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,040
and now is the time for the demo

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,920
so let's i'll just give you a quick

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
overview of the code so this is actually

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,880
what i'm running

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
to get the data from here i couldn't

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,600
quite do that with just

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,000
javascript so i had to run a python app

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
that processes the data in real time and

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,880
filters it

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,320
and cleans it up but after that

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
that cleaned up data gets filtered down

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,440
to just

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,480
alpha beta theta and delta waves

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,680
and we send that information to

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,000
our brain js model and this

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,199
is where the code really starts to come

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,759
in

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,839
so if you've ever worked with node we

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,120
just go through and set up a regular

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
node application

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,199
like starting our express app

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,800
setting some ports then we get to our

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,079
input data so we're officially

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,519
about to use the brain.js library for

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,720
machine learning and javascript and

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,880
all we're doing here is taking

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
a data set that i've generated

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,680
previously

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,040
that has the alpha beta

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
gamma and delta brain wave signals

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
really

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,759
cleaned up so these values

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,680
correspond to whether you're thinking of

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,320
up or down or left or right

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,560
and what we do with this data is combine

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,839
it to make our training set

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,920
for our machine learning model

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:47,680
and all this is it's just an array

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,480
of objects so we have an input object

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,959
and an input value and we have an output

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,320
value

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,759
in our rays then

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:02,240
this is probably the best part so this

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,360
one line right here is our entire

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,400
neural network this is how you build a

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,839
neural network

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,760
in brain js it's just one function call

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,760
where you define a few different

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,679
properties in this case

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
i've decided to go with three hidden

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,120
layers to give

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,199
the neural network just a little bit of

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,360
time to come up with some of its own

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,480
connections between the data

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,799
but that's not necessary and if you want

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,960
you can increase this number just to see

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,480
how it works if it changes the accuracy

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,440
or not

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
then down here is probably the second

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,919
best part

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,640
so this is where we actually train

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,720
the model we just made with our data set

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,640
that is all you have to do to use

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,440
machine learning in javascript and

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,280
that's

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,799
so awesome to me so now we have

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,280
our neural network trained and we have

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,440
these stats that print to the console

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,440
just so we see like how many iterations

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,160
it took the error margin things like

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,080
that

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,240
and we also do a quick run of

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,000
just test values to see what kind of

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,840
prediction we get

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
and then at the very end of course we

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
run the app

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,960
so what we're doing like the main part

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,240
where this gets to the front end

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,600
application

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,960
is we have this very small api

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,200
where we get the data that's streaming

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,640
from the eeg

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,320
and then we use the values that the eeg

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,679
model returns

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,600
to get a predicted direction

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,440
for the scroll on the web page

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,960
just based off of our thought

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,640
frequencies

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,160
and then we just send that value to the

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
front end so

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,000
now that you know how the back end works

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,520
i'm gonna go ahead

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,400
and start it there's really nothing

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,559
that's spectacular to show you here but

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,760
if you see

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,520
we have our predicted values so

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,799
based on these inputs for alpha gamma

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,640
beta and delta waves we see

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,120
this is likely to be a down direction

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
thought

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,240
because down dominates over the other

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,520
values

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,640
so now we have our backend api running

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,559
we have the brain api running

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,039
all we need to do is go through the

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
front-end

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,120
and this is just a really simple react

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,000
app it's nothing super

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,039
fancy but the part you're probably

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
interested in

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,280
is right here so

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,880
all this is is a function that

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
calls our api that sends us the

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,200
predictive value

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,039
for the scroll and what we'll

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,159
do is take that response

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,559
and if we see that there's

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,480
a value for up and down which usually

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,760
there will be

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,679
then we see which one of these values

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,240
has the higher probability

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
of being the direction that the user

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,400
wants to scroll

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
and then we'll scroll in that direction

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
for

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,799
about two seconds and then

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,480
we'll call this function again which

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,080
we'll call that api

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,440
which we'll call the eeg api and

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,000
get that value every two seconds just to

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,840
scroll

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,080
on our tiny home page

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,840
so home page really isn't anything

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,360
special

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,640
it's just not special at all so i'll go

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,679
ahead and run

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,600
the home page so that

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,600
we can see this in action

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,080
should be popping up here

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,280
[Music]

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,120
there we go

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,960
so i have everything started up

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
and it should be

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:20,799
loading any second now

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,679
oh i know oh there it is just a little

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,080
slow

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,240
so now it's going to start triggering

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
that every two seconds

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
and just to show you what this looks

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,480
like i'm gonna have to stop

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,360
talking so that i can actually focus on

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
a thought

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
which is really hard to do even on

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:45,840
camera like

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,840
in my house so watch the screen

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,640
okay so i know it looks like i did

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,840
absolutely nothing right there but

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,400
that's the point

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,360
i was able to do that little bit of

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,799
scrolling with

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,000
just some thoughts so one thing you do

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,280
have to keep in mind

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,159
with a model like this is that

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,000
a data set for one person might not

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,039
necessarily work for someone

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,120
else so my eeg data

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,120
probably wouldn't work for you because

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,720
our brains are just different

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,880
that's something that you have to keep

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,960
in mind with

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:44,720
a type of problem this personalized

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
but now that you've seen this demo where

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,960
actually i've actually i've improved it

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,600
since

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,600
i actually just fixed this like right

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,760
before this where i don't even need the

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,919
blinks

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,400
machine learning is pretty cool like the

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,400
python libraries have

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,640
just made some changes that made it

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
easier to process the data

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,400
and i made those literally right before

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
i started recording this so you don't

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
even need to blink anymore

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,440
but if you are just starting out blinks

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,240
are a really good signal because you can

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,039
clearly see

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,360
them in the eeg data but you don't

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,720
necessarily need them depending on how

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,440
you train your model

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,120
so i completely changed how i trained my

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,960
model before the talk

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
you know sometimes the best

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
breakthroughs happen at really random

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,679
times

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,320
but there are way more practical uses

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,919
for something this

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,120
crazy so we know there are a lot of

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,760
people that have

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
different disabilities that limit what

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
they can do with and

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,240
interact within the world and technology

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
like

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,039
this can really help give people a

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,080
better quality of life

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,200
so imagine if you were able to

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,080
go for a drive with just your mind like

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
you control

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
the gas the brakes and the steering

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,520
wheel with just your thoughts

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,880
that would open up so much access for so

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,919
many people

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,880
and that's just one of the ways we could

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,279
of course there's prosthetics there's

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,799
assisted learning devices for people

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,840
with different

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,880
like learning dis disabilities

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,880
and things like that so it's really

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,000
easy to use this to make custom

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,799
custom devices custom websites custom

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,520
software anything can be super

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,559
customized when you know exactly

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,400
what your user is thinking

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,600
and then there's other ways we haven't

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,000
even thought of yet

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,880
where neurotech can take us to the next

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,080
level

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,840
as humanity honestly just imagine

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,840
if you were in an er and your doctor

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,320
needs something but he can't quite think

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,520
of the

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,640
word for it but his assistant could hear

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,760
his thoughts

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,880
and get a better idea of what to he's

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
looking for

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,840
so things like that will take some

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
creativity and some time once we get the

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,080
hardware really

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,080
up to par

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,919
but i do want to take a second and talk

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,279
about how

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,760
important ethics are when you're dealing

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,559
with

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,360
people's sensitive data like their

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,480
actual

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,600
literal thoughts you really

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,799
want to make sure that this data is

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,080
being used to

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,679
help people this isn't just

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,279
to make brain streamed ads or

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,320
to do other just unethical

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,520
things make sure when you have

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,960
data this sensitive that you're doing as

00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,640
much as you can to protect it because

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,200
this is literally people's thoughts like

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
you don't get too much more personal

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,159
than

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,840
knowing how to break down someone's

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,120
thought pattern

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,159
make sure that anything you do in this

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,960
field

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,919
is ethically sound because if it isn't

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,039
that leads to so many other problems

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,159
and we really don't want data breaches

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,840
with brain data

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
so just a few takeaways always try to

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
find

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,880
uncommon ways to implement machine

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,840
learning and other tech tools

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,000
it doesn't always have to be some

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,559
ridiculous hard tech problem like

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
logistics or image processing it could

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,600
be

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
something else like trying to make an

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,799
air guitar which is something i'm trying

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,840
to do

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,559
but look for just creative ways to add

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,039
machine learning to things

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,320
and then use your advanced technical

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,200
skills for fun

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
you know how to code that has so much

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
access

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:09,039
you can make robots you can make

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,799
ridiculous eeg things you can make

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,640
so many different tools in games

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,720
and just applications so don't be afraid

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,080
to just step out and do something kind

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,760
of silly you never know

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,960
where it'll end up and also skynet is

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,960
inevitable

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,559
but with eeg data maybe we can make it

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,000
more friendly and super

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,159
custom to us so i hope that you

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,159
enjoyed this talk and i hope that you

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,120
learned something and that the demo was

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,840
cool

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,320
and again if you want to keep up with me

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
and

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,679
how my air guitar project is going with

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,000
all of this

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
follow me at flipped flippedcoding on

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,279
twitter

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
and don't forget that i use conducto for

00:27:51,279 --> 00:28:03,840
all of my ci cd

00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:03,840
pipelines now

00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,930
[Music]

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,440
so first off i just want to say that was

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
a brilliant talk

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,960
um i i didn't even know this was an

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,240
option for us to sit down and play with

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,080
my attention yeah i'm glad you guys

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,720
liked it

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,320
yeah and what was your biggest so this

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,320
is one of the questions that i just want

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,720
to ask what was the biggest surprise you

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,039
found

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,679
in working with it was it that it was

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,799
maybe easy to use or

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,039
honestly i was surprised at how long

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,000
it took me to figure out how to

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,840
understand that

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,279
data like it comes back just as

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,279
numbers so i figured maybe i could just

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,720
hey those numbers are different whatever

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
but no that was

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,840
the hardest part it was just getting the

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,760
data in the right format

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,159
is consistent enough

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:12,559
really yes so when i first started that

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:16,080
i tried using like kind of a reset

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,880
for i guess getting in the right

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,840
mindset for thinking about like up or

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,320
down left to right

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,320
so the whole time i was recording data i

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,159
was listening to white noise

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,000
just so it blocks out pretty much

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,559
everything around me so

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,440
it kind of acts like i don't know

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:37,120
putting myself in a box

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,480
yeah that way you can just focus

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,399
so the white noise do you think that

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,919
made a difference yeah

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,480
it helped me concentrate a lot faster

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,080
okay good tip good tip and so we have

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,600
had some questions coming so we'll move

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
on to everybody else's questions not

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,760
just mine

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,000
um so mikhail has said when do you see

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,200
this

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,240
becoming mainstream oh gosh

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,279
i wish it was now but i'm not

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,679
sure like the headset that i have

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,480
is not the most accurate and the ones

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,960
that do

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
better that don't require a brain

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,039
implant

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,480
they're fairly expensive so it'll

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
probably be a while before it's

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,399
mainstream

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,279
just because of the hard way okay

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,960
is is the hardware good enough do you

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,840
think to go mainstream or is it just

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
that it's so

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,799
costly to do it um

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,320
i think the current hardware is good

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,480
enough to go mainstream

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,080
is just really taking the time to

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,279
understand

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,640
neurology which not everybody wants to

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,399
learn neuroscience

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,840
so that's that's probably the biggest

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,919
like thing that's holding it back

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,440
okay and speaking of neurology our next

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,399
question is on the subject

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
do you think neurology and javascript or

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,520
other languages

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,519
could be used to detect mood or other

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,670
thoughts that could help with treating

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,919
mental disorders

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,960
[Music]

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,519
probably it would just take

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,399
some time to figure out like what

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,840
features

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,399
you should train a model for to detect

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,960
moods and i guess predict what they're

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,080
going to do or maybe what they should do

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,279
so i don't want to get too like deep

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,279
into people's brains

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,039
no you don't know what you're going to

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:30,720
find in there do you

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:34,320
no i don't want to know no

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,200
um do you recommend any specific

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,519
hardware to start playing with like what

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
can

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,440
where can people buy your headset for

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,840
example when you're using

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,640
so the one that i was using is from a

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,320
vendor called

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,120
open bci and they have some pretty

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,679
affordable

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:57,200
like eeg and emg sensors

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,200
it even comes with the software

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,159
is it on a real disc or

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,600
no not that real you can download it

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
sorry whenever anybody says real

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,279
software i always think it comes on a

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,480
floppy disk or a cd or something

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:15,200
yeah haven't seen one of those no

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,960
they no that's the save icon that's

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,200
pretty much the only remnant of floppy

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
disks left i think

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,120
um somebody has said that they think it

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,519
would be pretty cool to do

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,840
drawing with your mind is that something

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,919
that you've seen

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,640
done i personally haven't

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,120
but i think that would be a really

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,279
really

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,919
complex problem just because

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,720
thoughts are hard enough to process when

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,640
you're just thinking about one thing but

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,360
trying to figure out where a person is

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,360
thinking on a continuous path

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,279
i'm not quite sure how that would work

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,000
but maybe some neurologists are out

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,240
there that could help us

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,080
yeah and some javascript coders to do

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,480
the other part with you i guess

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,480
yes um so let's just see

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,080
i think we've answered all of the

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,080
question that's come in

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,120
um so what i'm going to do is i'm going

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,120
to wrap up here

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,559
but i'm going to if assuming that you

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,159
are sticking around i'm going to suggest

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,480
people come and find you on the table

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,559
and

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,240
really dive into this and that might

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
well be me because i've got lots of

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,559
questions

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,080
about this so i want to say a huge huge

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,600
huge thank you for

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,600
taking the time to put that demo

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,120
together and to record the video

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,679
um and where just if you could remind

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,559
everyone where can they find you online

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
um usually you can find me on twitter at

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,320
flippedcoding

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,679
so i post about the airguitar project

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,320
from time to time

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,720
if you want to keep up with that oh i'm

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,640
sure lots of people definitely did

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,000
flipped coding excellent so thank you

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,840
very much for your time everyone

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,080
else we will see you back here for

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,799
another q a in

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
i don't know how long but quite soon um

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,279
yes

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:07,840
so mika thank you very much for your

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,840
time that was brilliant thank you

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,440
