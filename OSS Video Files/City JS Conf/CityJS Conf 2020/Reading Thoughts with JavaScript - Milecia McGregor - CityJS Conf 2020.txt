Title: Reading Thoughts with JavaScript - Milecia McGregor - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	An important skill people in tech need to have is learning how to combine unusual, unrelated concepts into things real people can use every day. JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and it has the capabilities to handle massive data streams quickly. Itâ€™s already being used in machine learning so why not take it to the next level and add neurology?

You can learn how a $500 EEG sensor module can be used to improve internet and technology accessibility for the disabled. Using machine learning, we can make predictions on what specific brain signals mean and map them to real world problems like controlling a car with your mind or being able to change the format of a website so you can peruse it without the use of an assistive reading device. By the end of this talk, attendees will know how you can use Node.js to handle brain signals and use them in an a way that makes huge differences for users."
