Description: 
	Use Ai in your Website using Tensorflow.js

I will present how to make a digit recognizer using the MNIST dataset, all running inside a browser, I won't code it on the spot as it will waste time, rather slides will be shown with explanation along with the working app in the end, all under 10 minutes.
