Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	Which language do you like: ReactJS or Vue.js? During this talk I walk through the process of building a Tesla’s Battery Range Calculator with ReactJS and Vue.js. I compare React and VueJS with each other in terms of syntax, speed of development (number of lines of code & number of files), readability, maintainability, performance etc.
