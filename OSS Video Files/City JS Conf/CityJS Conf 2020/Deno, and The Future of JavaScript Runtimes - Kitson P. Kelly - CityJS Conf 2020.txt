Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	Deno is a secure runtime of JavaScript and TypeScript built in Rust.  I have been working on it since its early prototype days and want to share some insights with you on what the current state of Deno is and runtimes in general.  I will explain how Deno works, what the future of Deno looks like, and what sort of challenges and problems come with running JavaScript and TypeScript.
