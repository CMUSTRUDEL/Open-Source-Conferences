has been funded we got two million seed

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
round so that happened about february

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
and that basically just means that we

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
have some money behind us

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,360
to be able to pay people to work

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
full-time so that you know the two

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,159
founders

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,280
alex chopin and sebastian chopin don't

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
have to be going out

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
and doing workshops and other things

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,479
just to you know pay the bills

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
so now they can focus completely on

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,680
nooks and also get an amazing team

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
behind them

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
to help nooks grow so that's kind of

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,040
just it's really really cool

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,400
so since the funding since february

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,560

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
ambassadors

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
these people are responsible for helping

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
us to nuxtify the world

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,240
so welcome to these amazing people

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,759
you've probably seen them

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,680
already if you're not already following

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,600
them you should definitely follow them

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
and we have a teams page so you can see

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,759
who are the cool people that are working

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
out next as well as the maintainers that

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,720
are helping us maintain

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
and they're doing an amazing job as well

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,879
and then the ambassadors that are

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,720
helping us notify the world

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,239
we also have a blog so if you haven't

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,520
some really really cool articles

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
for example the nook static improvements

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
or create a blog with nooks content for

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,599
example

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
obviously i wrote it so it's amazing

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,360
right no seriously

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
do check them out and we are adding new

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
content um as much as possible

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,680
the blog is written by the nooks team

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,879
the nooks maintainers and the next

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
ambassadors so

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,480
it's a very good quality content

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,720
now if you want to write blog posts for

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
us uh we would love to feature them in

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,640
our newsletter we are sending out a next

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
letter every month if you haven't

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,000
already signed up

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
then i highly encourage you to sign up

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,959
and we've been featuring a lot of

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,239
ambassadors there

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,519
and a lot of other people have been

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
creating like really really great

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,280
articles

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
we also have showcases in there so we've

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
been kind of like

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
showcasing like sites that are built in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
nuts if you want to see what people are

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,000
building

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
with nooks js this is a great way to

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
find out what they're doing

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,319
and we show off modules and other things

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,159
that have been happening

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
throughout the month in next so

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,680
definitely encourage you

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
to sign up for our next letter comes out

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
at the very end

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
of each month so still have time to sign

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,760
up for the september one

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,760
just around the corner our new docs

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
our new guides are now live so we've

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,400
been working really hard on the

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,480
documentation

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
our aim is to just make it better make

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
it easier to understand

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
and um so more people can come on board

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
and not just

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
uh learn nooks from the start or like

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
you know have skills and nooks and just

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,440
need to find things easily

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
so um it's got a better sign there just

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,080
beside it

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
and that's the new guides we've kind of

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
split it up into books so this is our

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
intention right the first book is get

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,680
started

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
you're new to nooks this is where you

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
want to go and you want to start reading

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
through the installation the routing the

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,040
directory structure

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,959
and the conclusion if you want to

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
div dive a little bit uh dive a little

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
bit deeper you can go to the concepts

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,319
and you can uh learn about the next

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,640
context for example

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,840
uh we've also got features the directory

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
structure so that's like what your

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
project would look like

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
and it has you know a chapter for each

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,959
folder that would have been created if

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,120
you were creating nooks with like um

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,400
create nook stop for example so that's

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
really cool and then we have the

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
glossary which would be your old api

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
section

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,479
so just to kind of like you know learn a

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,680
bit more about how things are working

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,440
you can check those out as well um we're

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,400
using the the content module for this as

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
you can see it's

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
it gives us a lot more uh structure

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,600
because on the right hand side we now

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
have a table of contents which means

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
you can see at all points what's going

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,840
on in the page and you can quickly

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
scroll down

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
to what you want to um look at

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
so yeah we've been working really hard

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
on this and the idea is that the guide

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,120
in the api is going to disappear very

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
soon and the guides will take over

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
so do check them out and do get used to

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
them because they are the future of our

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,440
docs right

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
um we've also done some really cool

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
things with the documentation we've

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
added a lot more code sandboxes

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
so if you haven't looked our docs

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,039
recently you probably see like

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,320
loads of these code sandboxes and do

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
check them out a lot of work is being

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
put in them and they're very very new

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
they're all functioning and it's just

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
another great way

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
of learning with nooks playing around

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,919
with nooks and seeing how things

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,919
are working we've also been very lucky

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,639
to have an amazing talented ambassador

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
on board

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
who's helped us with these really really

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
cool designs

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
so you might see a few of these around

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
the documentation and hopefully we'll

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
have more

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,160
that will help you in a graphical way

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
just understand and some of the things

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
that of knox for example the nooks

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,840
plugins

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,240
where as you can see here it's just

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,479
beautifully um explained

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
so yeah more of those will be coming

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,120
soon i hope

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,560
and yeah hope you enjoy looking at those

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
and don't forget you can download them

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
as well and add them as a screen saver

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
or whatever

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,000
if that's going to help you um as far as

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,240
the docs are concerned

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
we have documentation in english spanish

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,880
almost it's it's almost there we're

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
about 95

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
translate portuguese which was

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,560
translated literally

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,520
um two weeks ago and is now live so it's

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
fantastic

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
um help you set up an issue and get more

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,680
people on board

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
to help the help you translate so it's

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,400
not just one person translating right

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,000
um it's been really incredible the work

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,680
that's been done by the community

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
as far as the translation is concerned

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
i'm so excited i can't wait to launch

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,479
the spanish version

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
especially as i'm living in spain and

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
i'm thinking wow the nook stocks are not

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
in spanish

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
crazy so it's almost there we're almost

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
ready to launch the spanish version

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,479
so uh do check out that now if you're

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,440
interested in helping us out with

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
translations

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,520
i've created a projects board inside

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
the noxjs.org repo so just go into

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,400
github

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
under nooks and find nooksgs.org and

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,319
then click on projects

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
and this one is the website translations

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,560
so you can kind of see here

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
what's going on the indonesian one is 11

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
and 91 done for example

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
um the spanish one of 67 of 91 tasks are

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
done

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
and you can see at what stage the

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
translations are going on you can see

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,479
what's being translated

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
what hasn't been started what um has

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,000
never ever been done

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
and you can then help to contribute to

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
that um

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,800
and let's help just you know make the

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,479
docs more accessible to more people in

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
the world that would be fantastic

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,000
so yeah do check that out and um help us

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,319
translate

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
and talk to me if you want to add a new

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
language

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
now i've also created a board for all

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,160
the like issues so if you're out there

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,840
thinking

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,360
you know this is missing so i've been

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
trying to work with this and i haven't

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
got the documentation i don't understand

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
it

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
or something is not there or you'd like

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,879
to see more of something else

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
you know you are more than welcome to

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,000
create an issue and don't worry about oh

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,440
is my issue good enough

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
will it be accepted don't worry about

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,919
that because i have a column called in

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,160
discussion

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,759
so when you create it it's going to go

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
into discussion first of all and then

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,319
i'll kind of look at it and check it out

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
and say oh

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
we're actually not going to do that or

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,840
we will do that or

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
maybe something's already created and i

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
might answer you with a link to

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,319
something

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
but basically just you know feel free to

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,360
open an issue

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
and add in what you think is missing or

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
what you'd like to see more of

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
and then you can follow along and if

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
it's in the to-do column then it's kind

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
of like you know programmed i'm pretty

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
much going to work on that

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,839
um in the next week for example if it's

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,360
in progress well there

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
it's being done like as you can see the

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,959
modules uh diagram improvements we've

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
been improving those

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,080
so the modules um the diagrams

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
can be translated as well so before they

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
were just um like a png

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,839
and now they're actually the raw file is

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
included which means translators can now

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,880
take those

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
amazing diagrams and translate them if

00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
they want to and then in their version

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,959
they're going to have the translated

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
version which is kind of really cool

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
especially for

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
languages like japanese where your

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
characters you know are just completely

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
different and you're going to find it

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,880
very difficult

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
to understand those diagrams so being

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,959
able to translate those is great

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,480
so yeah as you can see this board you

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,000
can follow it or check it out every now

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,040
and again see what's going on

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,640
and um also we kind of put in

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,040
labels on these for you know help wanted

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
like we did in the translator ones or

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,760
first-time contributors so if you're a

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
first-time contributor and you're kind

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
of thinking

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
i'd like to do one of those you know

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
look for the labels that's a first-time

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
contributor or help wanted

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,519
and um yeah more than willing to accept

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,480
help with any of this

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,240
now i've also created a nextjs.org

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
website now it's the website not the

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
framework with the website

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
uh roadmap so this is just kind of so

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
that you can see

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,240
where we're going and what we're doing

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
so we have a lot of ideas we have a lot

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
of things that we're going to be doing

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
um and now it's just a matter of

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
planning out when we can do them in what

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
quarter we're going to do them

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
and yeah you can kind of look along here

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
and say oh right there

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,440
for example in the fourth quarter

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,959
they're modifying the partner pages

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
uh releasing the translation of blue

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,279
languages for new guys there's a new

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
blog post coming

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
there's update the modules uh to use new

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,800
content theme for example so

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,079
all these are being done and you can see

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,279
what's in the to-do column and then you

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,440
can kind of say

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,800
oh they haven't even thought about this

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,839
and sometimes we don't think about

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,920
everything so yeah

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
like create an issue and say hey i see

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
that you haven't got this and we'd

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,800
like to have some more documentation or

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
some something like this on the website

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
that's not there

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
and it's just a way as well for you to

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,160
follow along and see what's going on

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,760
so yeah our website is now got a new

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
architecture we re-architectured

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
everything

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,240
so if you had been looking at the um

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,760
source code of nooksgiz.org

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,839
in the past you'll probably see it's

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,279
completely different now and do check

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
check it out like it's open source so

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,600
feel free to check it out and dive in

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
there and

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
see what we've done it's definitely not

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,079
perfect so if you see anything any

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
mistakes or anything

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,760
feel free to create a viewer and help us

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,720
make it better but yes a new

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
architecture

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,079
we're now using the content module so

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
we're a perfect example of how content

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
module works

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
so um check that out and you can see

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
like yeah how we do what we do which is

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,720
good

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
right

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
so we're always also using nux version

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
2.14

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
so in the latest version of nooks what

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
was released well

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
what we released were auto imports of

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,920
components

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,000
now this is kind of like you know really

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,120
cool really like this because now you

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
don't have to

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,880
add import statements for your

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
components anymore now i just love that

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
because

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
i don't want to have to write all these

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
import statements and then components

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
and then

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
you know add them all out now you might

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,839
want to and you still can do that if you

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
want to you just want components full so

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,200
you don't have to use it

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,880
so don't be forced to use it but it is

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,440
great it really does tidy up your code

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,920
and it's very good for fast development

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
so

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,760
yeah um that's just cool smart generate

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,360
this is my favorite right so any of you

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,760
who are building static sites in the

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
past and haven't been using them lately

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,720
you would have remembered just using

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,639
nooks generate and then it's going to

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
generate your whole site

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
then you change something a little bit

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
of content and then you do next generate

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,839
again

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
and it's regenerating your whole site

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
again and it's rebuilding everything

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,600
and i have various like fights and stuff

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,959
with people in offices you know

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,639
where they were like oh it takes too

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,360
long and why do i have to wait so long

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
just to like

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,079
generate the whole site why do i have to

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
generate the whole site if i just

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
changed one thing

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
and you know yeah in a way i hate saying

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,959
it but they were kind of right

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,519
why did we have to do that well now we

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,000
don't so with the smart generate of next

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,600
version 2.14 we can now generate um

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
basically we know if it's only your

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,480
content that's changed or if you've

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
changed like the architecture like the

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,240
view

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,839
page or some javascript or some css

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
if you change that we need to rebuild it

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,240
right because you kind of change the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
architecture right

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,760
but if you only change the content if

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
you only change the furniture in the

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
house we don't need to rebuild a house

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
right we just need to

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
take in and out the furniture so

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,360
basically yeah

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,279
it's gonna cache the build the first

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
time and if nothing else changes only

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
content

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
say coming from a cms from an api or for

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
example

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,880
in your content folder um markdown files

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,639
then

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,760
it's just super lightning fast it's just

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
going to generate it's really really

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,240
fast

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
so cool it doesn't just skip sweatpants

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
we're back don't need you buying i'm

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,680
just going to generate the content so

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
that's great

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
and there's also a crawler right do you

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,560
remember

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
the days i'm only talking a couple of

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
months ago but do you remember the

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,279
days when we used to have to write that

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,959
massive function and map over

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
all our pages just to try and get like

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,880
our roots you know so you could

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
um have dynamic roots so dynamic roots

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
now

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
bang done crawler there's like a little

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
tiny crawler it's called a nux crawler

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,639
and he's crawling

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,920
every single link and anytime he finds a

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,639
link he generates

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
um that page so unless you've got like a

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,519
secret page which is like nobody can

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,120
ever find because it's you know

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,639
secret then that's not going to be

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
crawled and you need to like add that to

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,560
the roots to manually generate that

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,320
other than that the crawler's going to

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
find all your pages you don't have to

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
worry about it and i think

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
that's amazing it's it's a lifesaver and

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
there's a live

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,680
preview what is live preview this is

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
really cool so you have a live preview

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
um

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
which basically means i'm going to use

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
an example here

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
um hasura right so if i have my content

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,680
in hasura

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
in a database and i want to change that

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
but i'm not sure i want to actually

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
build yet i want to make sure

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,000
things are okay so i can modify in the

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,279
database and then i can go

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,760
and use um a query param of preview true

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,279
and then i can see what's been modified

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,079
in my database i can see what it looks

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,079
like in the page

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,839
and then i can decide to regenerate the

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,360
site so that's really really cool

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,720
feature there's a whole article on that

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,519
as well so do check that out if that's

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
new to you

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,199
um yeah it's one of my favorite features

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
it's just great

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,360
love it so yes with the docs what are we

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,720
working on so we're going to create a

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
new resources section

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,800
so that's going to be coming soon and

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
the idea is to like have a modules

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
and examples section so many people have

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,600
been reaching out to me and saying

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,279
you know what are the official nooks

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,839
modules which modules can i use

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,120
and it is sometimes hard to try and find

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
them right and try and find the right

00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
ones so we're creating this really

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
really cool

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
and easy way of finding modules that we

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,600
on our website

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
and then you'll be able to just go

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,880
through them and if you've got a module

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,320
you want to add to it

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,399
and it's like you know up to the the

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
standards and passes everything

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,920
then yeah we're happy to add that as

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,519
well so we'll be monitoring as well

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
which modules get added there to make

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
sure

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that they are being maintained and that

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,199
they are of good standards etc

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,959
and it's just going to help you in

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
choosing which modules you want to use

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,720
and some examples as well

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,399
and this is like when is this going to

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,240
be finished this is like you know

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,839
um it's never ending right because

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,279
there's always new examples and there's

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
always new modules that are going to be

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
added

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
but it's going to be a really cool

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,560
section once it's there and

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,880
can't wait can't wait to release it it's

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
almost there so we're yeah we're halfway

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
there

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,360
um next quiz this is coming out this

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
month i am so excited about this we

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
built a quiz to help you learn nooks to

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,199
help you

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,720
to test your knowledge and see if you're

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
really a nookster right

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
um it's just a simple quiz and there's a

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,279
couple of answers there i try and trick

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,199
you out as well

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,759
and uh yeah the idea is just at the end

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,279
of each chapter of every page as a quiz

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
and you know it's just for fun just take

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,000
part in it and um that will be released

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,440
at the end of the month we're just

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
finishing working on that but it's

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,079
it's almost ready nook's videos we're

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
going to have videos coming out soon i

could be like november december january

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
but um we are working on them and what

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
we want to have is like

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,720
we want to create videos for you uh to

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,240
be able to learn nooks

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,399
so that you can actually just you know

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
it's it's learning how next is working

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
and on the

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,759
every documentation page there'll be a

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
code sandbox there'll be a quiz and

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,560
hopefully a video as well

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
so you can watch that and kind of see

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
how things work um

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
our aim is to make uh nooks accessible

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
for everyone in the world

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
to be able to learn and yeah we want

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
more people on board more people using

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,519
nook so everything we can do

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,360
to help make that happen uh that's what

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,360
we're doing so love your feedback on all

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
this this will be great

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
as for the website so this is we have a

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,040
new design coming like seriously it is

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,759
amazing i can't even show you because i

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
would be like

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
um spoiling it for you all but yeah we

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,480
have a whole new design coming it's

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,720
really really good

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
we're gonna be doing a lot of work um on

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
the website making it cooler we're gonna

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
be adding

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
so many new sections and stuff um so

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
that for example

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
you know when your manager says why you

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
know why should we use nooks and you

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
need something to say hey because of

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
this

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
well we're going to have that for you so

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
that's coming soon we're going to have a

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,079
lot of

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
sections like discover section and a lot

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,439
of content and uh yeah like i said

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,280
um coming soon so watch this space and

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,079
just watch out for all these cool things

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,799
that are happening more next modules

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,840
we've released

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,640
like so many modules um the last um i

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,200
don't know

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,679
the last month last week it's just never

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
ending

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,600
so i'm just going to quickly go over a

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
few of them so we've got nooks tailwind

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
um

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
you might have already been using this

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,559
but this was recently updated with new

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
documentation as well

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,039
so check that out that's the tailwind

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,160
css module for nuxed

00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:54,080
nuxcloudnary absolutely a crazy cool

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
module here for your images so if you're

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,360
working with images or you have images

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,960
on your website which most of us do

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
if you don't know what cloudinaria is do

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
check them out because um

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
it's actually free for developers it's

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,120
free for anyone

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
until you get your search certain usage

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
right i don't have that many visitors on

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
my website so i'm probably never ever

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,280
going to have to pay but if you have an

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,480
amazon website you'll have to pay but

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
like that's kind of normal right you

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
have an amazon website

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,440
probably rich so uh yeah start off um

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,840
with a free

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
account with cloudinary and test it out

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,200
it's really cool because this is um

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,559
before it was hard to integrate cloud

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
and everyone nooks because um

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,840
it wasn't working so well and it was

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
yeah it wasn't great and now with this

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
module

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
super simple and then you can add them

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
there and it's gonna like make your

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,160
images

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,440
um automatically smaller on mobile

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
devices and better

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
performant um it's gonna download a webp

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
instead of a jpeg

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,000
when you're on uh better browsers like

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,480
chrome for example so

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
highly encourage you to check that out

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
if cmss are your thing

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,440
we have a module for almost every cms

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,840
out there so

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,520
nook sanity access text images and other

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
media with nooks and the sanity headless

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,120
cms

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,080
nooks prismic easily connect prismic to

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,799
nuxt

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,760
nuxtrappy this trophy module for next um

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,400
so there's some

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
amazing cmss so you can check out any of

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,520
those

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
we've also got nooks storybook uh this

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
is great so

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,600
if you haven't heard a story book it's a

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,039
way of like you know design like a

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
design system for your component so you

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,840
can like

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
create them and um it's really cool

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
because this is really really hard to

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,080
integrate with nooks before

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
and now it's super simple it's like oh

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,799
my god it's so amazing so do check that

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
out

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,039
nooks pwa many of you who've already

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
worked with knucks are probably saying

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,640
um that's not new that's been out for a

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,000

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,559
updated to include workbox five

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
so a zero conflict pedobase solution for

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
nooks and

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,640
it's really really cool you can get a

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
progressive web app up and running in

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
seconds so

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,919
uh that's great next mdx uh if you want

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,679
to write jsx in your markdown with nooks

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,760
why would you want to do that sorry not

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,440
a jsx fund but yeah if you do if you if

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
that's your thing that's cool

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
i'm not going to judge you that's fine

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,720
you can now do it with the next mdx

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
module so check that out

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
but what i'm really excited about is

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,039
nook's content nook's content is my

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
favorite

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,440
it's like a git-based headless cms and

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,640
it's really really cool it's a really

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
really great way

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
of writing content and i'm going to dive

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,159
a little bit deeper into this

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,440
and i'm going to um tell you more about

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,400
it because i just love it so much it's

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,320
my favorite

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,679
module that's just been released so the

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,480
content module has

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
about 78 000 plus downloads at the time

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
of recording

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,880
and it was released in april you're

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,080
talking about in four months 78 000 plus

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
downloads it's incredible

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
it's just skyrocketed like we built it

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
for our website so we can write content

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,240
easily

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
and the world has just taken it on board

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,919
and we're really really proud of that so

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,080
thanks everyone for who has used it and

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
if you haven't checked it out do

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
so the content module is a git based

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,760
headless cms so for those of you who

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,080
were out there thinking

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,799
what is a git based headless cms let me

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
explain

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,880
but first of all i am debbie i'm a

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
fourth degree taekwondo black belt yeah

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,799
this is me at a competition

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
and basically what we do uh in taekwondo

00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,039
is we like to take people's heads off

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,880
right

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,559
this is really really cool i love

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
taekwondo this is um

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,000
yeah this is just cool this is what we

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,760
do take people's heads off why

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
because sometimes the body and the head

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,159
were not meant to be together i know

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,559
you're probably thinking

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,520
what on earth is she saying here but yes

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,360
a git based

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
headless cms so we want to remove the

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,400
head from the body

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
that's basically what we're doing we're

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,679
separating the head and the body now why

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,280
would you want to do that well sometimes

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,520
the head and the body were not meant to

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,720
be

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,840
together exactly you know so um if we

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
look at a taekwondo this is an olympic

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
taekwondo this is what you wear when

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,280
you're sparring

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,799
and this is like the blue one right so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,159
if you're going to fight blue the other

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
person's got to be red because otherwise

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
it's impossible for the judges to see

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,440
like

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,880
you know who scored a point etc so

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
when you've got the blue one on the

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
other person has got to turn theirs

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
inside out and it's going to be red

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
so basically um if you think about it

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,000
like this

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
we need to be able to change so we need

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,240
to be able to change our content we need

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
to be able to change

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
our front end so if you think of a get

00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,679
a mass is kind of like almost the back

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
in the front and you want to keep them

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
separate so they're

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,720
they are interchangeable so that if i am

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,000
now going to compete in red

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,760
um i can just change the head to be red

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,520
and then i can fight in that competition

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
i cannot fight with blue and red

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,760
um you could but not in a competition so

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
yeah basically that's what it's uh

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,039
it's about it's literally just

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
separating the the front in the back so

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,440
i kind of want you to think about it

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,520
like

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
the body is content right that's where

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,919
all your content is

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,880
and the app is your front end right and

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,880
that's the head

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
and that's basically uh what we're doing

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
here the content

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and the app are kind of separated and

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,640
then they connect each other by fetching

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
it right

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
now in nooks we actually have a folder

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,320
in there called content

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but if you were using a cms from

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,760
somewhere else that would be an api

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,520
ipi call and that content would be

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,840
somewhere else but in in this case

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,520
it's in our project so but it's so

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,400
separate this is cool

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
so basically when we talk about the

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,679
content module

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,600
um it's simple we basically want to say

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,760
goodbye to every other cms

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,960
goodbye wordpress goodbye storyblock

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,760
goodbye prismic

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,960
goodbye strappy goodbye sanity goodbye

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,679
every cms

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,039
what's next next content is going to

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
take over the world

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,960
seriously we are here and we don't need

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,799
any other cms anymore

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
and what do we need to do now in order

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,360
to make this happen in order to take

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
over the world

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
we just need to create git courses for

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,799
all the marketing team right

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,240
because now all the people who are gonna

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,240
need to you know

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
work with uh content work with data

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
they're gonna need to learn git

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
all the marketing team uh all the

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
managers we're gonna have to have git

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
courses for all the managers as well um

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
my mother is going to have to have a git

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,799
course as well because she's got a blog

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,799
and she's

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,039
now going to have to learn git get

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,279
courses for everyone i mean seriously

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,559
if everyone just learned git nook's

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,159
content would take over the world we

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,320
wouldn't need any other cms

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
brilliant and it's not that difficult

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,640
right i mean

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,080
you're like this is the git cheat sheet

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,120
right it's simple i can say to my mother

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,520
you know get config

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,279
a global username first name last name

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,440
she get that wouldn't she would she

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,360
um get add file name um

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,480
yeah i mean i can teach her i'm sure i

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,559
can teach you that

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,000
and oh we need to learn the terminal

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,720
yeah i need to teach them a term as well

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,240
oh my god my mother in the terminal

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,600
yeah i'm sure i could teach you the

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,600
terminal or couldn't we use like get

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,960
kraken or something or github desktop or

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
something i'm sure we could get around

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,400
that

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,880
on what what if there's a merge a

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,679
problem

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,120
um conflicts oh yeah you probably want

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,559
to call it a developer if there's a

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,679
merge conflict right because i don't

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
know if the marketing team and the

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
manager would be able to like

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,080
sort that out themselves yeah i don't

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,760
know i mean

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,279
oh come on come on we could just get

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,919
crash courses for everyone if we could

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,720
just teach

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
everyone git nooks content rule the

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,559
world

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,600
simple so there are two kinds of people

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,080
in this world right

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,760
there's the my mother type of person who

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
loves the big massive buttons

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,440
who likes to be able to see what they're

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,360
doing and knows when to press save when

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,400
to press open when to press

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,400
new window press save again um yeah that

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,159
kind of people and then there's

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
like other kind of people like me who

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,600
like to see all this code

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,279
and like you know try have to figure out

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,880
what's going on and just kind of like

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,120
yeah this excites me this is cool i

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,400
don't really want things to be so clear

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,840
and i mean there are those kind of

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,120
people that like the big buttons and

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
like this as well they're kind of like a

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
bit about

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
let's not talk about them right now so

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,960
content module

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,279
with a content module we have no login

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,799
there's no login there's no user

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,880
interface

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,039
there's no nice save button there's no

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,159
nice honey buttons

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:38,000
so what the hell does it have hmm

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,520
okay let me show you so next content

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,919
we've got our app and then we've got our

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,279
content folder inside our content folder

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,200
we can write in markdown

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,120
we can write him json we can write in

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,440
yaml and we can write in csv

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,400
i know i've lost my mother already gone

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,400
out the window

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,159
so yeah this is really really built for

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,279
developers and

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,440
it's going to help you write if you're

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,960
writing in march.json or yaml or csv

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,000
it's going to really really help you

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,840
and let me show you how it works so

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,200
if in our content folder we created

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,000
another folder called articles for

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,159
example

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,240
so we have articles and then we have a

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
blog post called amazing blog post for

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
example this is our markdown file and

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,159
let's write some markdown

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,080
writing direct and mark down in the

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,559
content folder very cool blog post that

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
is

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,080
and you know every post should have a

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,840
title and description so that's um

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,919
created using yaml those three lines at

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,640
the dot under above title under

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,799
description

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
that means this part of the page is yaml

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,360
so in here i wrote my title my amazing

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
blog post

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,679
and the description why using content is

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,240
amazing simple as that right so now i

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,600
have

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,720
uh this amazing post so how do we access

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,240
our content okay let me show you so

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
again remember we have our content

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,039
folder

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,640
in there i've created an articles folder

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,960
you could create a blog

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,760
folder or a post folder a my folder or

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,919
whatever you want

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
and then i've created my markdown file

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,159
and now all i've got to do

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,720
in my app in my front end part is use

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
fetch

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,679
i'm going to use fetch to basically

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,360
fetch the content simple as that i'm

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,360
just going to fetch the content right

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,640
fetch is to get so i'm just going to get

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,320
the content

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
like a dog you fetch a stick you throw a

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
stick and you fetch it he goes and gets

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,799
and he brings it back so it's basically

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,279
what fetch is doing it's going it's

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,200
getting it it's bringing it back

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,440
so how does it do that well this is the

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,039
code you would write so export default

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,880
uh we're using async data and we're

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,159
passing in dollar content let's this is

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
really important right because this is

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,120
how it all works so you want to put in

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,200
dollar content you're passing it into

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,559
context as well as the parents now

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,399
i'm passing in the parliament because i

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
want to work with dynamic pages if you

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,520
don't want to work with dynamic pages

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,960
um then you probably don't need this but

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,640
if you're working with blog posts it's

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,440
probably going to be dynamic so

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,320
uh this is uh useful and then i'm saying

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
constant article

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
i could call this what i want right

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,159
const page cons document const

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
uh plot post con's blog funds whatever

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,080
and i await that content

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
and what am i exactly wait awaiting i'm

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,080
awaiting inside the content a folder

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
called articles i call that folder

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,799
articles remember in the last

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,679
um slide you might have called it posts

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,360
or whatever

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,880
and i'm passing in the params slug

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
because that's the file name right

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,039
the file name is my slug and i'm

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
returning article which is the const

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,440
article

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,720
and when i return article that's my

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,200
amazing blog post

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
so that's basically what i'm getting

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,960
back

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,200
really really easy and now

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
that's it right no that's not it because

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,679
i've just fetched it

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,600
now i need to show it right i need to

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,679
show it on the page how do i show it

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
i show it using uh the component nook's

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,320
content now here it's like just in your

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,240
view page

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,919
using template don't be confused by

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,039
article that's just a html tag i could

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,480
have used a div

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,399
but what's important here is nook's

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
content right this is important

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,559
we need to use this component to be able

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,480
to get air our body

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
and we use um the document the document

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
is important as well so i need to use

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,960
document

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,320
and article is the returned object from

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,600
fetch right that's what we called it we

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,600
said const article return

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
article so now my document equals

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
article

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,559
and remember document this is what is

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,000
inside the body of the markdown file

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,679
right the markdown i'm not getting the

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,919
yaml stuff i'm only getting

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,279
uh what's in the body of the markdown so

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,159
writing direct and markdown in the

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,679
content folder

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,679
that's the markdown i wrote and that's

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,799
what's going to come back into this into

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,600
the document right

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,200
that's what i get back so that's cool

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,039
but you know what if i want to get like

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
the title and description how do i get

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,640
that

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
well very simple because we've called it

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,720
article

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,919
we have access to everything inside

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
article all the keys so we've got

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,760
article.title article.description

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
and i could have added an image in there

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
i could have added an alt tag i could

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,760
have added an

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,120
author or anything i wanted so you can

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
add as many things as you want in that

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,799
yaml file

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
and then you can access them using

00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,240
article.description

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,080
very cool hey so remember the title

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,120
description come from the yaml and

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,799
that's going to give me

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,279
what i wrote in the yaml title and

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,279
description

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,880
okay hope i'm not going too fast there's

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,960
more hang on

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
hang on i know it's a bit of a ride so

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,559
when i'm using fetch for example

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,240
i can decide i only want to fetch the

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,000
title so i've just made this a bit

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,679
bigger so you focus on it only

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,600
i'm using the only here i only want the

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,120
title why would i only want the title

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,880
maybe i've created a navigation for

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,679
example maybe i've created

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
um i don't know something like a list of

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,440
all the blog posts

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
so this is uh helpful in this way and

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,000
then you can sort that by

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,919
title sort by sending for example um

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,279
we can also do aware so it's using

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
lockydb under the hood

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,320
so we can do so many things and you can

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
check out the documentation for more

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,120
examples

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,480
but maybe we want to get only the author

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,799
name maybe we have a page

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,880
for each author so we want like when the

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,919
author is equal to like params author so

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
the authors debbie

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,080
only show the blog posts by debbie and

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,600
in this case we don't probably want to

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
you know have all the body we don't want

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,440
the mark time we just want the author's

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,679
name

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,679
and maybe the name of the post or

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,200
something so you can go without body and

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,679
then you're not going to get all that

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,799
um markdown being given back in the

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,279
fetch you're only going to get the

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,279
author

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,559
so that's kind of really cool so a

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,720
couple of features

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,240
uh previous and next so it gives you a

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
previous and next when you recommend

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,399
content

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,480
you know previous and next it's really

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,440
easy to use it's fantastic and i mean

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,320
that's really important when you're

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
creating a blog

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,080
or when you're creating documentation

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,840
for example table of contents you get a

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,360
table of contents just by creating

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,320
um h2 and h3 tags code blocks because we

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,960
all write in code

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,559
except my mother uh view components yes

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,760
you can write view components inside

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,000
your markdown you're probably thinking

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,440
why

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
would i want to do that well seriously

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
it's actually cool i wrote a quiz and

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,760
all

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,440
the um stuff is in the yaml right and

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,399
then i'm just using the quiz component

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,080
to get that

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,480
um quiz questions and answers from the

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,000
owl so it's kind of really cool

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,720
so what else uh you can style your

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,440
content very easily um we have like the

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,120
the class nook's content and then we can

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,240
add a search field so you can easily

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,640
search your data

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,840
and live edit this is like my favorite i

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,919
absolutely love this

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,279
so with live edit for example let me

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,480
just play that okay

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,399
well what we're going to do is we can

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,799
just basically you know run the dev

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,559
command and now live on our page we just

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,440
click it and we can start editing text

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,000
and then we like

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
um click off it we can go up for example

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
to the yaml

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,840
and we can start modifying what's in the

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
yaml the title of the description for

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,320
example

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,000
and then we just like click out of it

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
and then automatically we can see it

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,840
live we can see the changes live on the

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,519
page

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
and it saves it automatically in our

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,919
editor you'll see the editor you'll see

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,640
the page being changed

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
this is really cool a couple of snippets

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
as well

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
so on the documentation if you go to the

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
documentation we've got snippets for

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,200
search

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,559
for page nation for table of contents

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,159
and for dynamic routing

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,840
which basically means you can just go to

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,640
the documentation grab the snippet and

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,080
put into your

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
into your code and then you've got a

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,960
search feature so yeah we've done all

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,039
that for you

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,320
to make it easier for you and there's

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,200
more

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,919
what i know i know it's like the never

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
ending

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,080
nooks goodies right so yeah with content

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
we have the content

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,840
docs theme so if you're writing a module

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,360
plugin if you're writing something or

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
you just need some documentation for

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,480
something

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,000
this is incredible so literally all

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,000
you've got to do is yarn create

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,399
next content docs and add your project

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,640
names so it could be docs could be um

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,159
my plugin could be whatever and you can

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
add this to an already created

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,440
um repo so you might have the plugin

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,320
already created you just want to add the

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,919
docs folder

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,440
and you can just create it inside it

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,640
called the docs and then you've got the

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,080
docs folder and then you can build that

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
folder right

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,760
uh features what do you get so you get a

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,279
content folder this is what it gives you

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,720
it creates for your content folder with

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
some content in it and then you can like

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,799
just

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,399
you know add on top of it the content

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,880
you need it's going to create a static

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,039
folder

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,240
with some dummy uh images and a logo and

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,039
stuff but then you just put your own

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
over that

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,480
it's going to create a tailwind config

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,600
with um the colors

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,440
that we use and then you're just going

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,120
to put your own colors on top of that

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,559
you can easily add internationalization

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,159
it's all set up for you you've just got

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
to do some minor config and then you've

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,559
got like

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,000
a french or spanish or japanese or

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,679
whatever language you want

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,399
you can sort by category so you can have

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,519
different categories

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,880
it's incredible right out of the box you

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,120
get a table of contents

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,600
you get previous and next you get a

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,440
search you get light and dark mood

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
you get a link to edit the page on

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,399
github and you get the version and

00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
release notes that are coming straight

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
from github

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,559
what out of the box seriously yeah

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
you're going to get all this

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,000
just by just by yeah seriously it's so

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,560
cool

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,159
and there's more we even have components

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,399
so the components that come

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,480
including this an alert so you can have

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,599
like an alert with info or a warning

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,879
or a success one easily set up a list

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,520
a badge a code group a code block

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,879
code sandbox what yeah like the code

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,079
sandbox is cool so you can create a code

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,320
sandbox

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
and then you literally just add the link

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
to the code sandbox

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,720
and add the code sandbox component and

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,240
then bang you've got it let me show you

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,919
a few quick examples so

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,520
for example an alert you're just using

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,800
the alert component and you can write in

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,399
the text you want and as you can see

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,440
we're using a link inside the alert

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,000
using highlighting and it just works for

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,919
a list

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you've got some items you add your items

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,599
one two three you go list items equals

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,440
items and you'll see on the right the

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,599
beautiful tick and item one item two

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,839
item three so easily create a list

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,119
a badge easily create a badge for

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,280
versioning it's cool

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,480
that's all you gotta do code group i

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,440
love code groups because normally we

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,680
have like yarn

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,880
add and then next install it just takes

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,440
up so much space in the page

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,040
interactive click yarn or click npm and

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
uh then you have like the code you need

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,920
to copy

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,440
and use and this is it's fantastic and

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
then code blocks also come

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,520
with the um the file name and also a

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,040
copy so you can copy it so the user can

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,920
copy it right so which makes it

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
very user friendly code sandbox like i

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,000
said you put the link to the code

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,160
sandbox

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,040
and then you just use the code sandbox

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,480
component

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,640
and then make the source equal to the

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,280
link and that's it you now have the code

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,079
sandbox

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,560
live in your markdown page excellent so

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,000
yeah

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,079
it basically looks something like this

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
is an example and this is what the docs

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,560
theme will give you

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
so here's your logo then you've got your

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,680
search bar you've got your

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,160
twitter link your github link uh you've

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
got the

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,440
introduction page there uh the guys

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,119
that's a category

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,720
examples category you can just create a

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
category and then you can you know

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,560
decide which which one goes where

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
and over in the right-hand side you've

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,440
got the table of contents you can see

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
what's on this page and easily scroll

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,680
down to the video for example

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
um you can see that um list component

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,720
there

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
and yeah you also have this is it in

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,000
dark mode right

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,040
so it already comes with the light and

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,880
dark mode

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,560
set up you just have to let the user

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,359
click the button and choose whichever

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,800
one they want

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,040
and you can see as well at the end of

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,240
that the previous and next button so you

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,640
can go to the previous one

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,800
and the next one so really cool really

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,240
cool it's just like oh yeah this is all

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,800
set up and all done for you

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,320
it's so exciting so i know what you're
