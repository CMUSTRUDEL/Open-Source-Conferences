Title: GraphQL Accelerated - Matteo Collina - CityJS Conf 2020
Publication date: 2020-10-03
Playlist: CityJS Conf 2020
Description: 
	GraphQL is a query language that is rapidly gaining wide adoption across the community.
It combines type validation with a query and filtering syntax that makes it easy to get up-and-running with a powerful web API in almost no time. Features like running parallel queries or update-all become much easier, because they are first class citizens of GraphQL. Add to that a vibrant community that keeps creating excellent tooling and documentation,  it’s clear why GraphQL has become so popular with developers

Every abstraction has a cost, and GraphQL is no exception. The added complexity and a new schema format to parse and execute mean new performance bottlenecks. In addition to performance issues, the wrong use of GraphQL can lead to architectural bottlenecks. 

Instead of viewing this as a problem we took this as a challenge.

In this talk we’ll cover what GraphQL is, why it’s great and how we made it run a lot faster on Node.js, in fact *much* faster, using different performance techniques that we have learned in the last few years.
