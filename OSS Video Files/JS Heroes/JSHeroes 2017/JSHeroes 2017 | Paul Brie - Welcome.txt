	00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,680
I know it's kind of hard it's Friday

00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:19,599
morning 9 a.m. is something completely

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,650
unnatural for house developers it hurts

00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:23,540
so I'm really proud of you

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,840
it's great that they're here this

00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,210
morning and I think you won't be

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:35,480
disappointed we prepared something

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:39,440
special for you to start the day in good

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:43,040
conditions so I have to say that

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,030
yesterday near came to me and said in

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,370
Opel hope that is fine but the crowd was

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,140
not really engaged in the morning your

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:55,600
talk was not really inspiring so we

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,970
should try something else this morning

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:04,879
so I think he has a good idea and we can

00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:13,760
prepare something for you so near good

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:16,390
morning everyone um actually I want to

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,390
say a few words

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:24,560
thank you yeah

00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:26,980
thanks to my mom I know um I mean we we

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,920
are only having a really good time here

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:36,680
but you know not everything is okay with

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,260
the world so I want to dedicate these

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,380
things that we are going to do now for

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:49,520
those people out there who's still using

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:52,550
Windows or some events yeah that not

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,470
only for the windows people come with I

00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:00,530
mean every one of you can think of at

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,110
least one person that still you know

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:07,040
think that that's not going to be the

00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:10,179
next thing so uh yeah we're not talking

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,179
about PHP developers today

00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,190
but if you are working with 50 anyway so

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,080
this project the front the front and

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:24,790
Bandits project it's an open-source

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,450
project I started it in in Israel is

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:33,160
he's got a cause for all of those people

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:35,590
around us who had some issues and it's a

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,040
real band I mean if you're a developer

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:44,260
and you like music you can join you can

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,810

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:30,880
good friend who wrote the lyrics lightly

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:35,650

the morning scram okay so I hope this

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,390
was a good start for the day and they

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,570
are a bit more entertained and we got

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:25,440
your attention so we're actually excited

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,870
to continue the second day of conference

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,600
we have amazing speakers and amazing

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,620
topics I can't wait to hear what I have

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:39,780
to say I also wanted to share a couple

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,520
of thoughts before we get started they

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,890
have been a lot of discussions around

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,050
the the first day that we had here at

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:53,520
the conference and one of the topics is

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:58,890
related to the fact that javascript is

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:07,350
inviting to the idea of full stack so

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:10,560
it's it's interesting sorry oh yeah

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,300
somebody does the phone so if it's yours

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:26,360
take it back and water if you need the

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:26,360
phone take it is it an iPhone okay okay

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,460
yes so I'm coming to back to back to the

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,790
idea JavaScript invites to full stack

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:41,760
coding and I think this is an

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,590
interesting thing and I'd like to talk

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,860
about a friend of mine who's the

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:50,010
researcher and she works in some

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,890
abstract physical research in

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:56,670
friends and we had a discussion and she

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,370
was saying I'm working with some extract

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,750
models in like seven dimensions and I

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,000
was like okay was it is useful for

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,740
because when it goes behind behind three

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,230
is really hard for us to figure out what

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,610
it is then eventually we figure that

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,520
time is the fourth dimension

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,380
but then the fifth six seven and so on

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,390
starts to be really a bit abstract and I

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,590
was always remembered this this

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:27,450
conversation we had and I think as

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,430
developers when we start we always start

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:35,130
with front-end or back-end or DevOps or

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:39,000
whatever we start with Adam a dimension

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,230
and then JavaScript really opens towards

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,570
the opportunity to explore other

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,650
dimensions so I don't know how many of

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,940
you are doing back-end and front-end but

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,530
the less there is the hint of it is good

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:56,520
makes the blood running

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:59,370
so who does both yeah good job and as

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,590
you know if you tried it it makes you

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,700
think differently right

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:07,910
it's the same language but the patterns

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,480
the things you have to look at are

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,450
obviously different I also know that in

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,790
there in this audience and also some of

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,010
the speakers they doing also mobile

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:25,890
development with JavaScript so this is

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:27,570
yet another dimension and recently I I

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,960
spoke with Dan he is going to speak to

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:34,770
us today and Dan is doing yet a course

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,200
of full stack product development so

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:40,530
that was interesting what does it mean

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,300
full stack product development so full

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:47,010
stack product development in Dan's view

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:48,600
is know how to code on the backend know

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,940
how to code on front-end know how to

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,820
code on the mobile know a bit of

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,690
marketing know a bit of business

00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,380
development know bit of growth hacking

00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:03,470
know bit of market research

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,100
and then I could add our performance

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:10,310
might be interesting as well

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,260
non-functional requirements yeah if you

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,080
have some also some business knowledge

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:19,010
that's good too because if your product

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,770
works you have to run it and so suddenly

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,050
I just realized that in fact one of the

00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:28,850
challenges that we're having today is

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:33,350
that more and more we have to give up

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:35,480
the idea that we only developers even if

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,970
working announcer artist company we're

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,420
making services for others we can just

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:44,090
write code that does things this code is

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,070
running in a context this code is

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:50,630
serving the purpose this code my save

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,280
lives or improve lives hopefully then it

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,740
means before you write the code you have

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,780
to digest and to understand all the

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,770
context and the consequences and the

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,720
potential of what you're doing so I came

00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,700
back to this discussion I had with with

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,270
my friend and I thought that's

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,860
interesting

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:15,140
in fact we developers are oftentimes

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:20,300
perceived as being the ones who just

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:23,810
write functions or classes for some but

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,370
does not it most of us we have to

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,930
understand the customer to have empathy

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,750
to understand what the stakeholders want

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,090
what the result could be and even more

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,670
we should actually and I think most of

00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,920
us are already doing it bring more value

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,710
to the product or to what we're doing

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,110
that what is required from us right so I

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,350
think there's no real satisfaction to

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:51,140
just take a document and build the

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,120
product and just do exactly what's in

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,220
that document that's not really

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,230
fulfilling I mean any robot could do

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,590
that but when you come back with some

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,880
features when you come back with some

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,100
criticism or some remarks that make the

00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,980
product make the product better that

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:13,240
makes it very interesting so it seems to

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,240
me kind of interesting that

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,589
the job we're doing is not only very

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,579
technical it's something which is

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:25,850
extremely creative right we're mixing a

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:29,189
huge amount of combinations on

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,899
dimensions in what we're doing and we

00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:32,870
were having the discussion yesterday

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,889
about how you would start to learn

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,050
danyoung you wouldn't start to learn the

00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,730
basics and then you would expand and

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,490
then you would ascend the concepts and

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,899
then you would go to tools libraries and

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,790
then you finally enter the frameworks

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:49,079
but that is not the only only dimension

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,420
so this was a thought that that was very

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:55,079
interesting and I had a had a short

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,730
conversation with Yermo and I was saying

00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,480
to him and I think probably everybody

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,220
thinks that how how can you make it I

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,509
mean you're coding all the time but in

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,639
the same time we're running the business

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:10,259
and the same time is your tenth startup

00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:14,059
and and I just feel like I do nothing in

00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:16,230
my daily on a daily routine right and

00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,089
and I said yes you know you Americans

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,550
you do it like that it's very

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,519
interesting and he said to me yeah I

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:28,920
don't understand how you do it otherwise

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:31,290
and I was yeah it's interesting so it's

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,709
it's everything is in this context is a

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,870
matter of perspective so one of the one

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,959
of the things I think that JavaScript

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,059
brought to us is it opened perspectives

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,610
on the idea that we have access to

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,100
multiple dimensions in the code and the

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,639
projects that that we're doing so this

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:56,250
was this was a thought that I think is

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:57,870
essential for me and if you have things

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,879
to say or thoughts about it I would

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:05,459
really like to hear about them also

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:10,170
maybe you would like to start the meetup

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:13,160
on discuss about another topic that also

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:18,089
I think could be interesting for us

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:24,110
thinking is the pts do you know what it

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:24,110
is time to teacher

00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:32,940
so it's funny right because in the end

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,490
that the only things that matters

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,760
yeah code has it I mean code has to be

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,650
good

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,660
of course code has to be good like I

00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,370
assume that our code is about all are

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,230
they awesome we don't have to talk about

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,550
it

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,170
so in this perfect world where will a

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,030
perfect developers and our code is

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,650
perfect the only thing that really

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:55,440
matters is time to feature and it's it

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,750
was very interesting for me to see that

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,760
many developers when we sleep

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:05,560
requirements or talk to a customer the

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,450
customer says blah blee bloo bloo bla

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,500
bla and they say okay i'm going to react

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,550
and there's gonna be like that and

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,870
that's super architecture not

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,550
micro-service isn't going to put the

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,710
cloud and server less and then i'm going

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,890
to do the super super pattern and the

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,080
kind says hello did you even listen what

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,280
I had to say yeah it's okay I am fine

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,660
whatever

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,420
I'll do the code and it's going to be

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,980
awesome in fact there's a disconnect

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,890
from that perspective because the

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,930
customer or the person that were doing

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,300
the product for is essentially looking

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,780
for features he could not care less

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,190
about how are you doing it he's going to

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,560
care about it when your code is going to

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:49,090
crash and will not scale obviously but

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:53,590
that's later so this is also I would

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,540
like to advocate for for us to try to to

00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,450
switch our mindset from like how

00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,040
beautiful this architecture is to when

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:04,420
can and ship this code in good

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:09,880
conditions right and good enough in our

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:12,010
world is is perfect making the perfect

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,260
code we know that is is an abstract idea

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,750
in which we get lost because we want it

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:20,050
to make perfect but to make it perfect

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:24,370
the last 10% become like a neverending

00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:26,920
story so this is good enough notion

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,750
where you are making a mitigation

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,610
between the customers interest or the

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,580
client distress or product interest and

00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,340
what your coding is very interesting so

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,500
I was

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,670
listening to many of you in the

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:46,210
community and other guys and that is why

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,350
isn't JavaScript so popular yes you can

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,330
do everything with JavaScript is an

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,040
awesome language its freedom it's it

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:55,890
smells good it's perfect

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:59,830
keeps warm at night but most essentially

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:04,210
it seems to be that the it's product

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:07,060
life cycle is shorter that's the major

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:10,270
thing because our life is not eternal so

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,850
we would like to ship more features in a

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,320
smaller chunks of times so essentially

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:19,210
it is also something that javascript

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,740
beings in the mentality so yeah that's a

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,500
definite that's interesting for that I

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,040
wanted to also share with you and again

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,750
is if we you would like to discuss at

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,690
the post at any moment or if you want to

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,220
go to meet up or or think about that in

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,880
the group or in the community I really

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:41,130
would like to invite you to to talk

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,030
about it let's see I had some other

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,030
topics yeah

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:54,160
jQuery is still cool Alex said yeah the

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,430
jQuery is still cool the codebase is

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,600
awesome you have to look at it but

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:08,220
jQuery is not only cool for that reason

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:11,860
jQuery is also the superhero of TTF

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,260
never again before jquery front-end

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:18,850
developers were able to ship features at

00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:21,460
that speed and that is cool and even

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:26,830
today I really really love the Alex

00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,690
example your applications the work in

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:32,550
jQuery not work still in jQuery very

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,820
very well today I see very very often a

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,870
lot of time spent on making awesome

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,630
architectures with angular and with

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:44,320
react and I really love those frameworks

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,540
so don't don't get me wrong but on the

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,929
other hand sometimes they look like big

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,940
hammers to kill small ends right some

00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,970
maker is just the thing that you need

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,799
and we should some we should try to

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,330
resist to the temptation of always

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,309
trying the next frame or the next cool

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,980
thing because there's the ramped up

00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,779
there's the learning the excitement and

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,230
we lose focus from the goal which is

00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:10,480
shipping features so from that

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,129
perspective I can say and probably some

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,529
of you guys who have worked with jQuery

00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:17,259
I worked on huge code bases with jQuery

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,820
and if you want to write spaghetti code

00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,740
you can do it in react and angular tune

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:29,129
it's not an issue

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:31,990
so that's fine in this conference

00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:34,119
there's a topic that I'm at that time

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:38,049
I'm missing a couple of topics that I'm

00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:41,379
missing and I wish we would have we

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:45,519
would had them testing is not very

00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:47,679
pleasant it's a very interesting topic

00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,080
most of the companies that I know on

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,129
teams that I know are still working for

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,730
end-to-end testing with other frameworks

00:20:54,129 --> 00:21:03,190
that not a JavaScript based mainly Java

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:07,210
for the guys working with what's the

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:08,470
name of this one selling thank you so

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,289
yes there are things that connect the

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,740
selenium and and there are there there

00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:16,299
options but besides just and shy and

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,330
unit testing with some JavaScript

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:22,869
frameworks there I'm not aware of some

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,619
suit of tools that would be fully

00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:29,830
JavaScript and that would be unit and

00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:33,100
end-to-end tests so if you guys use such

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,869
things I would be really reinvested to

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,539
to have a discussion with you I think

00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:40,059
it's a it's one of the maturity points

00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:44,679
that we we need to look at in the in the

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:49,090
ecosystem and that at least I I miss I

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:51,639
miss a lot so I was very excited about

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,789
Cypress IO I don't know if you heard

00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:58,350
about it it's a integrated fully

00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:58,350
integrated test I think it runs with

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:05,080
my goodness I need more coffee the stuff

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,840
that runs in JavaScript on the browser

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,000
help me out the browser on the on the

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,130
desktop sorry electron yeah it runs an

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,960
electron and all the tests and the and

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,419
the browser engine is in one single

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,020
single app unfortunately it is not open

00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,529
source

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,570
thank you for pointing it but it's

00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:29,350
absolutely awesome it really changes the

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,690
way you look at look at testing so this

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:34,840
is a topic that I also would like to to

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,730
open in the community and and see who's

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,700
doing what and what works well for them

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,220
I had a very interesting talk with chip

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,440
really his the city of not logic here in

00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,480
the inclusion and he mentioned that he

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:52,510
was using typescript as base descriptors

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,279
including for the tests and he was able

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,679
to chain the tools of testing on what

00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,029
the description was in entire script so

00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,909
I think that was very interesting and

00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,559
was the first approach of this kind so

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:11,309
if you have something in that field

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:14,049
please let us know oh let me see yeah

00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:18,240
what is javo'''s were going that the

00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:24,330
everybody's had the 100 point question

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:27,130
it's really hard to tell but I had some

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,649
some discussions with a guy I don't know

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,230
he's here today his name is avi da porra

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:38,279
he worked for two years at at Facebook

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:41,830
in the JavaScript infrastructure oh and

00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:45,070
I was expecting him to be like the super

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:50,470
advocate of react and everything that

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:52,390
Facebook that that Facebook did and at

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,220
my greatest surprise he was saying you

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,190
know Facebook is a very pragmatic Oh

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:01,960
company and if they find something

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,899
better that is their needs they'll do it

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,440
and and he said and that was very

00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:10,169
interesting for me that

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,080
there was a little focus on polymer I

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:17,309
don't know if you guys started to use it

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,830
who who uses polymer so guys we're

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,570
waiting for you at the community and we

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,200
want to know what what you know and what

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,299
you think about it okay it's definitely

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,520
very cool it has a lot of a lot of

00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,740
interesting things so we have web of

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,789
assembly we have polymer which which is

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,910
very interesting

00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:37,230
so if you guys have interests for the

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,390
future of JavaScript and if you have

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,799
kids or even like you would like to

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,740
discuss about it

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,750
please make us a sign and let us know

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,370
it's it's a topic that it's extremely

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,659
important for us thinking a bit ahead of

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,210
time and trying to figure out what's

00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:58,320
going to be next I think is very

00:24:51,210 --> 00:25:02,130
important as well then there is one last

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,590
thing that I wished we would have in

00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:09,740
this conference and and hopefully we'll

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,740
have it in the next one is related to AI

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,659
I think nobody believes that they will

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,020
continue to do the same thing ever and

00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,850
ever

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,390
for the next year's in the development

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,210
world so I think we agree with that the

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,970
question is how much of what we're doing

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:32,400
today is going to be replaced by AI and

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:35,880
automation this is a I think it's a

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,659
fundamental topic because everything

00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,539
that we learn today

00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:42,179
might be completely obsolete not in five

00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:44,520
years but in one or two years the

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,230
process of developments that we that we

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,690
use might be completely changed and

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:55,440
influenced by that so I added a very

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,480
interesting things regarding of AI

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,419
analysis because I think there is a

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:06,600
project in the MIT that allows you to

00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:09,120
open whatever image you drag and drop a

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,789
selection you make a selection on this

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,179
UI and the eye automatically detects

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:17,460
what it is like even if you take like

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,720
200 and 200 pixels and it figures out if

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,080
it's bootstrap it takes

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,330
what the style is behind and it's blows

00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,980
directly for you although you I with

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:33,570
that style say says everything

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:35,679
integrated and that's today scary so

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,600
it's a topic that we're not thinking a

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,370
lot because we have to deliver features

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:45,549
on a daily basis but AI is going to

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:49,030
definitely come and have a huge impact

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:52,059
on interfaces and I'm not even speaking

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:54,690
about a multiplex UI where UI is not

00:26:52,059 --> 00:27:00,419
only by dimensional I was really

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:03,929
interested to see that Microsoft is

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:07,570
really advancing the hologram technology

00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,179
they even call now augmented reality

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,909
virtual reality and Holograms mixed

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:15,929
reality they've launched recently a

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:19,120
website which is fluent Microsoft comm

00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:22,299
which is a website about the concepts

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,419
that they have about a fluent or fluid

00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:29,230
UI which is mixed is not only related to

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:32,230
us doing a web component is about voice

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:35,530
it's about interaction with Holograms

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:38,500
it's three-dimensional stuff

00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:41,679
it is also reversed communication where

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,679
the machines are centering us right

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,740
they're looking at us and I say you look

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:51,220
a bit pale you should have some iron so

00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,830
all these events we're going to to kick

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,630
in actually they've kicked in in our

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:58,000
industry and they would have an impact

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,429
on the way we are doing front-end

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,530
obviously because a lot of user

00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,150
interface is there but back-end as well

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:08,679
because back-end will have to adapt to

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:10,960
these new particles so this is a couple

00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:16,150
of topics that I think we should discuss

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,159
in the community so please if you have

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,590
any desire to to share your thoughts

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,750
give us a sign

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:28,480
organizer made up and even better send

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,490
us a paper for next conference if you if

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,850
you wish to discuss about this this

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,850
