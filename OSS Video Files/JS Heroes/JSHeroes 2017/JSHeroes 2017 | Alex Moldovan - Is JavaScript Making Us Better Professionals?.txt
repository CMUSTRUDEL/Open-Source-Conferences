Publication date: 2017-06-23

Description: 
	We can all agree that JavaScript is a trending programming language. But is this a good thing? Is JavaScript the right language to learn or to study? Can we push the language into the academic field so that students are better prepared for the jobs of the future in IT? 
I want to make a case here, that JavaScript forces you to go one step further in understanding what you are doing, compared with other mainstream languages that have their abstractions already built into the language. We will look at a few common patterns to establish some context and we will discuss about the dangers of abstractions and the source of the JavaScript Fatigueâ„¢.
