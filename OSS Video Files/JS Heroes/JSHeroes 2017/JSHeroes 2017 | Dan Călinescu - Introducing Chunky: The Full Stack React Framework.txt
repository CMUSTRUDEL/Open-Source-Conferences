good morning everyone

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,390
I slept an average of maybe 10 hours in

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,640
the past five days so there's obviously

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,439
a lot of horrible things I will say but

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,950
it doesn't matter where amongst friends

00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:33,860
lots of friends so yesterday I saw

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:38,150
presentation I forgot who he was the

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,130
history of JavaScript 1995 2005 2015 who

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,609
was it

00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:47,600
Benedict maybe oh you okay great so I

00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:52,510
just realized how old I am I'm I'm

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:59,590
almost 40 I actually turned 38 yesterday

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,590
so thank you and I was thinking what oh

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,089
so that that's all it takes to get some

00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,650
claps you know just like make sure you

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:08,840
time your birthday's at the next

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,240
conference so I was wondering you know I

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,040
was talking to Alice yesterday about

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,450
blockchain so one of the reasons why I

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,860
will definitely mess up this

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,710
presentation because I've been thinking

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,180
about blotching for the past few hours

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,460
and I was like also you mean it's kinda

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,759
like peer-to-peer kind of like Napster

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:32,030
right and it's like Napster I was five

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:34,549
but I remember the day one like Napster

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,250
came on like this new cool thing new

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,740
cool thing you know and I realized how

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,040
old I am and I realize how fast things

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:46,070
move you know and react is so cool for

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,490
now until gear more invent something

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,149
else and then it's over so I thought

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,880
maybe I'll start with what happened

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,640
before 1995 because we talked about

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,289
1995's and that was like a pre-internet

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,750
era so I'm like you're not there's

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:04,969
actually another year before 1995 that

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,560
was very important for me and that was

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,250
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,170
now if you don't know the 994 Jersey

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,040
that means you're really young so I'm

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,990
going to give you a little history

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,340
lesson that was the greatest soccer team

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,140
this country has ever seen

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,630
right so if you don't agree I don't care

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,340
I'm that's true

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,810
now they don't call them the golden team

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,569
and the goal there because they all

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,640
painted their hair yellow I did too but

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,810
it's just because they're the best ever

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,500
and you know for me these guys are my

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,850
heroes

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,380
they're my soccer heroes you know and I

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,920
think there's a lot of parallels between

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,160
sports and JavaScript and you know

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,510
programming so if this is a JavaScript

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,489
heroes conference I thought I'll start

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,810
talking about some other kind of heroes

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,940
and see if we can draw parallels so

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,610
these are these were my soccer heroes in

00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:03,510
1994 I know it's going to sound crazy

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:04,860
balls I was 15 and and I just want to be

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,780
a soccer player I could care less about

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,489
programming and I was into other things

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,140
other than programming you know like a

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,530
lot of my friends here you know

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,000
philosophy and art and stuff and I think

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:20,459
I think that programming has to get back

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,100
to that and I'm going to explain so

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,079
these are my heroes but not just

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,600
this guy the middle guy Leah Dumitrescu

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,000
and then I I think I think I figure out

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,650
why gear moves here why he chose clues

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,239
to just come and like be here because

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,769
it's a big it's a big honor and I think

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,870
I figured it out that same year it's the

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,030
year that we had our biggest victory

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,340
other than obviously style winning 86

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,410
but that's even before the night we

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,810
actually beat Argentina 3-2 and Ilya

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,810
Demeter's to score two goals in the

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,390
first 18 minutes now we're going to

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,680
score two goals in the next five years

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:00,870
but so I think game was here to kind of

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,310
like I don't know I have no idea why but

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,700
I think it's related to that so we got

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,880
to connect the dots somehow so these are

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,320
my heroes but I know so talk about 90

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,299
force about these two - actually he

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,459
scored the first goal for Argentina they

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,459
lost obviously and he actually took a

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,970
dive so that's him diving but you know

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,760
in 94 another guy became famous another

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,250
soccer hero Babette Oh at the bottom

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,620
here this is him and that's romário not

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,010
one of my heroes and what he's doing

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,730
there

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,700
he's cradling the baby he just had a

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,680
baby well not him but his wife and he

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,600
was at the World Cup and he said if he

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,330
scores the goal he's gonna tell the

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,920
whole world he had a baby okay so he

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,380
scored a goal so he just spontaneously

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,440
invented this like cradling the baby you

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,630
know and he also meant that I'm so good

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,600
at soccer because I'm a soccer hero and

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,130
it's so easy a baby can score okay so

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
then everyone jumped in so now he's

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,390
famous for inventing the creating the

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
baby so that was romário back then

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,500
they're all creating the baby one

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,290
discordant in 2014 that's him again and

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,510
to the right that's his son the son that

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,220
he had in 94 and he's a professional

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:16,910
soccer player he signed it I think loose

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,980
balls or some in Portugal I think and

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:24,180
it's funny he became famous because

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:27,660
because he was good for time for four

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,210
top four goal scorer of Brazil some kind

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,960
of hero but he was also here because he

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,760
he paid respect to an yarder he honored

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,590
his son so to me that's very important

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,350
cuz I have four kids so I'll bring this

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,290
so this is another hero of mine Totti he

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:47,610
just retired a week ago or two weeks ago

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:50,490
as the most loyal hero in in Italian

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,240
soccer ever he was drafted at a seroma

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:57,060
on your 13 he was insanely good if you

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,000
know what I'm talking about and he got

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,190
an offer at Real Madrid well he didn't

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,940
go he stayed and he just retired and

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,860
when he he'd not him his wife gave birth

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,290
to one of their children he invented

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,210
this sucking the thumb trend just like

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,140
Babette oh so now everyone sucks their

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,120
tongue even Messi suck system and and

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,450
they do it because they say you know

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,010
it's so easy any a baby could do this

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,260
you know I'm so good a baby could do

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,060
this that's the whole thing so this is

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,470
transition from life you know honoring

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,789
their kids like you know what daddies

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,319
can like do this because it's because

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,210
it's easy someone so so this

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,270
this is me giving you that talk today

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,770
and I don't know what he's pointing at

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,749
because it's weird they don't suck your

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,110
thumb and pointing some guy but he does

00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:48,899
not impress now is he done for me he's

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,569
like the old-time hero because because

00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:54,300
period and that's why I used to wear

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,039
number 5 so so he done just won two

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,569
Champions League so he's the superhero

00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,879
right now he won everything now he

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:05,189
wanted as a coach so what I'm getting at

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:08,159
is that what I would like is for a

00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,889
generation of all heroes like me and

00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:13,319
Paul maybe we're old like I mean that's

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,539
life to figure out ways like this

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,330
conference like tools like frameworks

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,699
like whatever the hell anything to turn

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,319
a new generation of young people into

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,789
heroes and I love the name of this

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,830
conference heroes and why I'm finishing

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,749
this letter I'm not finishing but what I

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,159
stopped at the slide because I don't

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:34,259
know if you recognize what what this is

00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:37,499
do you recognize anyone or anything in

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,349
there anyone in the middle right

00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,939
but you know what this is we they're

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,180
kind of they're kind of like anonymous

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,409
right not as an anonymous anonymous but

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,569
as they're like we don't know them well

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,519
they're done either the best team in

00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,759
Romania v total they just won the

00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:55,110
Romanian 2017 Cup they beat chef Eric

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,610
loose but like no one needs to know that

00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:02,759
and and has worked for eight years

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,860
eight years at this club he got young

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,119
kids very young kids because they're

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,249
still young but they were younger eight

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:10,529
years ago he worked to them he trained

00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:12,059
them and they freaking beat style and

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm still crying about it because I must

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,509
at least because Osborne because but I

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,349
no need to know about that either but a

00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,199
point is he won the championship and why

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:26,219
because he figured out a way like a tool

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,469
of framework a structure a club to breed

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,269
a new culture of Heroes and I think this

00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,889
is what I I to me this is what this

00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,199
conference about and this is what we

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,969
should do you become a hero figure

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:39,120
things out to make other people's heroes

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,889
you know so I really like this but so

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,260
one of the heroes I want to present

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:46,529
today's Andhra Marine hello Andhra I

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,889

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:08,960
known as poofy so poofy basically just

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,940
became a hero because this is televised

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,570
right so it's going to be on pro TV and

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,880
basically Andra is my she's a hero in

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,350
mime in my mind because Monday well

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,570
actually not Monday because we're all

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,510
children so June first we don't work but

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,130
Tuesday we had nothing and two days ago

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,740
we have an app on the app store

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,690
so to me this is this is the new breed

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,050
of heroes this is the veto to this is

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,840
the new soccer players that I think can

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,540
can rise at least in this country so if

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,770
Ana if Andra can't do this app I think

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,600
other people that doesn't mean that

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,690
unlike just if and I can do it anyone

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,300
can do it no but but what I mean is that

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:51,950
you know this is her first app on the

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:55,070
App Store and she did it and my point is

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,110
that if we invest more time in building

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,300
tools and platforms and paradigms and

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,560
whatever the hell we need to do to make

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:08,180
more andrás into heroes right Andra

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,980
she's dying sorry okay ELISA I don't

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,850
know why our mobile teams all girls but

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,350
that's another story

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:17,240
okay and and then basically my whole

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,850
point is and this is this is going to be

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,320
fun I realize that if for no other

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,300
reason this is what I'm going to do

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,600
right now this is the meat of my talk so

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,610
you ready for this so Maria okay she's

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,700
18 she's the smartest the smartest

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,290
person in the room for sure don't feel

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,630
offended she's just smarter than all of

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,640
us and she just she just got accepted at

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,290
Oxford and I'm not a thousand

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,630
universities alright but I think she

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,660
likes off Oxford and this is what I said

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,550
I'm going to said this I'm gonna tell

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,070
them the whole room and everyone else at

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,420
home now you're going to go to Oxford

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,100
you go to study but then you're going to

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,600
come back to Romania right and you're

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,520
going to say yes like right like you're

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,900
gonna come back right yes please so

00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
that's you have to come back now so

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,070
there's no other reason for me to talk

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,630
today it's just it this is it

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,870
I she's going to come back to remain so

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,820
the point is I really think that if we

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,310
get all these smart brains in this room

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,620
especially the younger ones to stay here

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,870
and build amazing things we can be like

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,370
not just the best soccer team in the

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,959
world but we can be the best developers

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,959
in the world so that's the premise of

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,230
everything that I want to do so now the

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,860
problem is right now as Vladimir showed

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,940
and others before building apps is like

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,769
this and it's like hey bro or girl get

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,930
in there and land that plane you know

00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,610
just click the button look there's like

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,540
good seats there those are Redux

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,800
reducers they're shiny you know and and

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,600
then you're just gonna slide the

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,130
freaking plane in like some sort of

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,519
Dubai building there I think that's the

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,319
bite but but it's there just look and

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,180
and if it doesn't work out you can also

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,589
have the bar with you and just get drunk

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,100
while you do it so then it's like always

00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,050
drunk you know so I think this so in 94

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,009
when I didn't want to be developer up to

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,889
like 2015 okay I pretty much didn't

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,329
mobile that's all I did mostly except I

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,880
played with some JavaScript back in the

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:13,670
day but like it's funny with mootools

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,459
developed by Guillermo so two years ago

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,010
I decided to like reinvent myself so I'm

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,839
like let me pick JavaScript so I'm on a

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,510
new diet JavaScript I've been doing it

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,910
for two years and it's a mess to me at

00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,410
least and it feels like this cockpit you

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,569
know what I've been doing objective-c

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,519
for nine years I'm like that's nothing

00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:34,339
compared to JavaScript but they have

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,440
reducers you know and and then I

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,709
realized how the hell am I going to turn

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,269
Ondra into a into a hero and how we're

00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,730
going to create a department where we

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:46,490
create amazing apps for amazing startups

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,930
with this freaking like mess now I know

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,860
you you're affectionately calling

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,889
fatigue I call it like a suicide killer

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:59,449
something evil eyes bleeding eye

00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:01,339
whatever you okay so I know I know no

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm saying if there's a huge elephant in

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:06,529
the room Redux is fine at 99 lines if

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,350
you take all the comments is 65 it's so

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:12,050
simple and then your code is 3000 line

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,500
setting up Redux you know the reduces

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,510
and all that stuff what happened

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,180
am I am I am I out of time all right so

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,720
the point is I wanted to figure a way

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:28,180
out to get Aundre to be a hero and not

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,170
put her in this freaking cockpit so then

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,070
I came up with this

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:35,050
I call it chunky this is most of my

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,520
open-source projects come from nicknames

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,230
I give my kids and my two-year-old

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,000
daughter she's like cute and fat and

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,940
chubby and I call her my chunky monkey

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,370
so I'm like I'll call it chunky and then

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,260
I took this funky reacting here and if

00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,930
I'm gonna probably spend two hours just

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,020
talking about the logo but you've

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:56,470
probably seen that it blinks right okay

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,600
so it's just this this kind of

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,810
full-stack react framework like Vladimir

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,640
saying it's not fully full-stack yet but

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,800
hopefully one day Vladimir contributes

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,230
to it or someone else and it's for mere

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,920
mortals I mean me moral in the sense

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,560
that we don't all have to be easy done

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,570
we don't all have to be Babette oh and

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,830
you know other players I probably have

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,420
no idea what I'm naming right now

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,810
Babette was really old but like whoever

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,110
you we don't have to be rock stars I

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,940
hate when they call a HR called

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:31,570
developers ninjas I completely hate it

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,460
and you know I looked up superheroes at

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,520
some point and it turns out like the

00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,260
most beloved superhero is Batman and I

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,880
looked into it I needed to understand

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,910
why Batman is so beloved you know why

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,820
he's the only superhero that's fully

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:48,130
human do you know that he doesn't fly

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,850
doesn't do crap like all the other

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,440
superheroes

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,860
obviously your superhero if you can't

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,470
fly big deal I can like you know even

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,020
even like Iron Man he had a fake heart

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,450
thing he's not human anymore Batman is

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,990
so I really think what we need is a new

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:07,570
breed of heroes just freaking GS heroes

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,370
pure heroes not superheroes if you have

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:13,120
called this conference J supers I would

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:15,490
have never even slept in this so so I

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,430
call this heroes mere mortals we're all

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,070
mortals or all normal people so why the

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,980
hell do we build frameworks that look

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,020
like this you know why do I have so many

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,030
buttons and so I wanted to create

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,600
something that I could explain

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:33,610
to my kids and I explained to you know

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,610
whoever wants to understand our insane

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,970
world and maybe that will mean that some

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,310
sort of artist philosopher writer person

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:46,180
who's not technical might be attracted

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,950
to our technology crazy world and build

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,050
the next amazing thing because you know

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,090
the great products we all use were not

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,760
built by technologists probably by

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,440
artists and philosophers so I think one

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,480
of the things I want to do and I would

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,300
invite us all to do is to to use our

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,790
superpowers okay that doesn't work with

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,300
like superheroes normal powers of

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,670
developers or and build simple tools

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,410
that are just simple in lines but simple

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,610
to understand and simple to apply but

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,660
that means that they're not going to be

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,100
used they're not going to be they're not

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,310
going to solve all the problems all the

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,130
time so so why should you care so first

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,190
of all who should care about chunky

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,890
think the people who don't consider

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,980
themselves rockstars and it mean just

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,470
should worry about about about chunky I

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,690
don't know if you heard of Seinfeld but

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,950
I think I think Seinfeld is the best

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,930
example of of how you you should prepare

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,450
for a talk just like talk about nothing

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,000
they build up they build a fortune on

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,040
nothing anyways so this is this a joke

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,140
in Seinfeld no soup for you if you know

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,840
what I'm talking about so if you're

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,280
ninja in a rock star then chunk is no

00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,710
soup for you chunky is not gonna give

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,330
you any soup by the way chunky also

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,250
comes from the idea that you know

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,620
instead of eating disgusting spaghetti

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:08,380
code you should eat you know healthy

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,390
chunky soup so there's no chunky soup

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,280
for you if you think you're a ninja and

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,290
you're a rockstar it's not for you so it

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,030
is for the people who are humble enough

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,800
to think that it to know that like

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,810
Vladimir I love tough Agassi I don't

00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,790
freaking know what pH they w-whatever

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,120
are I love that you know we shouldn't

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:28,270
act smart when we're not smart so this

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,510
is built for views this is built for

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,060
this is built for mere mortals who are

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,560
smart we're all smart everyone has their

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,470
own level of brains

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,120
but when we admit that we don't know

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,800
everything and we're not going to know

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,000
everything this is what chunky

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:48,910
for so and that's because mere mortals

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,920
are human too so why why why should you

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:55,360
care right so who but why should you

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,520
care I think because reality because

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,800
because honestly a lot of the times when

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,720
we build frameworks and tools I don't

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,300
think we keep I love what you said about

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,130
reality or what yeah yeah you your know

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,560
whether you're the speaker before see

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,840
I'm like I'm gonna say stupid things but

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,640
basically when you go and you I don't

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,140
know I think years before the cloud when

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,820
you're like okay so you build this the

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,550
tutorial tells you this but in real life

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,810
your app just dies okay so in the real

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,190
world what happens you have an

00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,920
entrepreneur who's probably not

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,570
technical okay and they have this idea

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,950
that they don't know if it works or not

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,660
so people are trying to solve that

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,730
problem with Lean Startup or design

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,070
thinking or whatever and on this other

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,160
side we have us who we have reducers and

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,780
actions and you know selectors and react

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,970
and webinar and he doesn't give a

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,880
he just wants an app he wants to build

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,670
an app he wants it real he wants it fast

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,770
and he some kid in Nebraska can do it in

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,600
pH before he's gonna hire that kid you

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,310
know so then it's us here doing

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,810
JavaScript or cool

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,220
and we're just not gonna get the

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,200
business and you're gonna end up being a

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,650
taxi or an uber driver because you know

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:04,510
that's cool so this is why you should

00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:06,910
care because it's better it's better to

00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,400
build an app that doesn't have all the

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,840
shiny amazing cool things but does what

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,970
the entrepreneur in the businessperson

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,520
is so I'm hoping that chunky can be a

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,750
tool that can you know and all the

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,210
strife and the wars between

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:22,180
entrepreneurs between the CEO and the

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,620
CEO right if it does that that that that

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,920
that will be great

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,620
and also because nerds have lives too or

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,480
we should have life you know we're not

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,780
all about like someone came up with this

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,830
amazing formula I sorry Ben you know I

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:41,200
think that ties to the second a Newton's

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,610
second law you know force equals MA with

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,080
where you you know if you want to get

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,060
better you should learn more and we have

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,280
all these like learning and yeah I'm

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,770
teaching too because yeah I got on the

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,750
bandwagon you know but we have lies we

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,670
can just keep learning everything you

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,450
know and I have four kids guys I can

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,190
learn everything

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,080
okay I only have one hand I've been

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:06,810
programming with one hand for ten years

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:10,240
okay yes I'm a one-handed programmer so

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:13,030
so so this is mostly white chunky

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,780
because because reality and because

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:20,050
because we're human we're human so the

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,270
three features are chunky chunky has

00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:25,540
opinions like any two-year-old you know

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:27,370
and in the in a sense that you might

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,960
want react router and I love react

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,970
router and I'm working on a framework

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,190
for react router for the web but I

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,950
choose react navigation for mobile

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,450
because I just have opinions and you

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,910
know what it might not be the best thing

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,310
but if every single person and every

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,590
single project does the same freaking

00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,090
research we're not going to get anywhere

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,580
and that up it's going to be built by

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,800
the kid from Nebraska in pH before right

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,080
so what I wanted to do is just pick a

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,110
stack I don't care if it's not the best

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,490
AK just pick a stack make some smart

00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,170
decisions on some of the netiquette

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,240
why'd you pick navigation because well

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,230
okay not to go up walk because I had no

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,080
idea okay

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,550
so just pick a stack go with it and then

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,620
everyone's going to use the stack and

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,740
I'll just do my best to make sure you

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,840
can swipe just like cut out react

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,100
navigation for something I'm definitely

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,560
gonna make sure you can cut out with

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,900
ducks because I'm just loving and hating

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,120
and loving and hating and I'm mostly

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,610
hating it right about now but so you can

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,350
you can take out some things and put in

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,670
some other things but the paradigm

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,650
should stay the same and you shouldn't

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,200
do all the research first why would you

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,220
research what's the best way to do bla

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,690
bla bla bla bla

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,580
why should you do that you know let

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,160
someone else do the research like in the

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,560
real world and then you just implement

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,870
are we all gonna be machine learning

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,300
scientists guy come on we're not all

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,680
going to be scientists you know Google

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,600
hired the best scientists in the world

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,580
she's gonna have the best team oh she

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,140
already does and she's gonna come up

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,300
with the best algorithms I'm we're gonna

00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,520
use the algorithms you know we don't

00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,410
know how they're I bet you we don't know

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,200
how CPUs work I bet you we don't know

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,120
and it doesn't matter right so so I

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,590
think it's good to have opinion that

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,230
this is what chunky does ages has

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,800
opinions and you can definitely

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,600
contribute

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,490
and can change those opinions if you

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,750
don't like those opinions but if we come

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,610
up with our own penis just use them and

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,940
the second thing that I like on color

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,480
Tuesday I live on Tuesday you know what

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,250
truth is and and and and what I love

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,830
about color tool is that there's no more

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,750
wires they hit the wires it's pretty

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,220
it's beautiful and I want you know I was

00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,260
wondering like why do they only use

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,910
color too easy to hide the wires because

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,950
that's where people come into clues you

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,240
know so we got a while the the tourists

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,830
but by the time they get to cheap eyes

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,240
they don't care anymore like clues

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,890
doesn't have wires but they figure out

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,840
that you know cuz they didn't anyway so

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,640
it's a marketing thing but hiding the

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,490
wires is a good thing in programming I

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,190
don't wonder how I really really don't

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,260
wanna wire actions and selectors anymore

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,420
you know like your code that's a good

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,920
that's I mean that's what we wrote some

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,610
of our first apps I just don't want to

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,100
do that anymore

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,200
why should you cut and paste from web

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,990
and mobile you know why should you do it

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,750
why should I even care what the hell a

00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,000
reducer does and an action that one I

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,860
act it's funny cuz I can't wait to see

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,980
his action Italy I selected like one

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:20,680
line yet you know it's why okay so I I

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,420
just wanted to hide the wires I wanted

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,000
to hide the wiring I just want to click

00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,430
a few things it's not gonna work 90% of

00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,280
the time it works or just sorry it's not

00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,170
gonna work 10% of the time that's what I

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,790
really meant you know and I will figure

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,160
out a way to make it work in the other

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,930
time and they are the last thing the

00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,430
last thing I really think you should

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,110
make you smile a framework should make

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:47,470
you smile you should use the framing

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:52,300
should be like comma no yes or it's life

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:54,430
made by poofy wait I can so by the way

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,250
you should download it it's a real thing

00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,870
you know so it's a real app so when you

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,610
when you when you when I see a

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,830
developers face and say well I don't

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,120
know react and I don't know Redux and I

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,790
don't know this but I want to learn

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,390
don't worry just use chunky do your

00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,640
thing

00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,400
you know JSON you're good to go and then

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,200
just write a bit of UI click a few

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,990
buttons and command lines and your abs

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,120
on yes that's it that's it go have fun

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:21,670
you know street food festival whatever

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,880
so that should make you smile you know

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,370
what

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,560
what you're eating burgers my absalon's

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:30,100
yes or what well I'm still wearing my

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,200
Redux you know so I'm hoping that if you

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,380
stunk you're gonna laugh more I really

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,290
hope so that's that's it all right so

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,670
how what does it take what does it take

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,310
to start it's a one-liner

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,520
I love that one command to rule them all

00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:49,570
but I have a comment rule sample is

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,580
called chunky and and you just install

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,770
chunky and you'd be surprised how many

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,920
times I reinstall react native because I

00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,320
just kept reinstalling react native CLI

00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,960
by accident but it's react chunky CLI

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,760
guys so install react chunky and then if

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,410
you do I promise your life will never be

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,790
the same for you and your loved ones

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,890
that should be the slogan for chunky

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,900
forever turns into a startup and then

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,240
depending on your depending on your why

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,880
are your your connection it could take a

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,160
minute or two to download all the magic

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,860
put it on your file system unzip it

00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,540
because it's just a template you don't

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,130
have a magicians and they do this tricks

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,690
that they do it choose like a inflict oh

00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:30,240
that's it so I'm not going to tell you

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,620
how I'm doing this it's just two minutes

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,810
it's not like I take that thing off

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,690
github and unzip it and it's a template

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:40,720
and just do something anyways so it

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,190
works so you get it has templates okay

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,660
so there's a template right now for the

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,020
J's heroes app so if you want to create

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:50,050
a new york javascript errs happen and

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,720
you know or whatever you download the

00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,760
conference it automatically downloads it

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,680
for you you download you you install the

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,600
template and then you get started and

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,510
then you have this idea of course of

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,630
chunks and but at that separate so and

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,210
then i just override that the packager

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,890
because some genius at face book said no

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,100
we're not going to use webpack because

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:14,020
one of three milliseconds - whatever so

00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,580
they invented their own packard i've

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,100
drives me crazy so i hooked into it a

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,450
little bit but a point is i override a

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,480
bunch of that stuff so all you have to

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,040
do is just say chunky start chunky iOS

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,640
and maybe I should like chunky bye-bye

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:30,760
or something just for fun okay so that's

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:36,070
it I don't want to do a live demo how

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:39,980
much time do I have left okay so

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,450
okay so I I'm just gonna tell you it's

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,090
real it's a real thing

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,160
so this is though it works I'm also

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,020
using hyper but I did not get paid the

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,120
crew said it got paid for using hyper I

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,320
did not get paper either hyper anyway

00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:59,240
but I have the fancy thing anyways so

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,370
basically so if you if you get to this

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,500
point and you get to do this and press

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,650
ENTER and see this your life will never

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,300
be the same it's also building a

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:16,010
framework I built for CL eyes called

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:19,670
Solana and if you remain in you get you

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,830
get it you get it good yeah it's called

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,160
Solana and you just write what happened

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,590
not a conference talk and basically you

00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,450
know what's called Solana see foreigners

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,020
will not get its Lana means like a piece

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,790
of pork fat that okay that everyone

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,600
pretends they don't eat but everyone

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:42,650
does okay and it's called Lana because

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,080
Lana patents your node module with

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,220
delicious CLI abilities that was Lana

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,260
does but I don't know I'm talking about

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,060
Solana and if Lana's used to build this

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,890
so you have all these commands so you

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,390
can actually talk you know chunk start

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,340
which I have here so it starts your

00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,470
packager and what's different about this

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,810
is that instead of looking for the index

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,230
iOS and index Android where it typically

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:05,000
uses we're looks I kind of changed it

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:07,640
and I did a poll request a react native

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,440
for one freaking line guys and it took

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,360
like over 60 days and they still haven't

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,740
approved it that's another anyways so I

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,870
just hacked their whole package and I'm

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,420
using my pack sir but the point is so

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:21,860
now it also looks under my iOS under

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:26,170
under under my chunky and if you look at

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:31,310
a typical chunky app there is no iOS

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:33,350
index crap and so this is the file so

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,140
all you have there's no where's the

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,360
ended sideways there's no index is that

00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:40,640
why would you have an index iOS and like

00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,890
any I think an industry Buena so you

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,810
know what like what the hell just remove

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,510
the whole index so I just created this

00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,860
chunky JSON and I was really really

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,570
really one

00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,700
I really wanted to use the app JSON

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,990
which I it's so dumb two lines but I

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,010
think they're going to like take it out

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,840
at some point they're going to override

00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,130
something but I just said I'm not going

00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,690
to override a package I'm not going to

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,840
idea I'll just come and put a new JSON

00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:05,770
and this is your app so basically have a

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,000
bunch of chunks and sections so you can

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,650
connect your you can organize your

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,400
chunks in sections so here I have two

00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:15,080
sections one called sparked so a piece

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,510
of the app a section of the app it's

00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,370
called start and that's a section that

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,720
will deal with authentication in my in

00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,809
my case but I could have another big

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,110
section maybe that handles notifications

00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:29,330
and maybe you know in-app stuff that

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,620
marketing may want to send and then I

00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,320
have this huge section which is the

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,960
dashboard and then under there you have

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,090
layouts so for example I have jar layout

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,320
and this is this is why I use react

00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,400
navigation because they have that built

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,750
in but I'm not going to change it to

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,850
drawer because I have a bug and I

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,230
haven't tested it but I'm honest and I'm

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,490
telling you doesn't work but it won't

00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,549
worry by the time you get back home and

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,020
you use it so so but you just type tabs

00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,970
or you type drawer and then the tabs

00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,000
just transform into jars when it works

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:58,669
and ok and it's going to be really fun

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,320
so basically here I have stack and half

00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:02,510
three different chunks so I have a

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,000
conference chunk I have a schedule chunk

00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:08,179
and have a speaker's chunk okay and I

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,130
also have global transitions and I I did

00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:11,870
not want to invent something else to

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,390
describe transition so I just used the

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,309
typical URI schema or you have a source

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,169
now you have replaced but replace

00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,790
doesn't work in react navigation and the

00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:21,110
ecosystems going crazy because they

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,390
don't know how to figure that out

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:27,080
anyways so it's a fake replace is really

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:30,380
a push but it has you know but it has it

00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,850
tells you that you can replace and go to

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,860
the dashboard and let's call this

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,419
transition show dashboard and what that

00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,100
means is that I can go to this star

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,540
transitions that show dashboard and it

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,160
just goes there for me and as a

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,080
developer I don't need to figure out the

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,820
whole thing I don't need to understand

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,640
why the hell it happens just it just

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,860
happens just trust that it happens so

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,200
you just do this transition shows

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,179
dashboard transitions show login that's

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,860
all you got to do okay that's all you

00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,450
got to do is just over I just override a

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,950
bit of a screen stuff and do a lot of

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,830
magic in there you can take a look it's

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,309
nothing crazy but the point is why why

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,870
are we

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,789
not doing this why do we have to do a

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,710
whole thing over again all I want and

00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,710
even this can be obviously put in a JSON

00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,879
which will happen the next step is to

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,639
build a sketch plugin which I've already

00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:19,129
looked into it but is next and then you

00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:20,870
can generate you UI and that's it and we

00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:23,330
don't need developers anymore robots

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:26,450
will do it anyway but who's gonna who's

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:29,749
gonna call to the robot a anyways that's

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:32,179
so such if there's one thing you want to

00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:34,070
take away from this is that someone will

00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,019
tell you one day that you will be

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,850
replaced by robots as developers and

00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,350
what you should say is this who the

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:41,749
hell's gonna call the robots

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,669
well the robots are called what up okay

00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:47,090
who's going to code the robot that codes

00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:48,619
the robots that's going to be us so

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,379
we're going to be robot coder

00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:54,830
anyways so our jobs are safe trust me

00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:56,619
okay so then you have chunks so here you

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,869
have all these chunks so here's how much

00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:02,960
like okay - wait a minute so you have

00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:04,850
all you have is only all you have in

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,850
your app you have a chunky JSON that

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,700
explained that explains yeah that that

00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,259
explains it like to a two-year-old what

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,509
this app needs to do it has a bunch of

00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:18,200
sections it has a theme I can even

00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:20,360
change the theme here basic colors that

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,970
I want to change it has an ID that gets

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,429
all plugged into your Android manifest

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,820
and all the other insane obscure ways I

00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:31,580
hate Android as well but chunky fixes

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,279
that for you and then provisioning you

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,749
know initial firebase and stuff like

00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,610
that it supports firebase authentication

00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:40,129
with the firebase anyways but it's easy

00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,659
to support cuz firebase is in this okay

00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:43,639
and then all you have to do so you have

00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,509
the chunky JSON and any of chunks that's

00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:49,669
all you do just chunks and under chunks

00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:53,899
a lot of convention every folder name

00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,700
has to you know correspond to your names

00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:57,409
here but that's why there's templates

00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,330
just get a template don't mess I mean to

00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00,889
mess with it but you don't have to wire

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,220
it up and there so if you look at a

00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:05,600
different example yeah I'm drunk for

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,190
example if you look at the odd chunk

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:12,860
there's no screens there's nothing

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:14,850
because it extends another chunk so you

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,270
just can create chunks

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,950
I'm on NPM and then just reuse them so

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,960
the whole thing here in in

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,870
authentication the screen the registered

00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,240
the login the loading the transitions

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,280
the firebase communication the logout

00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,780
all that is an authentication chunk and

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,580
you can customize it you can do whatever

00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:37,440
the hell you want with it so for example

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:39,710
I can log out maybe okay so for example

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,450
I created this thing in style is called

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,830
dark you can have a dark or light theme

00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:47,940
so I don't want dark right now for

00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:51,270
example and there you go it just works

00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,010
right and then I can also hook in or not

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,130
other things like providers like

00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:59,190
firebase or a remote API or things like

00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:01,230
that so you can replay you can reuse the

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,600
chunks you can expand the chunks you can

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,670
customize the chunks so the bottom line

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,400
is you don't really need to be a react

00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:11,330
developer anymore it's over we killed it

00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,130
your you can be a chunk developer now

00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:16,980
you don't need to write entire apps you

00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,790
can write chunks of the apps why the

00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,350
hell not

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,590
why should you write the entire app

00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:24,390
write a chunk let that chunk to just one

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,820
specific thing that song does

00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:29,460
conferences that chunk does insane

00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,590
whatever images reuse the chunks so

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:36,210
that's pretty much what I have except

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:38,190
that yeah just go and contribute please

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,640
because I'm just getting tired of coding

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,800
this whole thing by myself that's it

00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,300
