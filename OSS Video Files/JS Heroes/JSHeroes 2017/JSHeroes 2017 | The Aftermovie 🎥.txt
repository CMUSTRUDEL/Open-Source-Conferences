00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,210
when I left there were no meter booth

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,220
yet no community to talk about and right

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,619
now it's driving a lot of brilliant to

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,779
sziasztok people and they organized this

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,910
a huge conference and I went to other

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,710
conferences and I actually can

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,900
appreciate how much work they put in it

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,900
everything they did just had

00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,500
[Applause]

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,270
Romania into the night to the meetup

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,580
eliminating community with a maxim

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,220
Houston people keep keep doing what you

00:00:50,580 --> 00:01:01,530
say

00:00:51,220 --> 00:01:04,629
[Music]

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,860
I'm Andre I'm here from Bucharest

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,570
we're actually representing the

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,150
JavaScript community from Bucharest and

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,650
we're actually glad to be here super

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,780
excited that you know this event can

00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,620
happen in Romania is

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,810
[Music]

00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,420
it's been a year since I've come back

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,490
and I think I think such a dramatic

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,740
change and partly a lot of credit if

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,630
through the to JavaScript of communities

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,850
I ensure people for the create

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,770
experience everything from the

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,080
conference organization as well as to

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,570
the attendees the engagement the passion

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,580
here about JavaScript it was great I

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,980
think I'm going back so much more

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,000
energized and giving back go to the

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,400
community stay strong and stay curious

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,030
[Applause]

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,370
[Music]

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,170
I honestly have to say this is the best

00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,140
conference I've seen in Romania and even

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,690
abroad and it's still the most people

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,850
oriented conference I've seen Enochian

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,880
it starts with a here I'm all about this

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,290
creating a story and storytelling and

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,899
putting the here or the center of the

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,310
story and the idea that it's all about

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,650
JavaScript heroes I love it I really

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,540
think that this is exactly for the local

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,150
teams and to just put people at the

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,250
center of a comprehensive the technology

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,140
and I really think it's going to be a

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,520
destroy it is a disruptive conference

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,560
but I'm looking for in the next few

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
years I think it's going to be even more

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,400
amazing than now

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,019
the topics were very friendly you could

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,110
definitely get a glimpse of what's going

00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:40,650
on and you definitely had something

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,110
sweet the grace of the more advanced

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,199
people some enzyme philosophical

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,199
[Music]

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,850
actually one of my priorities is to go

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,260
to as many places Basel really often so

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,900
it's here different perspectives

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,310
every time I go to a new place people

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,730
have a slightly different set of

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,840
experiences and I would even say that

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,910
it's helped a lot with deciding what

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,070
technology should focus on what problems

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,480
are solved a lot of that comes from

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,820
little conversations that you have at a

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,310
conference and things like that so I

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,110
welcome the you know other than speaking

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,260
the conversations of people as well

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,180
that's cool slide oh I think else a lot

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,310
I they were all excellent questions and

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,310
