Description: 
	Call it a fronted state of the union, call it hot or not in YYYY, call it buzz-word bingo. 
We will talk about how Progressive Web Apps helps the web compete with native apps. How new browser features will transform e-commerce. Whats on the horizon for javascript and for frameworks? and where does typescript fit in? How will Houdini eventually change layout on the web? Whats up with the physical web or what about Internet of Things - and how are those related. Offline, PRPL, Observables, Serviceworker, push-notification, redux, web-APKs, and maybe even moreâ€¦ all packaged up, tree-shaken, server-rendered and served over https!
