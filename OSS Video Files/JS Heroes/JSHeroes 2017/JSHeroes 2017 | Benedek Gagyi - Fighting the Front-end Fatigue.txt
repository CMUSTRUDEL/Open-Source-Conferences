Title: JSHeroes 2017 | Benedek Gagyi - Fighting the Front-end Fatigue
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: JSHeroes 2017
Description: 
	Sometimes the front-end ecosystem may seem, like riding a wild hog in a pitch black forest: it can be disorienting, full of nasty surprises, and even seasoned veterans may find it challenging to hang on. You may think, that if you don't check your twitter feed for a few days, you won't understand what everybody's talking about, but even worse, you may miss out on juicy opportunities to make your website better, faster, easier to maintain and so on. 
I'll talk about the basic set of technologies and techniques one needs to be able to deal with the onslaught of other technologies and ideas you're constantly being bombarded with as a front-end engineer.

so hi everyone thank you

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,369
again my name is Benedict Raji I'm a

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,020
software engineer at LogMeIn and also a

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,520
teacher at training 360 I usually teach

00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,590
front-end technologies to people and

00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,750
today I'm going to talk about front-end

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,509
fatigue and more precisely about ways

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,190
you can actually fight it

00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,290
so for those who of you who don't know

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,960
front end fatigue is actually the state

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,969
of mind when you just sick and tired of

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,130
this blazing speed that the front-end

00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,809
technology is moving right now like so

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,719
many things are coming out you just fear

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,370
that you can't keep up you feel that you

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,399
don't want to learn one more front-end

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,350
technology you feel that you don't need

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,649
to download one more NPM package you

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,659
just don't care and obviously in a

00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,659
industry where a constant learning is

00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:05,300
essential this kind of state of mind is

00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,370
very bad for us so we should try to

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,409
avoid it the whole discussion about

00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,020
sometimes fatigue was started by this

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,270
tweet by Pete hunt

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,729
and while these tweet focuses on the

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,340
learning curve of react it sparked a

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:22,700
really good discussion about the whole

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,070
topic and lots of really good blog posts

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,360
and podcasts and discussions were born

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,310
out of this as you can see this is quite

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,330
a big problem with many many aspects

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,080
many ways to approach it

00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:38,330
for me the interesting part is how can

00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,390
you teach front-end technologies in a

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,280
way that is future proof so how can you

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,150
teach it in a little bit obvious in a

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,790
limited available space of time in a way

00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,710
that people will be able to build on it

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,690
and will be able to keep up with all the

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,850
things that's happening well a simple

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,680
solution for that and something we can

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,050
all agree on is you should get the

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,340
basics right right it's quite simple if

00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,740
you have really good basics you can

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,530
build upon them well the thing is that

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,569
while we all agree is this it's kind of

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,819
hard to define what the basics exactly

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,099
are so a little I did a little

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,190
experiment I created a questionnaire it

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,709
had nine interview style JavaScript

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,540
questions but I wasn't interested in the

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,969
answer to those questions I was

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,989
interested if you think that someone

00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:28,480
with a basic or advanced knowledge or is

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,200
able to answer this question

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,640
so there were more than three questions

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,860
what I'm going to only hide like three

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,069
for you guys the first one goes like

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,810
this what is the difference between the

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:42,610
module pattern and the revealing module

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,110
pattern in the JavaScript world so

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,360
please raise your hand if you're not

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,890
tired already of raising your hand if

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,660
you think that some of its a basic

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:55,569
JavaScript knowledge should be able to

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:57,400
answer this question okay okay you kind

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:59,379
of agree with the people who complete in

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,599
my survey because all the 10% of them

00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,400
said that this is something basic and

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,920
for me this question is interesting

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,200
because a few years ago this was like

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,510
one of the first questions that

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,060
interviews but since then it has become

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,890
obsolete so when you're thinking about

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,239
the basics you have to really take into

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,970
account that the industry is moving

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,190
really fast something that was the basic

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,489
stuff has become obsolete in just a few

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,430
years another question was a coding type

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,620
of clerical question the question here

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,900
is what will be printed by the console

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,329
so again you know that will please raise

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,560
your hand if you think that some with

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:42,970
the basic knowledge should be able to

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:44,350
answer this question okay okay I like

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,540
that you're in sync with the people who

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,549
completed my survey because a bit more

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,040
than half of them said that this is a

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:55,269
basic knowledge and again I highlighted

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,340
this question because es6 is I think and

00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,989
I feel it's right now in the middle some

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,790
people already consider it basic and

00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:07,000
some people still think that it's kind

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,799
of not it's like an advanced topic

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,290
because not all the browser's supported

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,720
in this case of course it wasn't about

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,090
just syntactic sugar you needed to know

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,709
what's the difference between regular

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,810
functions and arrow types for arrow

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,180
functions and how they handle the disk

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,930
keyword the last question I'm going to

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,090
highlight here the question is which

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,520
line will throw a syntaxerror and why

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,810
the problem is that you can't see but in

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:39,430
the second row there's a one more

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:42,479
parenthesis at the end so who thinks

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,479
that this is a basic question

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,970
hmm okay okay this is the first time you

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,730
don't really agree with my responders

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:56,860
maybe because you can see all of it um

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:59,050
the point here was that I think this is

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,430
a great example for things that there

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,410
are many things that we use and we're

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,270
pretty confident in using them but we

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,160
don't really understand we don't really

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,830
understand how it works

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,360
so in this case yeah you know that you

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,840
have to put the parenthesis before the

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,430
iffy but many people consider that you

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,310
don't really need to know why you're

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,150
doing that this is a typical example

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,860
example for knowing what's the

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,190
difference between declarations and

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,320
statements so anyway for me the main

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,580
takeaway for from this questionnaire was

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,560
that it's really hard to define a

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,530
standard and by standard I mean one

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,020
definite basic set of knowledge that we

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,910
can all build on and if you think about

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,620
it this is a kind of a big

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,910
responsibility because every time you're

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,680
mentoring someone you're teaching

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,440
someone you have to think about okay

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,720
from for them in this particular case

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,060
what should be the basic where should we

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,850
start from and and I think that's that's

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,520
a challenge but it's also liberating

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,650
it's a great freedom because you can

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,630
tailor what you're saying for everyone

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,910
you're not teaching them to achieve a

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,890
given level it's not like in school

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,200
where everyone has to pass the same exam

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,040
independent from their background you

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,880
can take into account

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:16,090
everybody's background and and that's I

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,560
think that's really cool but does this

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,590
mean that every time when we're teaching

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,390
we have to build all the lessons and

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,110
everything from from ground up that

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:28,240
doesn't seem really performant not

00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,300
really effective and a spouse said in

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,760
his present is opening talk right now we

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,860
were lacking teaching we lacking

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,610
mentoring so if this process is really

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:45,310
hard then nobody will enter it my take

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:47,650
on this problem is that this is where we

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,960
are right now but in the future it will

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,200
get a lot easier because we get more

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,610
experience in teaching JavaScript just a

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,080
quick test how many of you have learned

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,110
JavaScript at the University

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,270
again hands off I promise this lesson

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,370
not too many people right so most of us

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,930
learn JavaScript by ourselves and

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,270
there's no problem with that it's just

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,610
that we don't really have experience in

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,860
teaching it two-dimensional in this

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,139
presentation that Stanford just

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,759
introduced javascript to their

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,129
curriculum and it's a big it's a big

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,930
thing like Twitter with all of it like I

00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,509
hope in a few years we have a lot more

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,689
experience in this topic and we won't be

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:28,479
amazed by people teaching JavaScript and

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:31,930
in the same time I think we should share

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,150
more of our experiences like I I come

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,729
from a background where I usually teach

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,319
in the classic way like like I'm

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,180
standing in front of a class but there

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,849
are a lot more many ways to do teaching

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,469
and even even a simple situation when

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,479
you explain something for a colleague

00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,629
and they don't get it for the first time

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,610
then you kind of realize which are the

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,319
hard part where you should focus on and

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,419
I think we should share this information

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,849
if you could share it we could get

00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:59,469
better at teaching so right now I'm

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,349
going to start I'm going to share my

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:06,759
experiences from the last two years of

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:10,509
teaching JavaScript be aware this is a

00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,270
really subjective part so I'm actually

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:16,029
looking forward on sparking discussions

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,490
so if in two weeks a meeting will be

00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,469
full of articles telling how wrong I was

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,379
I will be really happy because it means

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:25,509
that we started the discussion so anyway

00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:27,669
in my experience the first thing you

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,620
should do and it doesn't matter if it's

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,870
there are the people who are you're

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,159
teaching or two to beginners or really

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,750
good programmers but they don't know

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,789
front-end technologies the first thing

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,529
you should do is give them really basic

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,529
building blocks just to give them

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,909
something they can try out something a

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,190
way to build something that works

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,140
because these early successes are really

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,970
important to get traction with the

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,970
technology if it's very hard it takes

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,790
like weeks to even make the simplest

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,880
application you won't really feel that

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,740
motivated to actually learn it so in my

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,420
experience in the front-end world and

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,399
especially in the JavaScript world the

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,050
building blocks are code literacy

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,510
obviously you need to be able to read

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,190
and write the code working with basic

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,380
Dom elements using Ajax

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,300
preferably promises as you heard a few

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,680
minutes ago promises even though that

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,050
async/await is coming are still

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,870
important i think away debate is based

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,509
on promises so i think you should

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,389
definitely learn them and also some

00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:28,790
really simple basic performance concept

00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:32,240
like how the event loop works how a sync

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,060
works really from very really far away

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,079
how the garbage collector works okay but

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,550
you you have a bunch of Lego blocks you

00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,649
give it to two different people and

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,949
they've you build two different castles

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:48,319
using the same blocks so I think when

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:51,079
when you're teaching you have to really

00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:54,350
pay attention to the people to your

00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:58,759
target audiences background so here I'm

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:01,069
going to share a few experiences for me

00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,980
it was a surprise that for total

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:07,339
beginners are starting out with es6

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,440
syntax was easier but to think about es6

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,509
is a lot cleaner syntactically a lot

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,250
more logical and they have the time

00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:15,139
later on in their careers to actually

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,730
learn the historical reasons why

00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,920
something is like that something is

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,370
different they have time for it right

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,920
now

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,769
ES 6 even though by the question it

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,449
wasn't so many people don't think it's a

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,779
basic knowledge I think it's really

00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:31,970
useful for them also I saw that for

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,600
total beginners the fact that in

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,430
JavaScript functions are first class

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,019
objects is a bit confusing so the fact

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,670
that you can return them and do all kind

00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:43,370
of magic with them is a bit tricky I

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,980
usually put a bit more emphasis on that

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,500
also what I don't really like to do is

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,449
do a lot of deep dives into topics so

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,819
for total beginners is a lot more

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:55,639
important to be able to start to be able

00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:57,230
to start coding get going it's like with

00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,269
driving when you're learning to drive

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,819
you don't start out with learning how

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,500
the motor works how the car is built you

00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:04,939
start out by actually driving and later

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,560
on if you want to become a race driver

00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,410
you need to learn all that stuff also

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,589
but at the beginning I think going

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,269
really deep is not that important

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,769
another group of people I have

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,010
experience with is people coming over

00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:21,030
from Java C sharp sweetest ass so people

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,180
are usually used to

00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,800
classical Opie languages here are one

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,620
thing I like to put a bit more emphasis

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,990
on is the scope the disc keyword how it

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,670
all works working with objects because

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,800
usually people coming over from these

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,660
languages are really class happy they

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,780
like to solve every problem with a new

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,970
class and in JavaScript being a bit more

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,250
dynamic language there are a lot simpler

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,670
and more elegant ways to solve this by

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,950
using simple objects also I heard it so

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,420
many times that javascript is not even a

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,790
real programming language because it

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,770
couldn't get classes right no they

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,080
didn't want to get classes right

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,000
javascript is a prototype based Opie

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,650
language and the difference between the

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,720
two although it's minor and although

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,000
it's although it's kind of hidden with

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,910
the es6 class syntax it's still there

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,760
and I think it's important to be aware

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,450
even on a high even if it's not only a

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,880
high level that there is a difference

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,870
you may have seen observe that I didn't

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,860
mention a few things

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,750
one group is the tools I think that the

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,820
tools are the fastest to come and go so

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,580
when you're when you're teaching when

00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,500
your point is to kind of protect people

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,540
from the jealous six JavaScript and

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,990
front-end fatigue you don't really need

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,000
to talk for them about tools it's like

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,920
when the junior programmer joins a team

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,570
they don't really need to understand how

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,300
web but first they just need to know how

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,820
MPM start should be typed and enter and

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,560
that's it later on later on Taney you

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,470
need to understand it indeed they will

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,540
need to learn it but at the beginning I

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:58,220
don't think it's that important another

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:02,130
thing I didn't touch was frameworks

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,250
the thing with frameworks is that if if

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,740
you know that a given target audience we

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,600
use one framework then go ahead teach it

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,940
to them but if you don't know what they

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,030
will use I think going with one

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,650
framework and then immediately after

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,990
going with another one is really

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,850
confusing instead I'd go with the

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,890
building blocks that build up to the

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,390
frameworks for example for angular 2 I

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,410
talked about Eric's GS observables

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,810
typescript stuff like that

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,310
how decorators work so the building

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,490
blocks they build up the framework so

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,750
when they actually arrive

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,240
that point where they have to learn

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:43,899
about it they already know all the sub

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,930
things that we love the big picture my

00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:50,480
my topic is titled fronting fatigue and

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,160
I haven't talked about CSS and the

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,209
reason is that CSS is kind of a

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,620
different kind of animal meaning that

00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,180
there's a there's a saying one my

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,130
colleagues if you say this that you

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,700
can't learn CSS you can only get used to

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,830
it and if you think about it that's kind

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:11,330
of right because we have more than 360

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,940
properties there and each of those have

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,550
many many possible values to fill it so

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,910
you can only learn these to experience

00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,950
but I think the basics the real real

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,950
basics are actually really simple and

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,709
while with JavaScript I don't think it's

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,560
easy to agree on a definite basic set of

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,480
knowledge with CSS I think it is I think

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,550
if you understand these three concepts

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,290
then you're good to go you just need to

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,570
build up the experience so these three

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,149
things in my point of view are selectors

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,570
how they work how can you write the

00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:46,850
fishing selectors the Box model and

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,930
positioning absolute relative stuff like

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,970
that

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,290
the thing with positioning is that I

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,209
think you also need to add a few

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,250
patterns like how we solve typical

00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,079
problems you know vertically

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,630
in the middle horizontally demeaned or

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,550
you guys know what I'm talking about

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,829
but with these three tools they can

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,350
start out obviously in a few years when

00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:08,810
we have a full flexbox

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,520
support and support for grid we need to

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,470
add those two because those are kind of

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,779
a bit more complicated and bigger topics

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:18,649
in themselves but right now I think

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:21,770
these three are kind of enough so okay I

00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:24,529
talked about how to teach beginners but

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,790
what about all the other people who who

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,570
are trying to keep up trying to

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,010
constantly see what's happening well

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:36,320
this is again a very complicated topic

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:39,829
and I try to try to cram it up into one

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,870
mathematical formula so this formula

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,610
doesn't have a cool name yet

00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,440
usually formulas have two names like

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,300
cosa Buena Kafka Schwarz and stuff like

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,259
that this one doesn't have one so if

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,879
somebody has a good

00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,639
just tweet it to me and I buy you a beer

00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,859
if I like it and the second thing you

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,720
may see about this is that it's not

00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:59,269
really mathematically correct but I

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,249
think it helps us to envision what our

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:06,979
possibilities are so TSA is time a

00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:10,669
variable for studying VL is the speed of

00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:13,819
learning stuff and MSL is also amount of

00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,739
stuff to learn and if this equal

00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,689
inequality holds true it means that

00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:19,789
you're all right if it means that if the

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:22,160
combination of your time and the speed

00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:23,689
of learning is still bigger than the

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,369
amount of stuff that you think you need

00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:29,089
to learn you're all right

00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:30,379
then the amount of stuff is getting more

00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,049
and more more and you feel that you

00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:35,239
can't keep up that's when front-end

00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:36,769
fatigue happens so if you look at this

00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:39,079
formula you can clearly see we have

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:41,709
three ways where we can affect this

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:44,629
first by making more time for studying

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:46,579
well I think this is kind of like a

00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:50,419
brute force solution and this is like

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,889
the fastest way for burning out but

00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:54,980
sometimes you need it sometimes you just

00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:56,629
have to put your ass down and start

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,470
learning but again this is not a

00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:02,389
sustainable thing but there are hacks

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,309
I've talked to many people and everyone

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,199
has different hacks I'll share mine for

00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:09,919
example I usually watch youtube videos

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,529
sped up and while washing the dishes or

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,720
doing the ironing it's like instead of

00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:16,339
20 minutes it's like 15 minutes and you

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,230
learn something maybe you have other

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,879
tricks like I know people who are

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,149
listening to podcasts while traveling

00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:25,010
the train stuff like that but the point

00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:27,139
is here that this is not where you

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,590
should focus on I think we should focus

00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:32,840
on is improved learning speed this is

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,720
something that this is not a talent this

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,679
is a skill it has to be achieved you

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,409
have to work for it

00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,600
but if you have good basics like we

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:44,330
talked before I think it's easier to

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,000
achieve this so if you know of any white

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:51,169
holes in your knowledge feeling them may

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,789
be you up also an important thing here

00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:58,490
to notice that we have a ton of

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:01,220
resources on the internet that can help

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,970
you learn just type in angular tutorial

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,160
and your

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,650
get like an unlimited amount of

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,700
tutorials which one do you choose maybe

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:12,380
one of these will really be perfect for

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,270
you will be a match for your way of

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,620
thinking and you will be done in an hour

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,490
and another one is kind of really wire

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,870
weird and and you don't really

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,420
understand what they mean you have to

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,300
reread it stuff like that so I think I

00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,880
think that many people miss is actually

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,680
looking to the right selection of

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,500
tutorials and actually selecting the

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,020
ones that are best for you and that I

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,180
like to ask you guys please write even

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,890
more tutorials it's not like we don't

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,990
have enough the thing is that there are

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,210
so many ways to understand one concept

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,430
and so many ways to explain it we can

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,160
always use one more explanation so if

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,470
you had a simple problem that you spent

00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,240
all afternoon solving and you finally

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,340
have the solution please write a small

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,350
post about it post it on Twitter on

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,750
medium anywhere you want it so that we

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,630
can have more knowledge as a community

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,570
about these things and here I'd like to

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,960
make a quick detour and talk about DX

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:12,500
developer experience or how severe

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:17,030
recorded developer efficiency the thing

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:20,240
is here that right now the internet is a

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,980
very big free market like nobody

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,470
stopping you to copy one of the

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,510
frameworks due to small modifications

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,640
call it something else and then publish

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,820
it nobody's stopping you and actually if

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,230
you're you publish exact the exact same

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,660
thing but it's a bit more

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,130
developer-friendly let's go chanted all

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:43,040
the people who were using the other one

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:45,740
we start to use your thing so the really

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,320
good example for this problem is when

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,170
CEOs and leaders are choosing a new

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,090
framework usually the things they

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,120
consider our performance performance

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,640
over everything may be community

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,080
backgrounds stuff like that but my point

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,340
here is that you should also take into

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,700
account how the developer experience is

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:10,640
in my opinion there's always a bit of

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,130
distance between being able to write

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,850
working code in any framework or any

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,070
library and being able to write

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,260
the best possible code in that library

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,450
just think about there are many articles

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,340
that are comparing for example angular

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:29,710
and react speed and the comment section

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,810
is always full of people telling that if

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,470
you do this it will be a bit faster and

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:37,150
if you do that it will be faster for me

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,070
what I read from this is that it's not

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,620
trivial to achieve that performance I

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,960
don't care if your car can go really

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,470
really fast if I can't make it really go

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,350
really really fast so usually when a CTO

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,060
chooses a same worker language they

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,680
think about them themselves but I urge

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,200
you guys to think about all the people

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,290
who are going to work with that most of

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,270
us are not seniors we most of the people

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,590
writing code today don't have that much

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,690
experiences and especially this is

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,700
especially true in JavaScript and and

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,800
front-end technologies so please take

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,990
into consideration how much that time

00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,630
they will need to actually perform good

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,430
with the given technology so if there's

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,370
there's one thing you take away from my

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,560
talk it should be this developer

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,650
experience is just as important as

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,690
performance in my point of view ok let's

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,700
get back to the magical formula the last

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,270
thing you can do is manage your

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,070
background backlog the thing is if you

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,290
if you were paying attention I said that

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,110
this is the amount of stuff you feel

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,790
that you should learn obviously nobody

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,650
is going to come and tell you this is

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,570
the stuff that you need to learn maybe

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,510
your boss here but hey you can disagree

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,870
with him so the thing is that you have

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,700
to manage this yourself and for me a

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,610
really big great breakthrough was when I

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,050
started having a written backlog ok I'm

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,300
not having the JIRA board for myself

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,940
let's be clear but actually writing

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,430
stuff down is really useful because it

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,290
kind of protects you from all the hype

00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,050
that's happening because imagine

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,070
situation your Twitter feed is full of a

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,390
new technology of a new idea if you

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,010
don't have a backlog you start to

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,930
research it but it's complicated you

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,580
don't really have the time then a few

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,140
days later you see the guy on Twitter

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,510
then you feel bad that you I haven't

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,510
haven't really understood that so it is

00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,750
it's like a frustration but if you just

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,680
take 5 minutes to understand how

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,480
important that is to you

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,750
at the moment to give it a priority and

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,850
then put it in a backlog you can chill

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,170
because the next time you have a bit of

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,900
free time you just look at your backlog

00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,600
and see okay what is the most important

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,430
right now for me and that my experience

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,890
is that most of the things that are

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,410
really hyped usually end up at the

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,090
bottom of the backlog and of course you

00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,950
should know about as many things as

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,390
possible but our time is limited and we

00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:00,640
should use it well also another idea

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,630
that I put here is that we should be

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,290
aware of our cognitive biases so people

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,230
usually are even in a subconscious level

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,240
try to defend their past decisions so if

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,820
you you choose something in the past and

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,950
then later on you have to choose between

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,410
two things and one of them we support

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,040
your decision in the best you will tend

00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,080
to go that way so if you pay attention

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,610
to this consciously and you try to train

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,280
yourself in the areas where you're

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,680
actually bad at it will be a lot easier

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,830
to make education educated decisions

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,440
later on and the last idea I'd like to

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,530
share with you is actually an idea that

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,300
I got from a runner he told me that

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,930
sometimes if you want to keep running

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:51,130
you have to stop for a second and just

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:55,390
enjoy and just be patient and look

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:58,000
around and sink in to that moment right

00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,860
now in the front-end world we have an

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,440
incredible speed many things are coming

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,390
and going but if you take one step back

00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,180
and just look around you may realize

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,340
that this is the best time to write

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,330
content code we have really great tools

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,760
huge communities it it had never been

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,540
easier to ship something a feature for

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,880
our users

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,400
so even though it may sometimes it may

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,000
seem like everybody is running around

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,320
headless lee actually it's a really

00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,690
great time to join the front-end

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,400
community so if you if sometimes the

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,250
Teague is stopping you from doing this

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,670
just take a second relax and you'll be

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,570
all right

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,570
thank you for your attention

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,150
we have a few questions I try to be

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,830
quick so you can go in our branch how do

00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,430
you motivate people to learn concepts

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:00,920
and pairings before frameworks well

00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:03,350
motivation is like again a different

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,120
topic because for many people the

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,040
problem is fountain fatigue that they

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,800
want to learn but they feel that they

00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,100
can't for other people it's they lack

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:17,480
the motivation so this is like a really

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:20,390
big topic but I think if you explain

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,590
your points explain that okay even

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,840
though you may feel that you need to

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,730
learn this framework or that framework

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,250
parenting's in the long run will help

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,450
you more I think people will understand

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,200
and obviously this is a very short

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,870
explanation

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,850
you should expand it a bit but I think

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,210
sensible people will understand the

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,770
difference what was font and hunger what

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,100
do we have for lunch I don't know what

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,840
we have for lunch but actually for those

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,470
who think that the front-end world isn't

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,130
moving fast enough right now I think I

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,060
have good news

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,990
it's going to become even more faster do

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,940
you think that there's a strong

00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,400
connection between J's fatigue lack of

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:03,470
sports activity and bad eating habits I

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,090
know it's a joke but actually I think it

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:11,390
there is like like the your motivation

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:15,430
and a hunger for knowledge is can be

00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:19,430
only present when you're healthy like I

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,590
have days when I was a lying with a

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,030
sickness and I just couldn't watch even

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,030
the shortest video because you can't

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,780
concentrate so guys please take care of

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:33,650
yourselves so you can learn JavaScript

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:38,000
in Soviet Russia es6 begins you well I

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:39,620
don't know about it yeah this is does it

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,900
really matter if GS is taught in schools

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,730
or it is more important to know basic

00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,720
program partings and patents oh I love

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,170
this question this is a really good

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,910
question I think for beginners it's not

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,960
important to learn a language I don't

00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,460
care if it's JavaScript

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,129
it's Java C

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,039
for them it's important to get successes

00:26:55,129 --> 00:27:01,309
to get a really really fast to a point

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:04,940
where they can actually make their ideas

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:09,019
real make the ideas happen so when I had

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,659
a nonprofit organization where I was

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,970
teaching people who had no programming

00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,769
experience programming and I started

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,230
with a language called processing this

00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,820
language was created for artists so they

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,340
can create really nice-looking stuff

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,019
with minimal code but it's really good

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,909
for teaching because it has the basic

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,519
concept it has variables loops stuff

00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:30,470
like that but in like I don't know this

00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,419
much code you can program a simple game

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,820
and it was so good to see that people

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,369
actually invested in their code and I

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,840
think the actual motivation comes from

00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,429
the part where you don't really care

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,169
about the code you care about the

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,179
features that you're building when the

00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:48,100
codes are the code is just a tool it's

00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:50,809
just a means so yeah I don't care where

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,600
programming is taught but right now we

00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,090
need so many new people in the workforce

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,330
that yeah also teaching it in schools is

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,039
one of the option is it safe to assume

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,169
that fatigue exists strictly because

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:08,269
budding developers don't have a grasp on

00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:10,570
the JavaScript core hmm I'm not sure I

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:14,210
agree maybe there are there are

00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:17,419
situations where a better understanding

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,100
would help you a lot but I think that

00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,809
right now with the problem the problem

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,909
is actually real that we have too many

00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:26,179
things that do the same thing we have

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,980
too many real systems where the parts

00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,399
are actually glued together with duct

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,559
tape and magic so but the good news is

00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,330
that this is all getting better like if

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,399
you look at the newest tools they try to

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,590
integrate all the things that a few

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,639
years ago we did with different ones so

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,269
I think we're heading in the right

00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:45,980
direction opinions on last at fiasco

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:47,720
don't you agree that most of the

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,429
communities relies too much on MPM

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,029
packages and forgot how to properly code

00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:54,830
by themselves oh there were so many good

00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:57,379
articles about the last at fiasco

00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,149
I don't think I can put anything into

00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:01,269
that discussion like everything was said

00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:04,700
before they are pros and cons of using

00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:06,590
all these NPM packages I agree that

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,720
there's a problem like

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:13,399
last week I opened our product and I

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,679
accounted how many NPM packages were

00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,960
using they're using more than 1,000 I

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,630
agree that that's a bit too much and

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,139
it's not a problem of using yarn or MDM

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:25,399
it's a problem of too many dependencies

00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:27,590
yeah this is something we should work on

00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:29,149
as a community but I don't think it can

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,789
be solved in a few words it's a really

00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:33,309
deep topic do you have a website blog

00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:36,409
where you share your teacher experience

00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:40,399
this is this is the best question

00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:43,129
because most of my experiences I haven't

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,200
shared them yet it's actually when I was

00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:48,169
preparing for this talk it was the

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,169
moment when I realized that we lack so

00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,250
we like this kind of topics there are so

00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,169
many things we talked about as a

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,019
community and teaching is somehow not

00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:00,440
one of them so yeah I will be sharing it

00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:06,110
and please join me in doing so what does

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,820
budding mean I have an idea but I'm not

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,059
sure so I'm not going to make a fool out

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:13,070
of myself you have Google Google it not

00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,870
reinventing the wheel means using the

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,159
same wooden wheel reinventing the wheel

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,090
in the business environment is not

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,669
always a good thing

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:25,070
however when teaching yeah I like where

00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:28,429
you're going with that like I understand

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,879
that taking a fresh look on things that

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:35,059
we consider fixed is a really good habit

00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:36,919
but India in the same time we have to

00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:38,480
stay as performant as we can

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,210
again Paul said in his opening

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,409
presentation that if you invest too much

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:47,809
time too much energy into teaching then

00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:50,330
you're removing that time from something

00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:54,559
else so we kind of have to find a

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:58,120
balance here beginners should start with

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:05,659
JavaScript or ties to what do you think

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:09,740
well I think that's a mmm the thing is

00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:12,320
with me that uh I was I have a Java

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,539
background I was a foster Java engineer

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,399
for two years and then I started doing

00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,730
JavaScript because I like the dynamic

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,100
nature and for me even if the receipt

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,630
shoes are small I kind of feel them it's

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,720
not like not like I hate them but I'm

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,180
not really comfortable with them so for

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,090
me personally the answer is kind of

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:35,270
simple but if you'd asked me to build a

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:38,360
lecture for beginners and I if I had the

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:41,270
time to go into typescript III I would

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,980
go into it because by learning time

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:47,630
script I think you can you get a better

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,910
understanding huh what what's actually

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:52,100
happening under the hood like so many

00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,780
people use javascript and they don't

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,940
even know that javascript has types I

00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,410
think this is something that even though

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:01,720
they you don't have to use them

00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:04,460
explicitly you have to be aware of them

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,400
in general I think typed script is a

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:12,050
really cool direction but I also think

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,180
that it will it won't ever kill

00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,100
JavaScript in total JavaScript will be

00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,600
there for the long run maybe web

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,720
assembly will kill JavaScript but that's

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,430
a totally different topic is front-end

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,730
to figure routing it sounds really made

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:31,430
up well they are fake news well the

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:34,550
thing is that if you haven't experienced

00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,560
it then you're doing something right so

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,230
if you haven't experienced this yet and

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,660
and you feel that all this talk was kind

00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,730
of senseless then please take a second

00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,770
and think about your habits what are you

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,670
doing maybe share them how are you

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,750
learning new stuff

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,980
how are you entering how are you

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,140
introducing new ideas to your codebase

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,040
please share that information maybe you

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,750
found the one solution for the problem

00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,670
is the exact level of details for the

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,010
basics needed isn't it more important to

00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,780
grow a healthy mindset yeah I totally

00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,970
agree with that like like the mindset is

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,520
the most important but on the other hand

00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:13,070
when you have like five days and after

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,220
those five days a group of people we

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,210
start working in a team you actually

00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,570
need to teach them something like

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:23,510
mindset or cool I don't think that they

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,250
can be taught easily but technology can

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,860
be taught even if it's not trivial

00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:31,010
so yeah mindsets are important but also

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,320
please try to teach something here

00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,240
that's on using CLI to teach people

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,149
frameworks or I love this question

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,730
because I had a really good experience

00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:43,309
with learn you node learn you know these

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,559
are actually I'm not sure what it is but

00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:49,010
it's a website where they have very good

00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,990
know tutorials and they have a CLI based

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,149
tutorial and I have such a good

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,399
experience with that like it works

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:57,710
offline it has all the info needed it

00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,600
even had the NPM packages already

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,850
included so if you were working offline

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,440
and one of the exercises needed an NPM

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,260
package you could just copy paste it

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,480
from the tutorials directory I really

00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,070
like this direction and like I mentioned

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,970
before good tutorials are really

00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,300
important

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:17,990
CLI tutorials is one way to create

00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,700
really really really good tutorials how

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,379
do you fight the fatigue of choosing an

00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,780
entire stack of front-end technology for

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,730
a project there are too many of opinions

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,649
all over the web yeah that's that's

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,290
that's a real problem and I start it's

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:32,060
especially a problem when the the people

00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,129
who have to make decision the decision

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,379
don't really have experience in it

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:41,149
because if you have experience you have

00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:44,089
also biases so maybe you have an idea

00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:47,480
which way to which way to go but in

00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:50,240
general I think if you have no idea

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,909
which way to go go in the path of the

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,550
least resistant least resistance go

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,589
where the learning curve is not steep

00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,839
where it's very it's easy to learn where

00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:02,180
it's easiest to start and also try to

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,369
choose something that won't tie your

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,859
hands for too long because everything is

00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,750
changing you have to prepare for

00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:12,760
changing your stack and your tools over

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,760
and over and over again thank you and

00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,140
