Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: JSHeroes 2017
Description: 
	This talk is a practical introduction to production deployment of node.js applications. In this talk, I will share my journey of gaining a better understanding of managing production websites and becoming more confident in delivering solutions that scale. I will go over Node Clusters, MongoDB Replicas, Reverse Proxies, Load Balancers, CDNs and more with demos and real world scenarios of usage. With this knowledge, developers will be able to have a better understanding of production deployments and also learn that some problems can be solved without writing a single line of code.
