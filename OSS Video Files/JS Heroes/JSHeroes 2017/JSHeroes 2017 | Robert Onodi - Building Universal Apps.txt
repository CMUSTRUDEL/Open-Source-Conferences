Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: JSHeroes 2017
Description: 
	The present enables us to build universal applications, that run on multiple platforms and environments. Why should I care to build such applications? Or why should I even care that such applications can be built. 
From theory to code examples, from sane coding to going crazy. You name it.
