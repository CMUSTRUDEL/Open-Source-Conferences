so I have to admit that I was a bit

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,360
anxious about speaking to you because

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm not used to speak to such large

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,330
rooms I was at TEDx last year and it was

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,840
really a challenge for me I'm used to

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,790
play games actually with kids and learn

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:40,290
by playing games it's it's fun and I

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,950
propose to you to not do the usual

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,870
presentation and start with questions so

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,510
please put your questions on slide oh

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,239
because I would like to leave my slides

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,640
for the end in case we need them and

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,670
start with your questions because I

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,010
really believe that learning learning is

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:04,559
a is a dialogue and we have to have

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:07,020
conversations also we have to to play

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,270
games and have fun and I would really

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,200
like to start this conversation with you

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,360
right now so in order for you to ask me

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,150
some questions maybe you would like to

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,170
know more about me than what Powell said

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,470
and what I can tell you is that I love

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,930
communities I love communities because I

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,670
learn a lot in this kind of environment

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,259
and not really keen on speaking about me

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,950
that's why I have this video that

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:44,180
somebody made about me and I'm going to

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:44,180
let you watch it is the sound working

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,880
so hope the internet will help us

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:03,660
meanwhile I can tell you that I have

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,060
like 100 t-shirts at home from the

00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,860
communities I've been involved

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,560
internationally and locally the sound

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:29,510
doesn't work can but can somebody help

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:34,620
me thanks

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:38,130
this is my story I grew up in Romania in

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,239
a small city on the Danube I'm a junior

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,430
developer and an entrepreneur when I

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,180
first started to look to learn how to

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:52,410
code I took some courses online but it

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,140
was not enough and I found this simple

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,980
own program in Paris it's like a dev

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,390
bootcamp

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,120
for people who want to become

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:09,290
programmers developers and Microsoft is

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,299
helping with the license and technology

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,440
the first time of my life I thought my

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:21,150
brain was like twitching very very hard

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,880
and that felt amazing I was hoping that

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,730
I will find a job that I will like after

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,549
my studies actually it didn't happen

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,120
like this and in the end I said I'm

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:37,019
going to do something on my own I've

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,170
discovered myself and what I want to do

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,390
there I have the help of people to do

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,540
that and I would like to bring this to

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:51,150
Romania and help others find their path

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:55,110
also Romania is it's a very interesting

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:58,140
place to be now we are just 27 years

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,209
from the revolution and everything is

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,569
moving so fast

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,690
Chloe is really a young very dynamic

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:11,069
very active there are lots of young

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,319
people with ideas my role now is to show

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,720
these people all the opportunities that

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,479
they have and they can create with

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,239
technology to offer the free training to

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,040
people who need it to be able to program

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:30,660
and use their talent I am planning the

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,960
workshop I'm doing presentation I love

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,560
my job I couldn't do anything else I

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,139
have lots of energy I don't know if I

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,810
will have it forever but now I want to

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,590
use it for helping people that's my

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,680
agenda and having more people thinking

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:53,520
like me and companies like Microsoft

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,919
having the same agenda that makes you

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,919
feel very empowered that makes you feel

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,850
that you are doing the right thing and

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:06,570
that's awesome I don't think I'm saving

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:09,710
the world but I'm trying to empower

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,710
people to do it

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:23,230
[Music]

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,230
[Applause]

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,460
so that's a bit about me and I really

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,220
like that you also have questions

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,010
already so now we can start we can start

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,290
talking about collaborative learning why

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,580
is this important why is collaborative

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:47,270
learning important I think that it's

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,130
very important today more important than

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,710
yesterday it was always important to

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,170
learn and to have communities to rely on

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,770
each other but today we are not speaking

00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:00,440
about AI and we will rely on computers

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,690
we will rely on robots and sometimes we

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,090
are not able to rely on each other and I

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,490
think it's more important than before to

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,520
be able to rely on each other to learn

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,560
more to learn more about how we can

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,310
impact the future through our

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,540
technologies and through our activities

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,880
that's why we are going to speak about

00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,790
collaborative learning and you are going

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,380
to help me with your questions so I said

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,910
that the first there was a question

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,070
about what you can say to us about

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,890
teaching to adults from teaching to kids

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,520
well I can tell you that kids just want

00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,230
to have fun and if you are boring they

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,630
will tell you immediately you have three

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,920
seconds to get the attention the

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:48,050
attention of kids I can say that the

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,960
average time they give to you is 15

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:54,590
minutes so 15 minutes maximum you can

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,380
get with them with being boring and

00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:00,770
trying to speak to them about you know

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,510
coding in scratch and JavaScript because

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,590
we're doing all this we're doing with

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,530
kids from 8 years old and what I've

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,950
learned is that actually adults one just

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,530
more of that and the fact is that the

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,800
way we are learning today and the way we

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,380
are experiencing learning today it's

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,630
just not fun and we are used to sit in

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,990
the chair and wait for somebody to speak

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,360
to us about things instead of just doing

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,520
it in a different way and I think you

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,069
today you should think about how

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,599
you can do this learning experience

00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,930
differently than sitting here in the

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,970
chair and for the organizers of

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,970
JavaScript conference that I really

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:47,419
admire and I appreciate I'm very happy

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,240
to be here today I would suggest that

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,090
next year you do small groups of people

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,940
learning in different in different ways

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,009
I know it's cool to have 400 people in

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,039
one room but there is another kind of

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:05,240
interaction that would generate through

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,360
small groups and conversations so how

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,720
all these teaching kids started was just

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,870
out of curiosity all my path through

00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,800
programming and tech world was out of

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,960
curiosity

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,060
so I'm some I think that you can if you

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,960
are curious about learning things you

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,469
just cannot stop you you to incent the

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,180
boarders of every field I cannot for

00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:31,849
example describe what I am actually

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,110
doing today to my father and it's really

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,240
hard for me to have this conversation

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,089
with my family and in general with

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,849
people because I like doing a lot of

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,860
things I actually like learning about

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,200
things so what everything that I do is

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,950
about learning even being here today is

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,250
about learning from you and how how

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:54,860
would conversation about collaborative

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,940
learning would happen with this virtual

00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,370
panel and my my presentation that I

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,950
thought about at home that would not fit

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:07,070
to all your questions so there were

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:10,790
other questions like thinking about the

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:15,320
I if I can think in some point kids will

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:18,230
start to teach kids well that is the

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,480
main question I have for you today about

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,300
collaborative learning because I think I

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,360
cannot learn I cannot speak more than

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,640
what you can find on Google if you tap

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:35,589
collaborative learning or formats or

00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:41,000
methods and tools to do this but I can

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:43,050
probably talk about ours regarding the

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,870
future of collaborative learning and

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,690
future of the way we are learning and

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:52,440
teaching kids and what's amazing from

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:56,640
what what I see at kids and digital kids

00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:02,670
courses is that so kids take notes with

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:06,510
their cameras kids kids learn by doing

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:10,320
vlog vlogging on YouTube so they spent I

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:16,250
have this kid which is his ten years old

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:21,329
and he spends 80% of his free time doing

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:23,550
videos for his vlogging on his channel

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,910
on YouTube and he is so proud of having

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:30,300
200 subscribers like for him is this

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,970
huge huge achievement that he has 200

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,050
subscribers and how he does is it is I

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:39,899
asked him so why do you do this and I

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,269
said because it's so fun like I I don't

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,250
like playing games what what my

00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,140
colleagues do they play games in their

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:52,410
free time or even when they should do

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:55,709
their homeworks I like video and video

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,510
editing and I can have some adventures

00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,579
with my friends because you know my

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,920
parents don't actually go let me go to

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,620
the mall alone but if I tell them that

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,130
I'm going to do a vlog about it they

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:13,339
will let me go with my with my teammates

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:17,370
so he takes this gang of four guys he is

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:20,820
his very you can find that his link on

00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:24,660
our page Facebook page we are promoting

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,579
our kids actually our kids channels he

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,940
takes his gang and he goes to the mall

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,190
and

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:35,220
in the in the way there he is filming

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,560
short short parts of the what they are

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,990
who they are meeting what is happening

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,560
in the street how cool kludgy is he was

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:46,050
telling me a few days ago that there is

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,600
this church with the great view from the

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,029
tower and today after the course you

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,920
will go there and he will film it from

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,870
this angle because he never thought

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,460
about it but now it strike him

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,760
it's

00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,680
well how kids are learning today so when

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,110
parents come to me and said he's staying

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,500
like for hours watching a youtube video

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,300
I don't get it he's learning or she is

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,940
learning they are learning through

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,610
videos so we have to adapt also the

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,980
content I think kids will teach kids we

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,500
cannot teach kids anymore and I think we

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,649
have to be prepared for this and we have

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,380
to learn probably we have to unlearn

00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:28,020
about the way we learned and the way

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,589
that kids will learn let's see other

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,410
questions technologies what technologies

00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:39,480
do you use to teach kids to code so we

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,880
started we started with scratch like

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,290
everyone we started with coderdojo

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,920
movement which is huge international

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,550
movement everyone is very very engaged

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,190
in teaching kids I hope I will not tell

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,560
you only about the kids but if you have

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,839
other questions I'm glad to take them so

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,209
we started with scratch and then we

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,520
realized that kids are getting bored of

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,890
create very fast they were getting so

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,200
good at it that we had to prepare most

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,720
of them wanted to see real code and

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,490
scratch at that time didn't allow them

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,560
to see the code scratch is working with

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:24,060
the blocks of code I don't know probably

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,660
you've heard of block Li and it's like a

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:32,040
puzzle and they put the blocks of code

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:34,560
together to make games in scratch behind

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,480
there is the JavaScript code that today

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,270
we can see and there are many other

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,279
platforms that kids can also see the

00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,070
code while putting the blocks and

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,630
getting the result one thing that is

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,930
very important for the kids and I think

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,250
it will also work for adults because

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,900
grandparents of kids tell us that

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:57,440
they've started learning to code because

00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:00,660
of their grand nephews grand children so

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,900
they are attracted by games there is

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:08,170
this learning JavaScript with Minecraft

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,980
and many many

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,470
platforms that are built-in immersed

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,580
environment where kids go into this

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,850
temple and they have to solve challenges

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:27,250
while while they are writing code lines

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:30,310
to get to another to a place in the game

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,030
so it's an interactive way it also

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,930
attracts adults we actually use more

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:40,450
than 20 platforms today so if you want

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:45,630
to know more about them we can speak

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:48,430
after all so what I've learned from this

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:53,140
teaching kids and teaching adults is

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:57,610
that we have to really unlearn

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,950
everything about what we know I had this

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:04,690
adult that first time I did the simple

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:07,450
on boot camp in Romania it was a really

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,270
hard experience and deceiving experience

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,210
for me and it was one of the failure

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:17,380
let's say on my list that I couldn't I

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:20,020
couldn't teach adults how to code it was

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,560
because these people were coming to our

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,510
trainings so they'd they they got into

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,350
the boot camp which was supposed to be a

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,910
three of six months intensive program

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,170
but they were not really knowing what

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,700
was expecting expected from them and

00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,250
when they came they were like at the

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,050
University you know I came here so I sit

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,330
on my chair and somebody's going to

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,030
teach me how to code and that was never

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,070
going to happen and it was very

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,870
deceiving for me and for them in the

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,980
same time but it was such a big

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:56,260
frustration that made some people become

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,160
ruby heroes not just heroes and very

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,060
proud of them

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,830
coding today and doing awesome apps

00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,830
useful products that are helping people

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:12,670
let's see other questions how was simple

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:16,390
experience for me besides receiving how

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,520
does this difference my work today

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,110
besides being deceiving it was an

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:26,839
experience of getting well

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:31,910
with failing in my trials of learning

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:34,459
people about different things I I became

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,860
more relaxed about the things not going

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:43,100
the way I wanted I became really okay

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,519
with communities being the curricula so

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:50,000
at the beginning I had this awesome

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:53,630
curricula for people everything was

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,070
logical in like I experienced it was

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,040
very helpful for them they were

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:01,760
non-technical people be aware so they

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:06,669
were people unemployed coming from arts

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:09,829
music geography learning how to code and

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:12,140
we had to learn them the basics so we

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,230
had we needed this framework the

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,480
structure we needed the structure that

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,329
would help them but this didn't work

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,429
even if we worked on it for years and it

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,380
worked in France it didn't work in

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,760
Romania and I've learned that actually

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:30,710
the community you today you can be a

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,640
curricula you can be the framework that

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:39,530
is needed for a new kind of JavaScript

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,000
school I think this is something that I

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,400
really learned from the simpler

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,260
experience and also from another

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,370
community that I've build and I will

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,110
talk later this is the rails community

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,080
when I came to closure I really wanted

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,000
to have rails girls in English but

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,010
besides the rails girls workshops that

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,570
happen once a year and it's about a

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:06,770
weekend where girls from any field or

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:09,650
any age we even have high school people

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,900
we have moms we have pregnant women

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,120
coming to learn rails to do their

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,980
projects besides this there is a

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,970
community so the trainers that are

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:22,700
coming to teach girls they meet up every

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,220
month and they speak about their

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,830
problems last last month a colleague of

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,669
mine was telling me that he had his app

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,590
hacked and he was at the meetup so all

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,570
the guys were getting together and

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,730
trying to solve his problem

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,549
because that was the emergency and that

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:43,870
was the thing that made them learn the

00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:47,240
most during that meeting so the rails

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:51,139
race girls just started as an event we

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,240
had the framework which was online a

00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:56,120
community that was spread or or

00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,220
worldwide put the main things that you

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,139
need for the workshop for how to make

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,299
this this happen even how to get the

00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,519
money from the sponsors so we had all

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:08,539
the framework we just had to make it

00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:10,700
happen in Cluj so again we posted

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:14,299
something on Facebook like who wants to

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,970
be a mentor people got in on Twitter we

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,009
started to be retweeted to get retweet

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,320
from the international communities and

00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,389
even people from other countries were

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,700
willing to come to the workshop in Cluj

00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:28,340
just to have fun during one weekend

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,690
because it was the greatest experience

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,299
for them many people travel through

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,820
these kind of communities they are

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:42,590
traveling and learning in the same time

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:46,220
it's another lifestyle which I highly

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:51,049
recommend to you what I think that

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:54,230
coming learning communities should mind

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:56,809
before besides having fun like I said at

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,549
the beginning is really support each

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,769
other and make sure that there are

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,980
engaging interactions so not like me

00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:06,919
speaking now to you boring boring some

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,289
some people are not even listening try

00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,629
to have more engaging conversations and

00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:18,110
dialogues so other other things that are

00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:22,399
important is that nobody is a teacher I

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,830
should if I am here anybody from the

00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,529
from the room can come on stage and

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,100
teach something I am sure that you all

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,259
have something to to tell to the others

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,720
that is interesting about what you are

00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:40,759
doing and I'm sure you can be a jazz

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,830
hero next year here on stage Romania had

00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,929
and I will take another question Romania

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,480
has the best percentage of women in STEM

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,400
fields what's the secret of Romania

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,550
communism

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,400
fortunately unfortunately I don't know

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,710
but I'm very happy to be to be here and

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,280
to see girls in the room Oh usually I am

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,740
the only girl at the tech conferences so

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,020
well when I go in other countries I'm

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,480
really the only woman in the room I'm

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:15,810
the special guest on the feminine list

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,060
so another question what is the best

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:23,040
weight for self development from a

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:25,980
developer point of view to be part of a

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,370
collaborative learning communities a

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:33,780
community I guess it's the question I I

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:36,000
think you develop yourself and you grow

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,400
when when you learn already so you need

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,880
nothing else than learning to develop

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,360
yourself that's the purpose in itself

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,320
and collaborative learning communities

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,350
have this shared purpose which is first

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,200
of all to learn and second all to have

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:59,880
fun I think these two are the secret

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,300
sauce for every learning community how

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,010
can you start a kickstart an AI a

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,830
learning program for kids how do you

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:14,180
explain complex concepts to kids can you

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:17,700
give us an example huh it's very it's a

00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:22,620
to kick-start a learning program for

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:26,820
kids I think you need people interested

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:30,330
in this so you can find them either by

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,580
doing a meet-up on this topic and people

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:36,030
will join and if you are six then you

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,190
will think out ways of getting to other

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,380
people that were are doing this or

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,590
interested about this globally because

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,930
we are so close like three seconds close

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,180
from any community in this world that

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,500
can help us there are many many learning

00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:55,940
communities online that you find experts

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,900
that can help you with this and about

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:02,020
complex concept explains the kids I can

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,890
tell you that

00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,500
there is a huge amount of materials

00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,320
online is this computer science

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:15,970
unplugged it's really fun so they only

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:19,840
have games that involve movement so

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:24,730
there is one thing about us humans that

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:27,880
if we stay more than 20 minutes in in

00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:31,120
one place without moving our brain also

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,320
starts to get in in a certain mode if

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:38,380
you lift up now if you are moving right

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,350
now your brain starts to work in a

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,280
different way and this is something that

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:49,690
we really apply to teaching kids about

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:52,990
coding is that we always do a break like

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,630
30 after 30 minutes we take a break we

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,300
move we move we go to drink water we

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,670
have a game we always have games for

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,860
them moving games it's very important

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:05,890
because it makes your brain make the

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:09,310
connections different faster it's proven

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:11,200
scientifically I don't have to give you

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:15,850
all the details just search on Google

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,980
it's working so if you want maybe you

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:21,160
want to move now I will count to three

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:25,060
and maybe you wanna just stand up just

00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,940
move a bit and I am sure that you will

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:33,850
get the results let's move all together

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:38,790
in the same time one two three up thank

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,790
you let's move let's lift the hands

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:46,240
so everyone is my leg I don't see any

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:49,270
bored person at this moment the change

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:58,720
is on your faces thank you

00:24:49,270 --> 00:25:00,400
now you can sit down and now because you

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,070
are so energized I'm going to speak

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,390
about the hard part the hard work so the

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,220
developing a community building a

00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:15,250
community and making people learn is not

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:21,460
so easy or fun as it sounds it's also a

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:24,700
lot a lot of work and to really

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,429
appreciate the effort that the Egeus

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,470
Heroes is putting today let's give them

00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:38,110
a round of applause because they are

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:42,630
doing a lot of work Alex how many people

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,630
are you in the community of organizers

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:55,150
eleven eleven people brought here 400

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:57,970
people 450 450 imagine what they can do

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:02,050
with 20 people so join them or during

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:05,860
any other community that you would like

00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:07,870
to support I can I'm if there is a lot

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,150
of work I cannot explain you how much

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:15,400
but any help is needed and any community

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:18,370
can exist only with engagement and

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,700
participation active participation from

00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:23,830
members so nothing of what you see today

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,530
of what you've learned yesterday what

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,190
you will learn today will be happening

00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:35,320
without active involvement from 11

00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:38,170
people think about this what why are you

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,860
here today what are you learning from

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:44,170
here and what are you going to do to

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,010
make sure that this is going to happen

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:51,340
again or more in other communities

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:53,410
because it's only a matter of I want to

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,470
join I want to help

00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,930
this is everything that you have to do

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,300
for now you just have to raise your hand

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:07,180
and say I want to join I wanna help

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:10,270
do this please it's a lot of hard work I

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,820
would like to share a story from another

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,400
community that I've been part of and it

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,020
was also a learning community we've

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,800
learned a lot from each other

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,720
it's Cluj makers community it's about

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,990
the maker space that was missing from

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,800
Cluj and that's also a failure on my

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:31,540
list because it never worked and I think

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,060
we should also learn from things that

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,180
don't work not only from the successful

00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:40,420
recipes those are online you can see

00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,970
them international movements you can

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,270
take the recipe you can apply to Cluj it

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,730
will work but let's see what didn't work

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:51,370
in our case because maker spaces are

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,260
expanding worldwide and everyone is into

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,970
who is interested here in makers

00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:00,850
movement in making things so we have we

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:04,720
have a few people and there are many

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:08,380
many more internationally globally why

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,400
this didn't work in Cluj it was because

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,800
of this stupid thing called holacracy so

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,820
I really believe in holography I love it

00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,880
I love giving power to people to take

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:25,150
decisions and having open organizations

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,360
with open circles and only define the

00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:31,570
roles that people get and things will

00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,990
work magically well not it didn't work

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,540
for us

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,120
it was the chaos it was a mess and you

00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:41,470
know why because people are just messy

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:45,280
and they don't want to clean after they

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:49,060
are using tools that's so stupid like we

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:52,390
have 780 people in our community today

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:55,600
in Cluj and the space doesn't exist

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,880
anymore after two years because of a

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,370
stupid thing like doing the cleaning you

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,320
know it was it was not about paying the

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,270
paying somebody to do the cleaning it

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,530
was the principle that we had

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:11,620
the beginning that we are doing

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,260
everything by ourselves and is as self

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,570
sustainable community that was something

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,000
that we started with so if you start

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:21,430
with the principle you want to work with

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,820
it you want to preach what you you want

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:30,610
to put in practice what you what you've

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:34,900
had as an idea and for us it was not not

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:38,470
working and it's a lesson about how

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:42,390
human beings are having can have very

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:45,850
big ideas and goals but they can get

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:50,020
very far from them because of stupid

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:51,790
fights or egos or simple things like

00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,130
doing the cleaning and there is another

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:58,150
story that I have seen in a documentary

00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:00,550
about amateurs in space this Dutch

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,670
people that wanted to build rockets to

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:07,930
go to space and they've managed and they

00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:13,330
did it in a garage they really build

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:16,000
this rocket that went very a lot further

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,950
than 15 kilometres that they've met

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,830
imagined at the beginning it took them

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,440
three years and after three years when

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:26,530
they did it they got into a fight

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,500
Tippett fight on email about Chris

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:31,720
taking the leader role oh no you stupid

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,210
 I'm not taking the reader role and

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,850
all the community was like what the

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:39,400
is happening leaders were fighting on

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,530
emails nobody knew what was happening

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,450
they just had a huge success everyone

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,430
was speaking about them like these guys

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:48,610
are building rockets in their garage and

00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:51,670
they just completely failed because of

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:55,780
these stupid discussions so don't don't

00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:58,060
forget that big goal that or the the

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,970
vision that brought you there and don't

00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,490
get into the messy things just try to

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,400
solve them or find a solution fast not

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:10,240
not not let the don't let the community

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,280
die because of it we let them we let the

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,070
community online for the moment so you

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,950
can join us on Facebook click makers and

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,170
we hope that somebody else will do it

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,480
one day and we'll have a Fab Lab or

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,790
makerspace

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,130
we have the recipe the business model is

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:30,120
working everything was working it was

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:33,950
proved it's just our group our main

00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:38,610
leaders were not working as a as a team

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:42,720
so sometimes you just have to find other

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:45,300
ways and I'm sure somebody will find one

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,220
day what what are the results so far of

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,470
teaching kids to code I will come back

00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,920
to the questions from time to time what

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:58,740
do they know after the course so kids

00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,980
some of them do just do websites for

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,380
their family business

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,510
some do the app store the pizza they

00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,690
have disgraced the idea sometimes like

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:13,020
repair I want to repair the car by just

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,870
putting the phone on the car and the app

00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:19,710
will tell me what is broken and which

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:22,350
will immediately contact the service so

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,360
they can bring me the parts that are

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:29,300
missing or send somebody to repair it

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:33,270
and sometimes they just want to do this

00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:36,210
flappy birds game so it depends on the

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:39,960
kids there is also different depending

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:43,050
on what they are interested in one more

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,540
last question Homer so to interrupt but

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:49,830
we never have to one more questions

00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,800
doctor this one trying again

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,170
what about offline experiences is

00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,690
essential that kids develop also in

00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:02,280
other areas then computer science how do

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:07,610
you ensure that sure that computer

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,610
science is just a tool programming or

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:17,610
making robots is just an activity it's

00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:19,230
if you love it it's it's really great

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,770
because you'll become better and better

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:26,580
but it's not it's not everything so what

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:29,190
what we do with games and working in

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,250
teams is that we we specially develop

00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,290
the social skills which kids don't

00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,710
really have anymore so they are afraid

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,570
of

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,000
speaking to each other and that is a

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,149
problem that we really have to think

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,669
about they are staying like hours in

00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:47,880
front of the computer speaking to each

00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:52,020
other but when you put them in front of

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,270
each other they are very hesitating

00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:58,440
about talking to each other especially

00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:02,490
when you make them at each from from a

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,399
younger from a bigger kid to a younger

00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,919
kid you to try to make them teach each

00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,899
other this is really not working and we

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,580
have to develop the social skills so

00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:17,070
this is something we really emphasize

00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:20,490
and it's before learning them to code we

00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:24,629
will teach them how to be kind to each

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:27,330
other and how to work together and have

00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:30,960
fun together having fun is really

00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:34,320
important and this is something that I

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,440
would leave you with also to the J's

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,810
heroes come organizers and the community

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,339
think about how you can make this

00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:46,619
experience fun and even more

00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:48,750
collaborative for the next year and

00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,710
thank you very much for doing this in

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,710
Cluj thank you a lot

00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:55,679
