Description: 
	The JS world is a constant surprise. Just look at the recent years and you'll see why. The language itself is maturing and the angles from which we look at it are becoming more and more diverse. We've arrived from 10-year release cycles to yearly feature upgrades. ES2017 is upon us and together with it, a new tool that gives us time-warping superpowers: Async/Await. Come learn (almost) all there is to know about it and how you can start using it today. It's going to be fun!
