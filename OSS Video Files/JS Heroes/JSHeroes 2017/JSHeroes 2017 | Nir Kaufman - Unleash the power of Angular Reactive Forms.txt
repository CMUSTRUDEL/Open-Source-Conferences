okay so good morning everyone everyone

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:25,360

all right cool thank you for let me be a

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,489
part of this event and I want to start

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,180
with something like do something fun

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:52,149
together I want all of you if there any

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,380
developers in the crowd just raise your

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:58,270
hand all right let's go

00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,280
so let's start with them I want you to

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,660
like to close your eyes and think what

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,649
is the most exciting thing in your

00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,690
application like when you're coding what

00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:13,000
makes you really like excited about it

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,160
all right so let's take like a brief

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,500
second about that all right now let me

00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,500
get all of you thinking about phones

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,049
agree with me huh good because my talk

00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,570
is about phones so it's the things that

00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,210
phones aren't excited enough you can I

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:34,540
don't know the Facebook or something my

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,760
name is Daniel I tell you a little bit

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,540
about myself I'm a Google developer

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,810
expert and acting as the head of angular

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,820
in my company and 500 tech which means

00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,040
that all day I'll be sitting there alone

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:52,170
in my angular corner so come talk with

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,939
me bring me food water or stuff

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,979
I'm a worldwide speaker but it's my

00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,290
first time here in Romania in general

00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,479
and you're great people and having so

00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,299
much fun and I just got it so and the

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,430
fun just get started and I'm also

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,350
organized some community events meetups

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,690
and stuff so I can tell you all about it

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,549
after it because we are not here to talk

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,500
about me we're here to talk about

00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:19,980
angular angular a love of phones and a

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,620
lot of companies choose angular because

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,620
how he deals with forms and how many of

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,870
you who are doing angular

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:35,230
all right cool how many of you doing

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:37,900
angular 2 4 5 and where are six the

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,000
phones in angular are very very very

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,430
exciting thing it's so exciting that I

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,069
even wrote a book about angular and I'm

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,439
considering doing it the two of foam

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,650
interest so if you're into tattoos

00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,299
recent talk with me later right if you

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,120
know how me to kiss dude you're here in

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:58,349
Romania I'll do it really just give me a

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
couple of beers and a fool to do it

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,730
let's get started

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,030
phones are complicated but in angular

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,549
phones are actually really simple in a

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,739
moment I'm going to do some crazy thing

00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:13,930
and trying to do live coding as the

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,379
first talk it's probably everything will

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,209
failed but will be as it will be fun in

00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,730
angular we are talking about a very

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:25,060
object-oriented way to deal with forms

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,269
so there is this abstract class named

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,879
abstract control and his job to

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,940
represent a form control in other words

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,400
track the phone control state I'm valid

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,030
and not valid what's my value everything

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,689
inside one abstract class and this class

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,000
gets extended by another class name form

00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:49,569
control which represents a single

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,669
control and two other classes which

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,530
represent two data structures that we

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,769
can put from control inside of them so

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,079
if you take a look at this slide this is

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,530
actually everything you need to know

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,769
about the design behind angular forms

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,519
which is I think straightforward and

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,659
simple

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,810
is there any see shop developers say

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:17,009
c-sharp Java alright

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,009
HP get out

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:26,090
I'm kidding you're kidding if your PHP

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,810
positive and you want to talk about it

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,300
so we can sit after we got a group of

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,159
PHP developers talking about their hard

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,740
life and we're trying to help them you

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:41,780
don't need to live with PHP anymore okay

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,789
if you want to get started with forms in

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,319
angular all you need to do is to import

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,879
the reactive forms module like

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,440
everything else in angular

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:51,080
just bring the module and you've got

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,590
everything you need so this is for the

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,990
setup okay in angular we are talking

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,050
about a state of mind when when we are

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:04,250
building forms we name it a model driven

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:07,130
phone in other words how many of you

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,430
deals with angularjs just let me know

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,190
oh not all of you but a lot of a lot of

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,960
people here in other frameworks when you

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,840
deal with phone - usually work a lot

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,569
with the HTML with the markup in angular

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,669
reactive forms most of our work is on

00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,050
the code side that's the reason we call

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,690
it a model driven phone

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,319
so if I'll jump straight to my editor

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:34,370
and that is a very very basic basic

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,770
angular app I've got nothing here just a

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,840
component with nothing inside of it and

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,560
if I want to start and build the form I

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,819
need to think about the shape of my

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:51,139
phone so let's build a JS hero form so

00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:55,699
we've got a name and maybe age which is

00:05:51,139 --> 00:06:00,740
a number and boolean I can code let's

00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:08,680
hope that J 0 can code and I don't know

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:08,680
maybe skills hp+ yeah

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,030
anyway when you start with the form you

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,980
just start with an interface you think

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,260
about your data model that's the basic

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,970
because once you know which data you

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,790
want to extract from the phone the

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,770
process of actual building the phone we

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:27,780
look something like this I will create a

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:30,600
public js0 form the type will be formed

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,570
group because the form is just a group

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,210
of controls and inside my constructor I

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:42,390
can take this j0 form and instantiate

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,610
from group the formal constructor like I

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:50,010
said before it's a map so now I can make

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:54,840
the name to new form control and I can

00:06:50,010 --> 00:07:01,920
just duplicate it for the age and can

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:05,100
code and skills technically you've got

00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,040
to walk in form in angular so if there

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,100
is anyone here ever used class-based

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,410
language object-oriented style a classic

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,920
language it should be very familiar code

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,960
but there is a lot of boiler code here I

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,120
mean you need to instantiate by yourself

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,160
although all of those objects the

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,080
control and the form group can contain

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,480
another form group and a phone array and

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,580
it becomes very messy so angular

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,860
reactive forms give you a helper class

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,620
name form builder so it can be much more

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,600
easier just to do something like this I

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:47,460
want to group and I want take all of

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:50,700
this just initialize value technically

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,350
we've got the phone I know that all of

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,260
you're very excited right now but keep

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:57,990
it keep it for later to prove you that

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:05,400
I've got a working form I can implement

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:08,910
a submit metal take this js0 form let's

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:13,890
take it the value and log it to the

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:20,160
console okay so the constructor let's

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:21,449
call this submit and hopefully we'll get

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,210
nothing because

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:26,460
got a bunch of arrows because the most

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,710
important thing that they didn't do is

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,710
ask for the reactive force module

00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:42,449
all right now don't worry so if you can

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,639
see I've got a technical data walking

00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:47,070
form I just clocked the value and I get

00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,779
the exact interface I didn't use the

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,570
interface but I've got the data already

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,709
ready to be sent age can close name and

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,990
skills so everything working and the one

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,360
thing that we can learn about this code

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,910
that the phone control doesn't kill if

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,620
you're from element is string is the

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:09,570
boolean is the number I'm gonna treat

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:12,240
them all the same okay nice so we've got

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,600
it from and for a reference I put a few

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,149
slides for you so you can use this my

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,160
slides later to remember this you're

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,779
thinking about the interface and you're

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,730
structuring your phone just like this

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,800
all right let's move forward we've got a

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,529
working form but we want to build of

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,660
course a user interface for it so in

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:36,449
angular want to create your phone

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,110
control instance use a set of spatial

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:44,579
directives to bind those instances to

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:48,240
your HTML so the process again will be

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:51,180
straightforward I'm using the bootstrap

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,839
CSS framework to make it a little bit

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:58,019
more friendly now I'm heading to my HTML

00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,089
I'm going to create a div and this is

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:07,260
coming from bootstrap is going to create

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:09,750
a just a row and two columns you'll see

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,180
later what what I did it and now just a

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,250
simple HTML form so I've got a form

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:20,630
let's make a deal with some CSS this

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:26,570
will be form group here I got a label

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:33,320
for the name okay

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:38,000
and an input type text and some click

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,300
CSS class form control let's take these

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,860
inputs duplicate it so that's one for

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:52,400
the name one for the age the can code

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:58,940
which would be a checkbox and the last

00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:05,080
one was skills okay skills can be to do

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:13,600
something interesting range zero to I

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:13,600
don't know 100 let's say the button

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,050
okay simple HTML nothing angular nothing

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,760
fancy now it's going to to get angular

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,579
and we all realize it

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,040
this is the this is the term the

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:39,329
professional term I'm going to take this

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,850
phone to angular visit and use a special

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:46,399
directive a form group alright and

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:50,010
buying the phone group to this ajs hero

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,790
from instance on my class so I've got a

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,670
form everything probably connected but

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:59,100
we see it in a second it's not enough to

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,730
bind the phone group to the instance of

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,300
this phone group control I need to

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:08,760
register each one of the form element on

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,720
the group in other words you see this

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,180
name age can code part of the map in my

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,839
phone group so each one of my controls

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:24,690
I'm going to use the form control name

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:27,209
and register with the same name so this

00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:34,529
is the name control this is the age

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:42,149
control this is the can code and last

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:46,560
one will be skills okay nothing changed

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:49,079
I want to I want to catch the submit

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,690
event because I'm working with angular

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:55,110
forms there is a spatial event a wrapper

00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:00,209
around the native submit event of the

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:03,420
form so I'll catch the ng submit instead

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:09,560
of the regular submit and I can bind it

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:12,810
to the submit method we put on our class

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,230
so if I go back here we can remove this

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,170
and hopefully when I hit submit I'll get

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,850
the phone with all the values inside

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,820
let's give it a try

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:29,510
my name is Nell of course I'm 22 I'm

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,790
kidding I'm old this is my real age

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:34,830
let's do this Sam

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:39,510
and you've got an object with everything

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:42,750
inside in other words most of my work

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:45,330
here was plain HTML which all of you

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,240
hopefully know how to do the only

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,780
angular part your learning curve of

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:57,050
building this form is this code created

00:13:51,780 --> 00:14:01,560
instance right cool

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:07,920
we'll think it's easy no one you want me

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:11,340
to cut it to go away all right what we

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,500
want to do with forms we want to look at

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:19,440
phones all right we want to validate

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:22,620
forms usually validations in the angular

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,230
it's still simple validator is just a

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,330
function who accepts the value of the

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,180
control you can do something with it and

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:32,550
you can return if everything is alright

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,590
you returning a null object if something

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,100
went wrong you're returning an object

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:42,650
that described the error this is the

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:46,050
theoretical part let's see it in action

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:49,680
angular support the native validations

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,990
of html5 which means that if I want I

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,410
don't know if the edge is required

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,320
I can just use required I don't need to

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,050
learn anything new so I can do it right

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,860
here in the template in the HTML and I

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,200
can also use a JavaScript and use some

00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,870
built-in validators so I'm initialize a

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,170
null value and using static class name

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:17,310
validators choosing the mean length of

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,500
six so right now my name control has a

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:24,090
validation minimum length of six

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,780
characters and here the age has the

00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,580
required validation but you can really

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:34,080
tell something went wrong because we

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:37,590
don't have any any any way to see it so

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:43,110
what I'm going to do now right here I'm

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:46,340
going to bind Nijs 0 dot valid property

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,340
to the template

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:53,320
maybe we'll do another thing let's take

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:59,140
the value and bind it to the template as

00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:04,780
well to do this print it will be a

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:07,300
little bit more nice to see alright so

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,150
now we can see that my form is it's not

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,690
valid it's false let's type sizing

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:17,020
something near is not enough the age is

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,570
requires that I put 18 now is true and

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,330
you can see all the values which mean

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:27,490
that if you want to build a dynamic

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:29,650
template you can just use this and if

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,560
I'm interesting on a specific control on

00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,470
this form group map let's say I

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,930
interesting on the name I can do J 0

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:42,070
which is the phone control please get me

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:46,600
the name and I want to know if it's

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:50,170
valid or invalid I want to know if it's

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:54,100
dirty I want to know if it he'd been

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:56,710
touched I can control a set of firm

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,570
control states so I can use it in my

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,550
code and I can bind it to my template

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:02,589
and use like ng-if and conditional

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,550
templates hide and show some things

00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:10,319
because I've got everything right at the

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:16,089
tip of my fingers all right cool

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:19,569
great I've got only only like a half an

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:26,010
hour left or so where the organizer yeah

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:28,600
half an hour now nine minutes 77057 5748

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:33,990
let's make it right let's wait until it

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:38,200
will be like five minutes and alright

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:40,180
back to the slide custom validations the

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,340
right customer validation should be hard

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,860
because the custom validations and if

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,990
you want to say that something is

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,850
complicated just put the name custom

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:53,980
before written it's become very

00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:56,290
complicated I need to build a custom div

00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,190
tag but it's custom

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,890
let's say that the name let's put this

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:06,010
validations aside I want to write a

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,010
function this function will get the

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:13,929
control and I want to check if the

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:22,330
control dot value just the value right

00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:27,460
the value index index of hero not equals

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,950
minus 1 if every single right and valid

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,070
if not I can return an object and

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,840
describe what's wrong and this is a

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,030
custom validator just a function we

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,429
accept the control you can check

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,350
something is everything all right you

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,090
returning it null object it's something

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,250
what's wrong you're returning an object

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,510
and inside this object you can describe

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,960
what what happened so probably now my

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:54,160
name won't be valid let's check it oh I

00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,650
did something wrong

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,350
index F is undefined because I'm

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,830
starting with a null so let's start with

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:08,790
initial value of just a string refresh

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:14,740
and pray almost index F of undefined

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:18,940
it's values it's not value okay now in

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:26,049
false near let's put an age over here

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:27,610
now hero and true I think it went

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,720
through before but everything seems to

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,280
be work all right

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,990
anyway custom validation just put a

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:45,270
function do whatever you need to do and

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:45,270
that's it now no longer alone

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,180
I just forgot what I want to say so it

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,130
was like a powder all right

00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,290
validation it's not enough because if

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,650
something went wrong usually we want to

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,480
add some styles to it so we already seen

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,790
that we've got like a set of bones

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,220
inside of this abstract class and we can

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,520
check if the foam group or any of the

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:12,280
foam controls are valid invalid pending

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,470
dirty whatever most of the time we would

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:20,410
like to add some CSS to it luckily and

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:24,100
angular is doing it for us if you

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:26,820
inspect this element for example let's

00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:31,810
do an inspect element and take a look on

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:37,300
this input hopefully you see those set

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:41,230
of CSS classes pristine valid touched if

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:46,090
I interact with this form you can see

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:48,220
changing all right now it's valid it is

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:53,980
it starts dirty which control and

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:57,040
looking at which introduces the name all

00:20:53,980 --> 00:21:01,450
right so I've got a set of CSS classes

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,840
the dynamically changing and represent

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:11,710
the state of the control okay

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:13,660
let's go back to the code oh I'm trying

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,710
to talk and call together which is not

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:24,490
possible if you're a man so I'll be

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:27,970
quiet for a second it's not possible all

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,580
right let's see how we can use those

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,740
automatic success classes again it's

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,320
going to be very easy but you just need

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,530
to know which classes angular is giving

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:44,080
you so I can do like inside my CSS style

00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:49,660
if the input is ng invalid do something

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:54,920
horrible like this yeah and if it's

00:21:49,660 --> 00:22:00,470
valid it should be green

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:06,890
and if it's a I don't know and touched

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:10,700
it should be yellow so now it's

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,460
untouched it's yellow it's valid because

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,500
it's not required this is required so

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,250
it's red I can put something here now

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,650
it's valid

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,740
I can type something here until I get

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:25,010
valid hopefully your CSIS skills are

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,730
better than mine but the message is

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:31,010
you've got a CSS as a present all you

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:37,360
need to do is just implement your Styles

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:44,690
in the CSS file which is cool I think so

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:46,790
okay let's summarize let's see what what

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,430
we learn today about France in angora

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:52,280
okay so I'll do the professional

00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:54,920
summarize first and then say a few

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,130
personal words if you don't mind so

00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:04,510
let's start the professional part

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:07,730
angular love forms okay you love angular

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:12,500
if you love angular angular loves you

00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:16,480
back if you love angular and angular

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:21,980
loves you means that you love forms

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:25,190
right so that's the technical part but

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,790
to get serious we just see a slight demo

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:32,060
of how angular and make a building area

00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:35,090
forms and easy task I mean your learning

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,220
curve should be I need to know what is

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,310
an abstract control what is a fun group

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:44,720
and phone control may be a form array

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:47,930
from this point and on your code is your

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,220
phone is written by code so everything

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,340
you're doing inside the class will

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:54,980
affect the user interface on the HTML

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,800
side just a simple set of standard tags

00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:02,090
the phone the inputs we bind it to the

00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,760
instance on our class and that's it so

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,860
you can build great stuff with it and

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,570
you've got great methods to dynamically

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,539
add control to the phone

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:14,120
you can create your own custom phone

00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,149
controls as you thing you can create

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,399
easily custom validations if it's ink or

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:21,769
icing validations and a lot of other

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,980
exciting stuff so if you want to learn

00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:26,779
more about forms first of all you will

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,759
get a slide after it you can grab some

00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,789
demo code that I prepared inside my

00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:35,779
github under the angular reactive forms

00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:39,470
book and there is the book I've written

00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:42,350
and I created a special coupon for you

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,509
so all of you can get it for free so you

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,450
can read and learn everything you want

00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:50,720
to know about forms and if you read this

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,419
book I'll be here until Saturday and so

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,080
we can get together and do this the two

00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:00,830
that I really want to do anyway I'll be

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:04,370
at my corner all day and most of the

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:08,990
night so please come talk with me be

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:12,529
with me all right just don't leave me

00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:15,019
there alone I mean there is no directly

00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:18,039
chakra I I don't have time for Asia

00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,039
thank you very much

00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:30,580
someone the host the next speaker I just

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:40,050
just go away

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:45,850
that's it questions yes questions we're

00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:47,890
well on the screen cool how do I handle

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,930
server validation in angular reactive

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,410
forms to create the costume validator

00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:55,840
and there is a concept of a sync custom

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,240
validator so the validator can go to the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,400
server wait for an answer and the status

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,580
of the control will be I'm pending and

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,380
not valid or invalid and just pending so

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,390
you handle server-side validation by

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,010
sending a looks wet request to the

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,740
server waiting for a response and

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:17,260
related special status for it alright

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:19,780
next is it possible to more bind more

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:25,690
than one object to the form maybe an

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:27,220
array of objects yes next can you work

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,050
error message coming from the server

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:36,250
back to the phone yes next can you

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:39,850
validate only onblur yes next can you

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:42,040
find out where it is how do you reach it

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,510
the phone you've got a method a phone

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:51,420
control that reset that's it

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:54,430
next why is angular so complicated

00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,980
because if it wasn't complicated I

00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,410
probably will be jobless so it's

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,600
complicated because this way we can

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,360
write books about it now I mean angular

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,980
angular is not supposed to be

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,960
complicated it's really depend on your

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,000
background

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,610
angularjs the first version for me it

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,460
was much more complicated than the new

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,920
one the new one is based on typescript

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,350
classes and a lot of very very simple

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,090
ideas of object-oriented programming so

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,010
it will depend on your background I

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,310
personally don't think it's complicated

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:31,720
but down it's very subjective

00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:33,389
well did you use the js0 interface no

00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,529
we're next

00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:39,839
I didn't really it was just for the demo

00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:42,809
but in real project I probably will use

00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:46,440
it to say all right the value of this

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:47,539
form is is implementing this interface

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,259
okay

00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:57,599
our oldest speaker entertainers

00:27:51,259 --> 00:28:00,359
hopefully how can you do you think

00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,089
validations come to my angular corn corn

00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:05,029
corn corn the kernel is in the middle so

00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:08,129
it's very confusing nice really cool

00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:10,019
anyway come come back to come to my

00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:11,729
angular corner and I'll show you a

00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:13,889
wonderful world of validations

00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:15,899
how would you integrate firms in redux

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:17,940
button easily and it's got a great

00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:20,700
example that example I just did a talk

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:24,200
about combining the tool and in my book

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:28,440
you've got a chapter dedicated to think

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,909
angular forms with redux so I can tell

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,789
you about it I can show you some demos

00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:35,879
and you can read about it in my book all

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,300
right that's it all right thank you very

00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:42,160
much

00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:45,309
[Applause]

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,309
