00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:16,260
hello so it's really cool to be here

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,779
this is my first time in Romania and

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,100
it's really nice people are also really

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,330
nice and I've learned some cool words

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,660
like salute

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:30,449
so salute my name is Eva's fan Horner

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,960
which is quite hard to pronounce so you

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,350
can also call me Eve Ives and for some

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,850
reason my friends call me Flip so if you

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,710
want to call me Flip that's also fine I

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,690
mean my heart is he my name is even hard

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,410
in the Netherlands so that's already

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,329
tells enough I'm a software developer at

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,640
an auction website called cata wiki and

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,219
I'm also a computer science student at

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
the University of Toronto you can find

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,390
me on social media under the name

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,350
computers and I have a website if you

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,460
saw cool it's written in angular 1 so

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,770
definitely check that out it's the

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,760
future so I'm going to talk about code

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,790
sandbox and I want to ask one other

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,270
question who of you have used coats and

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,229
books before that's really cool so I can

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,100
just walk away now and be finished now

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,450
before I'm going to talk about coach

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
netbooks I want to tell you this story

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,630
behind coach that looks like whoo it how

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,400
it started because I think the journey

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,979
is most important for like an website so

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,710
about two years ago I was on a vacation

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:42,360
to st. Ives and guess why we went there

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,560
my name is in it so I was there and I

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,649
was still working for cata week II

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,920
full-time and I was converting the Ruby

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,320
on Rails pages to react and we did it

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
with a team so at the time I didn't have

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,710
my laptop with me at st. Ives and I got

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,670
a lot of questions from my co-workers

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,469
about react specifically or about how to

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,810
build react with Ruby on Rails in

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,250
combination and I didn't have any way to

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,530
answer them because I didn't have my

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,170
development environment with me so they

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,849
sent me code snippets on slack I had to

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,969
run them through my Eva's interpreter

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:18,549
and that interpreters much worse than v8

00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,730
I have learned so much today about v8

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,650
and I had to give them the answers but

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,400
that I thought would be the solution but

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,950
it didn't work so I started thinking

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,180
after a few beers like what if I would

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,730
have my local development environment

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,889
everywhere and the follow-up question

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,819
was well if I would have my local

00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:42,819
development environment on the web so

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,620
that is an idea and like everyone I put

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,719
it in my idea box and didn't really do

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,329
anything with it I started going to

00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,239
university I started getting lectures

00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:54,370
and I felt so unproductive I didn't

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,310
build anything anymore because I was a

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,109
student so I kept thinking about this

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,739
idea but didn't really do anything with

00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:04,449
it but I reached my peak point of

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,150
unproductivity when I started getting

00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:10,260
Java lectures at that point I was so

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:16,620
desperate I had to build something so

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,090
that's when oh oh we're already too far

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,009
okay so that's when I started building

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:26,290
like a mock-up in sketch and it's quite

00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:28,030
simple you have like do you have to edit

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,349
around the left preview on the right you

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,790
have some buttons on the left and you

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,560
can click on them and you would see new

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,509
components and note the name react

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,049
sandbox that was the first name but we

00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:40,689
decided later on code sandbox so the

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,000
next next year I started building it and

00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:45,669
I was already super happy with this

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,620
because with this you had like this code

00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:49,090
on the left and if you started typing

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,759
then you would get a live preview on the

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,139
right and we I found out super cool so I

00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,939
got more enthusiastic and more

00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,040
enthusiastic and I started to get

00:03:54,939 --> 00:04:00,519
building more and more and more features

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,159
and it started getting really big

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,620
because when you get one job for lecture

00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,680
like university has unlimited java

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,189
lectures you'll have them for ages so I

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,289
had enough time to work in code sandbox

00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:19,120
and at some point we reached the point

00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:22,180
that I was thinking like whoa this is

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,279
already getting pretty cool maybe other

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,110
people are stuck on st. Ives as well and

00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,699
might use this

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,830
and that's when I started getting my

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,719
friend boss to join me and we started

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,750
building the code sandbox as you know

00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:38,979
now and almost exactly one year ago we

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,870
released it as a react editor and to

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,250
clear up any confusion were not only

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,919
react editor anymore we have like

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:49,900
pre-act angular's felt a few react so

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,439
let me just show you because this is

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,939
still a pretty vague concept the first

00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,729
thing I want to show you is the home

00:04:54,939 --> 00:05:03,159
page because it says full and hem for

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:09,699
the next one that's so fun I spent a

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:14,860
week on this and we have vanilla so let

00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:18,340
me just show you the editor so this is

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:22,990
the editor and like your local editor

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,909
you have like this code you have some

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,099
files that you can see you have

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,319
dependencies you can add NPM

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,419
dependencies and use them the new thing

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,759
here is the preview on the right you

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,740
have a preview that you can like play

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,810
around with and if you change code like

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,610
hello cheers heroes it will update and I

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,430
can also use my Romanian language

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:51,490
knowledge so hmm zoom in oh yeah let's

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:56,919
make it a bit bigger this is big enough

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:59,500
for everyone okay so this is what code

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,330
sandbox is and quickly after we release

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,939
code sandbox it became more popular than

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,289
we expected apparently there are so many

00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:09,009
people stuck on Sinai's it's

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:12,219
unbelievable and we started setting up

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,589
values to like set a direction in which

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,599
way we want to work on so we have three

00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:18,159
values we have lowered learning curve we

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:20,050
have encouraged sharing and discovery

00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:23,680
and we have give a local editor

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,689
experienced rate mark and I want to tell

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,639
you this talk I will explain the values

00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:31,120
of code sandbox and what we do for it I

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,949
will also explain some new feature that

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,669
we deployed a month ago called code

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:39,740
samples life and I will also tell how

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:42,090
code sandbox works internally

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,520
the first value is lower the learning

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,520
curve and I find this one very important

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,460
because when we started building cosine

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,199
books it was quite we didn't have create

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,210
react tab when I started building it so

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:59,009
people were overwhelmed with the

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:01,439
JavaScript fatigue and it's still like a

00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,840
small issue like if let's imagine you're

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,310
starting to learn web development the

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,250
first thing you have to do is install a

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:10,500
code editor then you have to install the

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,870
terminal and learn the terminal then you

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,389
have to install NPM or maybe yarn I mean

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,979
you have to make a choice and you have

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,689
to do all these things before you can

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:21,479
even start building an application or

00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:24,240
editing an application and this can be

00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,340
quite like cumbersome it can create

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,919
friction and it would be super nice if

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,169
you could just go to a website and start

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,789
editing like the white text and see an

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,889
update without setting up any

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,330
environments then later on you can take

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:41,729
it offline and continue offline if you

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:43,979
want to Dan Abramov had a quote I think

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,029
lost half a year ago configuration

00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,599
should not stand in a way of getting

00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:50,069
started I altered the quote I made it

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,069
installing tooling should not stand in

00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,599
the way of getting started so I think

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,710
you should first if you want to learn

00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,000
web development then you should do the

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,860
web development first before you decide

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,949
that you want to continue with web

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,779
development if you want to find it out

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:07,199
but with code sandbox we are like in a

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:09,569
unique position because we support the

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,580
whole context we have the files we have

00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,529
the editor we have to preview we know

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,229
everything about the whole project so we

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:20,370
can do some interesting stuff so I have

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,750
a nice project here it's readable and of

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,919
course it's a counter I mean everyone

00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:28,259
builds counters apparently so the first

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,979
thing if I try to increment this you can

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:35,729
see that we have an error and we show it

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:38,250
in both in the editor but also in the

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,899
preview like we use an error overlay and

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,849
if you are like in a different file and

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,250
click on it it will open the file so

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,610
this one is pretty easy to fix I would

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,180
do something like this and now the

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,180
counter works

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:57,710
but I don't really feel safe using this

00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:02,150
I'm a millennial so I should probably

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:05,420
use a library or something to do this so

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,040
this is another good example we know the

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,590
whole context we know all dependencies

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,960
we know the whole preview

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,300
we know all the code and we can detect

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,950
oh there is a missing library and we can

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,110
show suggest a solution like at load

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,330
assess dependency and when you click

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,240
that it will add lodash as dependency

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:28,570
like you expect and I can use the save

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:31,490
form of adding numbers and it also works

00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,790
another example specifically for react

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,530
is the raw module example many people

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,180
have done this I think that they create

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,980
a module without an extension and then

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,320
they try to use as a react component and

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:56,810
if you do that I wish I was as fast as

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:59,180
Keita here like this you will get an

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,830
error because you're trying to use a

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,890
string as a component because this raw

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,630
module will give back a string which and

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,970
it's quite and like this is the original

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,500
error and it's quite like it's confusing

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,750
it doesn't really say what's happening

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,940
but because we know the hole we know the

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,150
whole context we can actually transform

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,500
the end the error and give like a more

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,440
friendly error like it seems like in

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,000
ecstasy as is reporting around module

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
counter and we can show a solution like

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,170
rename counter to counter that yes and

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,760
if you click that it will rename it and

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:37,940
it will work where is my slides there it

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,640
is and we also try to interface files

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:45,920
everything like even talked before its

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,440
UI I mean humans are visually focused so

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,090
if you show a UI it will be much easier

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,880
for people to already understand

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:56,330
something and we do this for example

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,430
configuration if you have like prettier

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,290
RC we show a configuration that will

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,320
generate a config file instead of

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,400
showing this we show this by default and

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,720
you can change it

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,750
and also for example for adding

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,790
dependencies you can just use at

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:15,170
dependencies using a UI you can even

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,900
select a version so that will also make

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,160
it easier for beginners to get started

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,260
the second value is encourage sharing

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,910
and discovery and sharing is already

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,100
quite obvious I mean we're an online

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,560
editor so if you build something then

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,270
you can just copy over the URL give it

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,900
to someone they can fork it and they can

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,029
continue but in the case of discovery

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,029
that's a more interesting one because

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:42,770
with discovery right now code semak's

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:45,110
has 300,000 like web applications hosted

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,710
on it and it would be super cool if you

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:55,670
can just like search for them in a very

00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:58,790
easy way haha surprise you can so this

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,000
is our search and for example if you

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:04,220
need help with you don't know how Redux

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,380
works then you can filter on the

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,570
dependency of Redux but if you want to

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,730
like know how it works in combination

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,800
with react router Dom there can filter

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,920
around that as well and you will see all

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,050
the different projects that have both

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,660
dependencies so you can find examples

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,850
and you can learn from others work how

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,850
everything plays alarm

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,200
[Music]

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,430
you can also embed any example anywhere

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,990
you want to so if you have like a cool

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,060
example you can put in a medium you

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,240
could put it on your website and even

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,470
people can edit inside the embed this is

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,180
like an embed and you can do whatever

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:52,149
you want so that is also a good way for

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,070
sharing with others and we support

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,140
importing from lots of different place

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,089
so if you have like a local project and

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,459
you can put it any you can get it on

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,010
code sandbox the one that most uses

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:05,500
import from get up if you have a github

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,959
repository you can get the last part of

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,390
the URL paste it after the code sandwich

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,820
with IO / / github and you will get a

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,470
sandbox project on code sandbox that is

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,480
synced with the github repository which

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,670
means that if you make commits on github

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,250
it will automatically update the sandbox

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,500
as well and if you make a change on code

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,630
sandbox you can also do commits from

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,079
code sandbox to get up so it goes both

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,690
ways we also support exporting with the

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,880
CLI you can install code sandbox and

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,820
then deploy to code sandbox you get a

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,209
URL back and we have an API so you can

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,190
use do a postmessage and get a sandbox

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,980
back and there's also a library react

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:49,240
code Sam boxers by no-no vine no Feeny

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,699
and that one is also a way to create a

00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,380
sandbox the last one is give a local

00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,029
editor experience and I think this one

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,589
is most important because we don't want

00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,990
to create any friction between local and

00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:01,240
online so for example if you have like

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,640
if you're starting on code sandbox and

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,050
then later on take it offline then you

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,390
don't want to learn a whole new

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,339
environment so it should look like code

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,310
sandbox as well or the other way around

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,620
and we do some pretty cool stuff here

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,779
like we have just testing just

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,779
integration so you can in a visual way

00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,519
you can see all tests and you can click

00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,589
on the test file and see all tests

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,930
inside the test file and run tests and

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,370
we also have get up committing an

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,440
opening pull request and we have

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,209
deploying to site so you can just deploy

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,250
any code sandbox sandbox

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,860
as a production version to decide and

00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,620
I'd love to demo this this is like the

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,230
most fun thing to demo but I ever have

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,390
found like a riskier demo so I wanted

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,400
them with that

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,520
it's called code sandbox life and we

00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,230
released this three weeks ago it's like

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,840
like the name says it's like real-time

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,600
collaboration in the browser so you have

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,640
a sandbox and you can open it up for

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,320
everyone like a link and they can join

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,060
the sandbox and start real-time

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,970
collaboration like editing at the same

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:08,230
time and it was super fun to build this

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:09,850
we've built some oh we're going it was

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,650
super fun to build this we've built some

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,570
really strange stuff with some friends

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,000
while testing this like I don't know

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:18,850
what this is and we made some really

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,890
strange stuff on there and we have two

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,140
modes we have open mode and we have

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,180
classroom mode open mode is like

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,250
everyone can edit but this can also be

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,100
used before for example full for

00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,830
workshops like you're an instructor and

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,980
you want to have 50 people join in on

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,950
the sandbox that can be a bit chaotic

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,300
so with classroom mode you can say you

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,420
can add it you can add it and you can

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,280
add it and the people that join can also

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,690
fork along the way so they can branch

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,690
off in their own version if they want to

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,130
continue in their own their own work so

00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,370
you can probably expect what we're going

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,860
to do this is the riskiest demo I've

00:15:54,370 --> 00:16:02,970
ever done I think so

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:05,710
that's why I'm nervous all day okay so I

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,770
will open up my counter for editing I

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,770
can press go live I will get a URL I

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:17,800
will send it to my friend bus as well

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:20,380
who is in the Netherlands and if I can

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,740
zoom on this people can join up now if

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,280
they want to this is tricky I know I

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,970
know

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:32,800
I won't I won't put it open for love

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:43,210
yeah we have some people yeah oh boy

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:45,100
what's happening yeah okay now I'm going

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,850
to put an in-class remote so I can

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:51,700
select who can edit but one thing I want

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,310
to like show is like if I make a baktun

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,140
an editor and if you like put your

00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:00,580
cursor somewhere like a

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:04,320
on the counters or something oh yeah

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,030
it's gettin it's gettin hot in here oh

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:14,050
how is he they're working okay

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:15,610
that will skip this part but Cosimo's

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,230
life is great for collaboration and like

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,420
if you have jobs interviews or those

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,720
kind of things i generally like

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,400
encourage everyone to do it for work if

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,080
if you're doing workshops put on

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,720
classroom mode because people like kids

00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,490
will join in so code sign box is now one

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,640
year old and we've had a lot of growth

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,340
in the past year it's grown insane and

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,770
it's like a last month we had 62 million

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,110
requests a month which is a huge amount

00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,720
for us but the cool thing about this is

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,580
is that since like like until last month

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,750
everything was running on a forty dollar

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,950
server with four gigabytes of RAM so

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:55,510
what do we do

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:57,910
well everything is local so all the

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,520
preview that you see is not happening

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,130
actually yeah not on our servers I mean

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,580
we bundle everything in the browser we

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:08,320
use your browser to like to do the

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,480
execution because it's JavaScript it can

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,550
run in the browser but still there are

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,070
some challenges I can do another demo I

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:22,980
want to just show you that it works like

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:27,310
if I open new and put up go of line Oh

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,900
what am i doing now you see it can still

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:33,730
update everything so it's like it's like

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,670
yeah real-time collaboration no it's

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,740
like offline support but there are some

00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,800
challenges like we need to do bundling

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,320
but we also need to support NPM

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:50,530
dependencies and everyone knows how big

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:52,570
node modules can be so imagine imagine

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,360
everyone is talking like we need to

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,880
reduce our bundle size to with 500

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,950
kilobytes and we are like oh yeah the

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,120
default create react app has 158

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,250
megabytes so you'll need to download

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,020
that on your phone no that's not that's

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:08,170
not that's not very nice

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,570
that's a bad UX so we have a solution

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,549
for that let like imagine Evan

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,860
average phone has a 3G connection and

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,419
needs to download 158 megabytes it will

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,980
take three minutes and we need to put

00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:23,730
everything in memory it's impossible so

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,230
they'll need to wait like three minutes

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,960
but there is a solution and we've had

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,490
like four iterations before he came here

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,779
it turns out that if you have a node

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,279
module if you have a dependency 99% of

00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:39,429
the time the dependency is not using all

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:42,580
files so what we do is when you request

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,799
a package we go on the server we install

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,960
the package and from the root file the

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,730
main entry point we start checking for

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,830
all required statements and we're

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,059
building a whole graph of all the files

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,230
that are required by the required

00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:58,929
statements and we'll only use portion of

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,090
the dependency a very small portion

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:03,129
actually we put this in a JSON file and

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,779
cache it so when in the future someone

00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:07,210
asks the same dependency we can just

00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,409
give the cached version back but what if

00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,149
someone wants a combination of

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:13,720
dependencies and this is a very normal

00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:17,440
use case right well we do the same thing

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,970
i mean those are service functions so we

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,039
package them separately put them in

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,710
cache then another function will just

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,500
combine the dependencies do some version

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,169
resolving and also put it in the back in

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:34,000
the cache and give it back and this

00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:36,600
takes now we only have 250 kilobytes of

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,190
dependencies to download for this case

00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,850
but it's not perfect let's let's say you

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:46,990
want to use an icon library like react

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,309
icons no one uses all icons of an icon

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,210
library except if you're building

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:54,250
documentation for the icon library so

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,679
you're probably only used like 6 so in

00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,620
this case we don't include all the files

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:03,639
to the bundle we actually almost include

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,190
nothing and if you need a if you need a

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:08,110
icon then we will first check the whole

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,460
file tree which we can do with that call

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,559
then we'll get the whole file tree of

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,549
the library and then we will only

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:17,110
download the necessary file and that's

00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,899
our kind of solution for dynamic

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,070
dependencies for n if like the system is

00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:23,610
missing something that we can still

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,430
download it dynamically

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,120
so I was thinking it would be super cool

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,080
if we would be able if he would like

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,410
everyone would be able to use his

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,910
browser based bundler so I started

00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,260
thinking about a name like we could make

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,590
this a library and we could give it a

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,380
name and we're kind of packing

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,360
JavaScript on the web in the browser so

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,690
I was constantly thinking maybe we could

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,990
use this name but apparently some people

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:56,280
already took that name so I was not able

00:21:51,990 --> 00:22:01,230
to name it we decided to name it

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,480
sans back because code Sant box back so

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,030
you have like sand pack but it's still

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,860
better so we call it smoosh back for now

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:14,880
oh because there's a hold I love every

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,460
word with smoosh in it so yeah we're

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,440
calling it smoosh back and it's super

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:24,960
simple Oh sometimes this clicker is like

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,510
going the other way so it's quite simple

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,170
you have a manager from smoosh back and

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:34,530
you can initialize it with some files on

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:37,170
a element with an ID and we will render

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,120
a preview of those files there and you

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,940
can use like NPM dependencies you can

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,680
use multiple files and it will render it

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,780
and we can also you can also call update

00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,850
preview and then it will do a hot module

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,590
reloading automatically and give you

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,410
back the new preview but it's much

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:58,470
easier to see what it is with a code

00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,660
like a live code example so this is code

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,440
sandbox in code sandbox this is pretty

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,870
confusing this is very meta so we have

00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,100
this index code and second module code

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:14,460
and we create a manager on the element

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,960
with ID app and we say renders in index

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,410
code which is document the bodies of

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,510
inner HTML suu ID so we can also for

00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:23,510
example change this to like import

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:33,450
styles and CSS and it will become red

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:35,130
because this body color is red it has

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,380
all the things that code sandbox has

00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,940
almost all the things like think

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,500
transpilers so you can use sass last

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:45,810
stylus typescript few files it has NPM

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,580
support for NPM dependencies module that

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,370
hot hot module reloading and also the

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,290
API of web pack offline support it's all

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,900
on a serviceworker so you can use it

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:56,730
offline web pack loader syntax like raw

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,830
loader the error overlay we have code

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,270
splitting so we only use the files the

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,940
transpilers that you actually use in

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,410
your preview result caching and HTML

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,810
entries so this means that you can do

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,970
for example a partial template one thing

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:12,720
that I didn't add is we also support

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,790
just testing and we also have react

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,040
smoosh back it's like a wrapper around

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:19,770
it and it allows you to use components

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,450
with sand pack so you can have like a

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:25,010
sand pack provider give it to files and

00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:27,870
dependencies and entry and it will

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,690
automatically hot update the code if you

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,070
change this these props and we have we

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,680
exposed some components like file

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,630
explorer code mirror browser preview and

00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,010
you can use these all of these

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,500
components on the left and the right

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:46,980
side is our components that we're still

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:48,690
working on so another example so this is

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,300
the code that I just shown the code that

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,840
I just shown in the example in the

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:59,640
slides is this and now with these lines

00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,980
of code you get code sandbox inside code

00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,760
sandbox you can also make this a

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:11,150
function so can also throw new what's so

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,470
instance so you have like errors and

00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,410
there are many different use cases for

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,840
this algo Leah's working currently on

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,750
something that will use this and babel

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,420
is actually also using it in their new

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,770
repple maybe I can load the Red Bull

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:33,840
oh no I'm I don't have Auto completion

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:39,020
 ok I don't know if I can do it here

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,880
yeah so this is their Red Bull their

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,830
ripple and this one is using sand back

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,570
for the translation and the advantage is

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,460
that they will get code Sam looks like

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,590
features so they will be able to have

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,940
like Babel or C editing they will have

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:57,249
custom plugins custom presets

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:59,109
those kind of things mmm and you can use

00:25:57,249 --> 00:26:01,119
it for other things as well for example

00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:02,859
I have some crazy ideas for this like

00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,440
maybe you want to have an online editor

00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:07,539
that syncs with Dropbox so you can edit

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,299
Dropbox files directly this would be a

00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:12,070
good use case for that or maybe you want

00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:13,719
to have like interactive documentation

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,820
that uses like a very custom version of

00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:16,619
the preview you can use this for that as

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,409
well

00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:24,399
so I think I'll just have time to do one

00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:26,679
more thing I think I have it here yeah

00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:30,309
so I wanted to show you the just test

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:32,679
and that is here this is a imported

00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:35,409
github repository from the real X

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,460
examples and you can see that we have

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:42,369
like a jet a test view and you can open

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:46,059
all the different files and see changes

00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:48,570
and even change stuff to be broken I

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:51,749
like to color red and you will get the

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,489
like changes and also in the code editor

00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:58,029
you can even fork this and then open a

00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:59,889
pull request to redux to say like I

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:04,349
broke your test could you merge this

00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:09,580
like I can do that not right now and

00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:12,039
open a pull request Williford create a

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,940
branch create a commit and it will now

00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:28,659
open the view for the pull request oh I

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:30,099
think I didn't open it hmm I should have

00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:33,339
opened it I think because I blocked the

00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:35,469
tap oh it's here yeah here so it will

00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:37,479
now open the boutique where's like I

00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:41,639
broke your tests and oh I even had a

00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:46,809
prettier overall everything even better

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:49,330
so that's also one thing you can do so I

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:50,889
think this is everything that I wanted

00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,409
to tell I wanted to thank the

00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:54,700
contributors we have many contributors

00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:56,139
we're completely open-source so if you

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,950
want to check out our post story it's

00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:01,329
there yeah thank you if you have any

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,690
questions just come to me

00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:07,860
I have stickers I have

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:10,129
happy thoughts and yeah thank you very

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,129
much

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:16,369
