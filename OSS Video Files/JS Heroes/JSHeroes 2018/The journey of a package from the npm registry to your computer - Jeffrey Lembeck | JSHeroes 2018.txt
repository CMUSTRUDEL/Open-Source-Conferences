Description: 
	Ever wonder what happens when you `npm install` something? Follow an odyssey across the wires as our hero client embarks on an adventure to bring you the software that you need, right when you ask for it. After this talk you'll have a better understanding of the course a package takes - helping you understand architecture that works at scale as well as being able to troubleshoot package installation problems.

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,460
I don't know how many of you have spoken

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,910
at conferences at least 23 of you have

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,039
because you know today or if this this

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,689
thing by like sometimes you follow up

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,029
really like a really good speaker and

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,700
you're like and I'm following up

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,590
all of them so right now I'm in like

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,750
super weird panic mode and that's fine

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,760
it's been a really incredible conference

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,100
and as the last person up here I get to

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:48,000
do things like everybody give a round of

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:50,129
applause for all the speakers and a

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,340
really really big one for all of the

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,239
organizers who can't possibly have done

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,500
a better job thank you seriously

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:06,840
the community here is amazing so as as

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:11,189
mentioned I am Jeff Lembeck I this is my

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,570
twitter handle screens are there and

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,710
there I'm looking everywhere like which

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,119
one should I look at down there probably

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,939
so there's my twitter handle you can uh

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,770
like holler at me there and say really

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,869
nice things about my talk while I'm

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,670
talking and then I'll get them afterward

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,420
and feel super good or you could say

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,860
like terrible things and I'll block you

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:37,799
just immediately cuz who does that also

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,259
my slides are there there's the URL for

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,780
it it has presenter notes inside of it

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,630
which I realized earlier that I leave

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,119
actual notes for myself like don't do

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,780
that you idiot and that

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,290
definitely made it in there this time so

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:58,079
good times so force more unnecessary

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:02,040
introduction I am once again from

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,079
Seattle and I'm an extremely Seattle

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,470
person like every stereotype Under the

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,600
Sun I roast my own coffee yeah

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:14,620
God and I but I don't drink Starbucks at

00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,410
all so you know more Seattle this is a

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:22,390
picture of Seattle that's incredibly

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:24,460
accurate I I took it from from my house

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,580
don't google what Seattle looks like

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,530
it's just like that so just trust me but

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,920
most importantly though that that

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,040
picture is it's not a current picture of

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,650
Seattle it's uh from from the beforetime

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,530
you see today I'm here to tell you a

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:54,840
story a story about a hero so let's

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:57,370
let's go the world is veiled in darkness

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,300
dependencies are inconsistent builds are

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,750
slow version numbers matter not the

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,430
people wait their only hope a prophecy

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,910
when dependency hell has plagued your

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,560
JavaScript project a tool will come

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,110
after a long journey some programmers

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,640
arrive each holding a pretty loaded

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:20,670
metaphor for a technical talk I give to

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,670
you

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:31,540
package quests our story begins not so

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,180
long ago when you our hero developer are

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,430
given a mission hero developer like any

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,200
of you need a complex anyway build a

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,000
great website to honor your gods of user

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,709
your gods are numerous and vengeful and

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,760
will not tolerate an experience less

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,800
than pristine your bosses the Masters of

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,260
C team are demanding that you appease

00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,700
the gods quickly so they can be granted

00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:00,040
riches in this life and the next this

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,290
task sounds grueling building each piece

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,310
of a website from nothing involves

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,630
strong magic patience and time and in a

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,730
world where each of these items is

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,489
scarce we need something to help us

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,320
something to guide us something to give

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,620
us the pieces that leave us less exposed

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,239
to the cruel monstrous insects that

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,490
anger our user gods

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,039
there is a place that is spoken of that

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,080
was used long ago after the great

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:30,770
programming war when the Dark Ages came

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,870
into place all of our help and hopes

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,000
were destroyed and speaking of this

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,699
location and the tool to get there was

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,039
forbidden but word of mouth was passed

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:44,449
on from generation to generation and you

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:48,699
our hero will search out and find our

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:51,770
land of our desires the registry the

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:53,470
only thing that we know is that tend to

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,970
the registry there's talk of a tool a

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,889
magical weapon to destroy dependency

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,889
hell that was forged by sorceress 'as of

00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,500
colorful hair this tool survived

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,210
multiple iterations and was faster and

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,770
more powerful than anybody could have

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,050
imagined this tool is called NPM NPM was

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,780
cleanly broken apart by the sorceress in

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:21,669
case the day ever came where MPM needed

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:21,669
to be built again book 1 chapter 1

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,110
according to old documentation found in

00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,360
the runes of github our magical tool

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,580
requires the help of three companions

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,990
shishi gommi the forest spirits / coach

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,000
a the master of packages and registry

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,310
client a smuggler that can give you a

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,710
special passcode to enter the registry

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,659
each of these when brought to the

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,190
sorceress is of colorful hair can be

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:54,349
forged together by the light of

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,930
JavaScript to create the NPM tool and so

00:05:54,349 --> 00:06:00,349
hero to begin we visit shishi gommi

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,300
the creator of the dependency tree the

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,380
forest spirits job is to piece together

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,900
exactly what you need from your install

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,580
it scours through your list of package

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,650
demands and also through what you

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,680
already have installed and puts together

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,930
an ideal tree a perfect structure of

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,380
your dependencies so all your needs will

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:24,380
be served it achieves this by first

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,229
reading your local package tree it does

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,219
this by combining through your node

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:33,230
modules folder then it reads your

00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,360
package lock JSON to make

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,120
sure that the tree built from your node

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,690
modules directory matches the tree from

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,400
your package lock after that it is time

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,660
to get the metadata for each missing

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,420
package at this point sheshe gommi will

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,250
call upon book coche but coach's role

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,440
within building a dependency tree is to

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,720
reach out to the registry to get

00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,020
information about each package needed to

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,270
be installed according to the documented

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:06,760
scriptures of poco che this information

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:10,430
will be delivered via Corgi doc ok so uh

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,070
I it's literally called a Corky doc

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:18,290
which naming of things internally at NPM

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:20,930
is about this consistent so because it's

00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,190
tiny but it's all I got I like go on the

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,050
internet and I start to Corgi doc

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,090
because this is bound to turn up funny

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,250
things and this is the picture I get and

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:33,140
hell yes every presentation I can ever

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:35,600
fit it into so character which is not a

00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,730
small and cute dog is represented here

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,950
but a very small piece of metadata that

00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,330
lets the tree worker know which versions

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,120
of the package are available in the

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,440
registry once this metadata is in place

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,760
the tree is normalized

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,040
sheesh egami then puts together the

00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,680
ideal tree and calculates the difference

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,270
between that and the tree that has been

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,460
put together from the package lock in

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,590
the metadata this difference is where

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,040
packages are moved removed or fetched

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,720
and installed

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,610
shishi gommi is located within the NPM

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,750
repository you go there and speak its

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:16,310
name it joins your party book 1 chapter

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,830
2 now that you have shishi gommi

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,360
you will need pou coche but coche is the

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,670
master of packages and comes equipped

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,670
with her own caching system Kakashi

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,229
kkuk ashes poco J's nearly endless pack

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,270
of fun it is a key value storage system

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,070
written in nodejs that is immensely fast

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,729
by the way no that is actually

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:44,870
named kick ash what it does best is get

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,910
you the correct data quickly it does

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,550
this with great concurrency incredible

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,820
fault tolerance support for sha-1 and

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:55,370
512 and data consistency that notices if

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,530
it's data is corrupted during

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,640
installation with the npm tool to cache

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,940
stores the package data on disk there if

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,480
the content if the content is

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,980
unavailable in the cache but coche uses

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,460
make fetch happen to fetch the package

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,150
make fetch happen is a wrapper around

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,850
node fetch

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:22,280
it's a which is a node.js implementation

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,790
of the browser's window fetch make fetch

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,130
happen tax on HTTP cache support request

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,170
pooling and several more features to

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,360
make it very easy to use and very fast

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:37,070
its caching system relies upon Kakashi

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,140
because Paco chinos that make fetch

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,180
happen uses Kakashi as its caching

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,940
system when Paco J is asked to fetch a

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,760
package it can use Kakashi directly to

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,710
get any data that it would use make

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,540
fetch happen to request before it uses

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,880
make fetch happen to get the package so

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,730
first it asks cache do you know about

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:06,890
the package I need many times

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:08,540
Kakashi's yes but when it says no the

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,950
coach I can use make fetch happen to go

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,200
out and grab the package then when make

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,120
fetch happen returns the package it can

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,890
be stored back inside of the cache for

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,380
Paco che to get next time but coche also

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,100
provides an extractor in order to unwrap

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,540
the packages that it is installing

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,640
packages come from the registry in the

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,960
form of tar ball and Paco Chi

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,490
understands how to make this into

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,650
executable JavaScript for your

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,010
consumption by unpacking the contents

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,780
and placing that code accordingly and as

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,500
mentioned before when dealing with

00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,630
sheesh egami

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,340
but bojay is capable of reaching out to

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:49,970
the registry to grab the necessary

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:53,060
metadata to understand just what

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,610
packages you need that metadata helps

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,350
shishi gommi by letting it know which

00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,510
versions the registry has of the

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,530
packages you need so it can build your

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,570
dependency tree perfectly but coche is

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,520
largely the workhorse of the npm tool

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,100
and lives in a repository on github

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,040
where you can find her you ask she

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:17,720
eagerly joins your party if you actually

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:24,290
want to find Picacho it's a under cat so

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:27,980
it's easy cat /oj should put their book

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,450
1 chapter 3 the last and final spirit

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,780
you need to build the tool is the

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,790
registry client much like many other API

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,970
clients the registry client is a wrapper

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,800
around an external API

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,780
registry client allows you to talk to

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,940
the registry for most anything revolving

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,970
around your account and management of

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,950
things you own this includes changing

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,230
ownership of packages publishing and

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,300
unpublishing packages adding and

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,810
removing members to and from your orgs

00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,530
and teams and in this case

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:03,110
authentication when you use the registry

00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:05,150
client for authentication it asks you

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,630
for your username password and email

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,190
address then it takes that to the

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,350
registry and returns with an

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,330
authentication token when you

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,870
authenticate the registry remembers your

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:21,590
token and you store it in your NPM RC

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,750
file that token will be useful when you

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:28,700
and pakoda use the tool to go and get

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,830
your package you find registry client

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,840
lurking behind a corner on github you

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,240
pass it a note saying will you join my

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:40,530
party it nods its head and follows

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,420
behind you book 1 in chapter 4

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:46,000
but coach Ashish egami and the registry

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,440
client have guided you to NPM Inc home

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,170
of the Sorceress's of brightly colored

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,760
hair they introduced themselves and walk

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,540
you and your new party members to the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,070
Installer within the realms of the

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,630
Installer they forged together the

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:05,170
spirits of your party members to be

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:06,880
called upon anytime you desire their

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,470
magic is strong and they have added to

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,240
the tool the ability to increase its

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,860
level to learn new skills and talents

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,710
along the way while simultaneously

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,370
making the quest to obtain your packages

00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,750
smoother you can tell this you can do

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,100
this by telling the tool to install

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,240
itself and as of today you will

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,250
character off as of today you'll get

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,570
version 6 but not like today right now

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:38,110
today West Coast time in the US so

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:40,990
tomorrow do it tomorrow there's new

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,470
functionality an improved update command

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:47,290
a new NPM view a new in it which can

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,720
takes initializers like you can do NPM

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,850
and yet react app and it will use create

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,400
react app to create an application and

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,310
to anything else that follows that very

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,440
specific setup npx is in there and that

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,780
was actually added in five but if you

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,700
haven't updated recently MPX is the

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,470
and you should use it all the time and

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,730
if you don't use it what are you doing

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:12,640
with your life seriously does anybody

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,480
show of hands who's used MPX in here all

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,480
the rest of you are wrong

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:31,080
CLI CLI CLI they chant the tool is yours

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:31,080
go login then install up to chapter one

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,199
with the mission to forge the CLI

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,380
complete we turn to our map to see where

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:42,410
the path forward leads all signs point

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:46,639
to the great registry registry npm JSC

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:49,240
org let us make the journey you start

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,940
your quest at the land of terminal point

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,130
first we login you pull out your CLI

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,000
tool you speak into it

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:07,180
NPM login the spirit of the registry

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:12,230
client emerges username jaylen Beck

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,750
password a very good password probably I

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,170
know that password we just like won't

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:23,240
accept anymore I think it's something

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:26,990
like the top 70% of passwords won't be

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,480
accepted and soon you won't be able to

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,120
use in either unlike the pono or the

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,860
pone all the things whatever site like

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,209
that database of like 10 gigabytes worth

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:43,670
of passwords you can't use any of them

00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:47,660
anymore email Jeff a Tempe MJS comm and

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:49,490
with that you're whisked away we ride

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,949
the road of the great network to the

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,660
first destination on this request the

00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:59,180
shopkeep she goes by the name of CDN CDN

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,399
is a class who specializes in speed she

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,069
and her sisters all with the same name

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,860
and same personality like just different

00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:10,730
locations like a nurse joy or Officer

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,920
Jenny kind of character anyway if you

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,839
get that reference that's cool spread

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,430
the globe and position themselves in

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,949
ways so you'll get to them far more

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,589
quickly and then if you were to reach

00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:24,769
out to just one part of the world she

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:25,790
handles the cash for packages and if you

00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:27,380
approach her with the name of the

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,550
package you were looking for she will do

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:34,100
her best to get it for you unbeknownst

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,139
to many CDN also provides traffic

00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,910
routing she handles all requests to the

00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:40,430
registry and will forward them along to

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,800
where they need to go how she does her

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,779
work is largely based on two things her

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,910
cash and a light routing layer written

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:50,970
in

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:52,970
VCL CDN looks at you what brings you

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:58,850
here

00:16:52,970 --> 00:17:00,540
authentication let me see

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,470
right this way

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,650
CDN guides you to a path ahead lies

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:12,440
foyer go you are whisked away to the

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:15,030
next destination book 2 chapter 2 mu

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:17,940
foyer operates as the entry point to the

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:21,270
NPM registry information about packages

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,160
users orgs teams and any modification to

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,410
these things must first go through foyer

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,520
foyer also handles the path taught

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:31,710
indication you and registry client knock

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,180
on the doors from behind the walls you

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:38,660
here what is your purpose

00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,660
I'd like to login

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:51,990
hand me your credentials one moment the

00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:57,240
guard behind the door whisks away book 2

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:59,400
chapter 3 n p.m. auth ws is who the

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,800
guard takes you to and is a gatekeeper

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,140
for proving who you are and where you

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,640
can go she is quiet and only speaks with

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,270
messengers from behind the doors of

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,670
foyer and p.m. auth WS will be handling

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,080
your authentication today authentication

00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,250
being when you can prove who you are

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,330
this is a versus authorization which is

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,960
when your check to see if you have

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,610
access to something and this is a highly

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,500
confusing thing to everybody because

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,970
people say auth and those two things

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:33,390
mean different things

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:36,090
use the whole word HTTP spec to check

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:40,140
whether you're authenticated MPM auth WS

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:42,420
will reach out to the synecdoche api the

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,940
synecdoche api is the glue that binds

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,900
together the two beholders of truth user

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:51,510
a CL 2 and payments API its API acts as

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,280
a proxy for user a CL 2 and when

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,170
requests come through the gather or

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,190
change information about payment it also

00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,600
makes a call to the payments API

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,669
there they're easy to remember in these

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,679
sweet illustrations because user a CL 2

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,629
has like the fancy plume where she keeps

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:12,090
track of everything and payments API has

00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:15,479
a super fresh coat and lots of jewels as

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,249
the MPM auth WS reaches out to login the

00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:21,509
request is proxied through synecdoche

00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:23,639
api to use her ACL to as mentioned user

00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:25,739
a CL 2 is the grand beholder of truth if

00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:28,229
any changes are made to any accounts it

00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:30,210
is written by user a CL 2 and then that

00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:33,419
information is sent elsewhere via NS q

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,859
messages any of the calls to foyer from

00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,749
the registry client that might involve

00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:40,019
changing teams organizations package

00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:42,299
permissions or users user a CL 2 and

00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:47,399
most relevant for this story logging in

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:50,129
happens and user a CL to MPN off ws is

00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:53,309
trustee client friend MP mo off user API

00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:58,729
I just want a picture of a another dog

00:19:53,309 --> 00:20:03,299
in here I can probably it gets a token

00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:04,889
it takes it off and checks it does this

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,179
like speeding through a thing here

00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:10,080
because it's totally unnecessary but I

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,090
like the dog the token is passed back

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,299
through the client sent to NPM off WS

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,029
who takes your token and saves it into

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,549
Redis the great dictionary of keys and

00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:22,259
values it will use this token in any

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,889
instance where you need to access the

00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:28,470
registry again once it has done that it

00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:30,509
passes the token back to foyer the doors

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,479
open and a hand slips out with a token

00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:37,590
attached registry client takes it walks

00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:40,320
back to you grabs your hand and you

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:43,799
transport back to CDN and then back to

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,239
terminal point your token is written in

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:51,960
your NPM RC file you are now logged in

00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:54,479
book 3 chapter 1 now that you are logged

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,489
in it's time to install you look around

00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:58,259
and are surrounded by nothing terminal

00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:01,019
point is empty with the exception of you

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,729
and the CLI your mouth starts making a

00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:08,679
sound - like it had made a thousand

00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:10,849
times before NP a minute - - yes

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,320
you're not sure where that came from or

00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:15,499
where you'd heard it if you've ever

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,339
heard it but there it was and now in

00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:22,369
front of you is a package.json file you

00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:27,979
look at the CLI once again and say MPM

00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:30,739
install Express shishi gommi arrives and

00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:33,529
looks around seeing no node modules

00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,820
folder no package lock JSON she she got

00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:38,899
me whistles and Paco che arrives

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,119
carrying to cash over her shoulder or in

00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:46,039
her hand like this

00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:48,409
they speak quietly they put together the

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,950
address but coche grabs your hand and

00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:54,529
you disappear again back to the CDN

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:58,549
chapter two once again you walk up to

00:21:54,529 --> 00:22:02,839
the shopkeeper coche speaks check my

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:07,070
accept header I see you're here for the

00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:11,809
Corgi Amman unscoped package excellent

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:14,119
go along you remember from before that a

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,249
Corgi is a metadata file for the package

00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,959
requested it's significantly smaller

00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:20,629
than your standard JSON representation

00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:22,609
of the package and it includes disk tags

00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:24,859
version numbers in each versions

00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:27,649
dependencies since the package is

00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:29,749
unscoped it is a public package so

00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,119
there's known security torii about all

00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:34,759
public packages are readable by

00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:38,450
everybody CDN sends you to a specific

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,149
address in the Cave of Wonders you

00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,489
arrive at the Cave of Wonders and s3 or

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:45,529
Google Cloud storage instance that is

00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:49,059
the home of packages and their

00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:52,099
information served right from the disk

00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:55,759
who disturbs myself no hello what do you

00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:59,109
need we're here for the Corgi of this

00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:05,749
unscoped package here is the address

00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:08,079
very well go right along you get your

00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,079
Corgi

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:17,700
and take it back to CDN who then cashes

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,299
it for quicker retrieval the next time

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,640
it's needed

00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:24,299
after that you head back to terminal

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,130
point once arriving you and put coach a

00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,500
hand over the Corgi dock - sheesh egami

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,760
who reads it and then sends the two of

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,070
you back to the Corgi for each

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,740
dependency this occurs until all the

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,090
Corgi docks are retrieved

00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,070
once shisha gommi has all the docs

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:43,830
necessary it produces a dependency tree

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:45,270
you've gained a dependency tree now that

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,059
you have your dependency tree the tool

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,010
begins glowing again it calls upon poco

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,960
che to get the packages poco che sees

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,510
the versions and packages needed and

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,960
uses those to create new routes to

00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:01,380
request this time it's tgz files tar

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,250
balls but coche checks inside of her bag

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,140
hmm

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,539
it's empty she pulls out make fetch

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:10,370
happen says a few words grabs your hand

00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:15,330
and once again you're on the road to CDN

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:19,110
tar balls our CDN specialty exciting but

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:25,559
coche walks up to CDN it says here that

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:29,520
I need to reach this address oh let me

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:35,700
see if this is in my cache it is here

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,770
you are but thanks and you're on your

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,630
way back

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,399
see DNS caching system stores cashable

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,710
tar balls at its points across the globe

00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:45,510
that means that public packages have

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,149
been downloaded by other users aren't

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,110
that have been downloaded by other users

00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:51,149
can be saved after they've been

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,929
retrieved from the package servers this

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:56,820
makes for an extremely quick experience

00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:58,740
but coaches make fetch again stores the

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:05,760
package away for you and Kakashi just in

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:08,720
case you need it again side note if you

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,210
use npm install' - just prefer offline

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,990
you can just hit every time with no

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:18,330
network hit a cache first and if you've

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,820
installed it in any package it

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,090
automatically that's where you end up

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,860
downloading from so you can

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,510
do it with no network hit so if you've

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,880
installed for a project before and

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,549
nobody's added any new stuff and maybe

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,260
that directory got wiped out prefer

00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:38,320
offline well but you could do it on a

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:42,429
plane like even a United one their

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:46,480
Internet's terrible sorry if you work on

00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:50,529
United stuff on to the next package

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:55,750
array flat inversion 1.1.1 and back to

00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:58,510
CDN you go on the way you ESPO coche do

00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,700
you really make one trip at a time poco

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,529
che laughs oh dear developer this is no

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,500
js' and some guys just on a stage

00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:07,720
teaching people about how this works

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,399
it's of course as a sink we're walking

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:18,279
through this see really for learning

00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:21,640
benefits you nod it says here that I

00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,200
need to reach this address oh this is

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,110
certainly a nun scoped package so it's

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,120
public but it isn't in my cache let me

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:31,120
send you along to the Cave of Wonders to

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:38,890
that specific file you arrived at the

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:42,399
cave who disturbs marshal we're here for

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:47,049
this specific unscoped package very well

00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:50,559
go right along you grabbed the package

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:52,480
and head back to CDN who asks if she can

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,730
make a copy in case someone else wants

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,490
this later then you head back to

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,830
terminal point this continues through

00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,899
all of these public packages but coach

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,080
hxk cache does not have the necessary

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:07,000
package heads to CDN she either has the

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,770
package or not if not she sent you to

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,120
the closest package server and makes

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:13,840
sure to cache the package on your way

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,429
back once each of the packages has been

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,820
downloaded the kocha begins the

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:20,590
extraction the tar balls are untargeted

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,559
to the node modules directory to match

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:26,320
the tree the tool glows again and begins

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:28,240
to run its lifestyle script life cycle

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,910
script lifestyle script is a totally

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,910
different thing npm install fashions

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:38,250
you hear a song sing the words

00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:43,110
pre-install build install post install

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:45,120
finalize refresh package.json your

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,890
package.json has changed all your files

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,809
are properly placed in built and they

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:52,770
are now requiring your project and you

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:57,270
can use them the in the end look for

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:59,430
chapter 1 I'm coming up way over this

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,110
time sorry all things are peaceful again

00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,370
you can move quickly and build your web

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,530
application now that you have a

00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,420
framework in place but you need another

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,059
package and this time it's a private one

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,330
for your org you pull out your trusty

00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:14,970
CLI and speak into it NPM install my

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,980
private package sheesh egami arises

00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,990
again and calls upon poco che for you to

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,950
get the Corgi for your scoped package

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,150
you and coach a head off to the CDN CDN

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,040
asks what you're here for

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,790
and notices that your Corgi doc request

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,770
is for a scoped package before you can

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,150
say anything else she opens the door and

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:36,510
sends you along to the next step on your

00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:42,050
quest idea if I master of all things off

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:44,700
I mean all both ones look for chapter 2

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,710
idea fie the master of awe and protector

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,050
of the cave carries the keys to your

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,309
journey to package server she will make

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,020
sure that you are who you say you are

00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,090
and that you are capable of viewing that

00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,550
package then she will tell CDN if you

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,590
are worthy she asks you for your

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,690
credentials mainly the authentication

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:07,320
headers that CDN makes sure you have and

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:09,570
sends you to die of authen in the the

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,150
script that we had run inside the CDN

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,800
code will wipe out the headers that you

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,110
try to send in case you're all hackery

00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:19,010
and then replace with headers that are

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,010
special and local

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:25,640
the eyes true name is ID and identify

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,630
credentials mainly the authentication

00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,320
headers that CDN makes sure you have and

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:37,200
sends you to the eye of often the eyes

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,480
true name is identify I tried to get it

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,730
to be named eye of authen and nobody was

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,720
down with that MPM which I find very

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:47,940
unfair that name is sick and you come to

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,590
it from ID Atif eye it once the exact

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,929
request you came with and it examines

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,510
your headers in particular it cares for

00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:58,530
your authentic after your authorization

00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:00,270
cookie and CDN client IP headers since

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,860
we were unable to bring a session cookie

00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,920
from which to feed the eye it will have

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,060
to look into our authorization header an

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,590
authorization header includes the saints

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,170
or includes the scheme and the

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,240
credentials being used for the eye the

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,920
scheme is bearer and the credentials are

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,230
your authentication token bestowed upon

00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,760
you when you logged in if your

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,300
credentials match the records that

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,490
identify keeps it it gives you with the

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,960
sigil of your house I'm sure let's go

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,340
with that you will no longer be

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,090
questioned and you will be sent along

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,250
your way now how does it check remember

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,410
logging in when your token was created

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,700
it was stored in a Redis instance may my

00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:39,030
voice is going so now I'm just like back

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,350
to speaking normally it was stored in a

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,480
Redis instance that is now being

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,310
referenced by identify as long as that

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,230
token remains in Redis it is valid to

00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,990
reference and can be used to get through

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,110
identify the tokens that you've used are

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,090
available there

we will never deploy or display your

00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,750
entire tokens also I have way too many

00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,750
tokens and probably should delete some

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,370
of those that is a security hazard now

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:04,410
that your token has been retrieved it is

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,810
