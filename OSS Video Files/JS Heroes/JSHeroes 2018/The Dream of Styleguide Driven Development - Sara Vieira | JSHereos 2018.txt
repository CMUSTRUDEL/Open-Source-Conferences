Title: The Dream of Styleguide Driven Development - Sara Vieira | JSHereos 2018
Publication date: 2018-05-04
Playlist: JSHeroes 2018
Description: 
	You have heard of all types of driven development but react emerged a new type, styleguide driven development became a reality with components. This type of development focuses on Developer/Designer collaboration and on assertive components. With the use of React, CSS-in-JS, Flow and Snapshot testing we were able to almost remove style regressions. In this talk you get a glimpse of you can start styleguide driven development and how you can sell this dream to your project managers.

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,299

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,430
apologize I woke up around 30 minutes

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:24,840
ago let's make this exciting yay

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:30,240

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,009
make me wake up thank you I just want to

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,809
say first that I'm truly in love with

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,329
Romania this is exactly the same as

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,030
Portugal like all the quirks are still

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,309
here like everyone just parks wherever

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,629
like the default color of cars is just

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,239
dirty and it's it's madness and chaos in

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,660
the streets and I love it I feed on

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,730
chaos I am like a horrible driver

00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:01,530
yell at everyone but I love driving and

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:03,030
this town is perfect what not too much

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,540
like I went to Milan that was too much

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,409
chaos Jesus

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:11,939
okay so story time yay so this is a

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,659
story of all I fell in love with style

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,869
guides and basically what happened is I

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,759
used to work in a company where like we

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,350
were like 40 people in one project and

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,110
no one liked CSS so just before I found

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,060
out that literally no one likes CSS so

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,920
can somebody raise their hands of who

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,759
like CSS but not a love-hate

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,049
relationship just a love relationship

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,909
can you please come work for my light

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,790
lab by my old company because we

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,040
need some of those and like no one likes

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,890
CSS I think I was hired mainly because I

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,689
only I liked CSS so was the CSS matte

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,600
magician at that company my magician I

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,610
mean I made flecks things it's not like

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,110
a fancy thing I just made flecks things

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,110
work and they were like oh my god how

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,579
did you do this two lines of code okay

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,130
so this is the story of I fell in love

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,909
with style guides and like we had a lot

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,189
of legacy CSS and a lot is mainly it's a

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,450
lot like the moment you wrote CSS about

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,160
a week later it was legacy like because

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,440
the thing is like it was so like drill

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,770
down and like there was there for so

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,660
long

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,730
that it like when you wrote it just like

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,130
you could you can you can help it

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,410
and like in reality it was legacy less

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,360
which you think would be better because

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,980
you I like variables and stuff but like

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,910
in reality all he did is certain like

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,180
turn this into this and I was in which

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:37,590
was slightly better but now really is I

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,210
just made the files a lot bigger okay in

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,040
order to get it like a full grasp of the

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,810
rest of the part you need to understand

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,230
our oh okay

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,970
our specificity works in CSS so for

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,890
example if you have one element that's

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,230
worth one point it's actually worth

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,390
about like zero point two but woke up 20

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,890
minutes ago math fell math in high

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,650
school we're not doing that

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,480
and a class is worth 10 points an ID is

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,060
worth 100 any line style is worth a

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,750
thousand I don't know who came up with

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,610
this but in order to override an ID with

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,550
a class you have to use eleven classes

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,250
this is why people tell you not to use

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,540
IDs if you ever get this question at an

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,360
interview because I used to do this

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,470
question it's that it's that people just

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,850
usually say that's like because you can

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,440
only have one ID and it's like no that's

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,470
fine the problem is that it's gonna be

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,870
there forever you can never go away but

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,270
the thing is important overrides all of

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,430
this and we had a problem with

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:36,420
importance it's telling about my problem

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,680
with importance okay so if important

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,510
overrides all of this how do you

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
override this like this was a thing that

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,040
was a problem so we had like a bundle s

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,930
where all the buttons got their stuff

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,360
and the button that lasts at an

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,850
important in it and like but bottom of

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,550
the pile at an important so how do you

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,959
override that important well I mean are

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,640
you override it without like inline

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,020
Styles because every time you use inline

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,030
Styles a kid dies okay I don't know

00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,340
about you but I got some feelings like

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,340
three different types of feelings only

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,260
two of them are anger so don't kill

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,760
kittens I have one okay they're

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,220
adorable you override it with a tag

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,799
because like you may think no no one

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,209
does I've done this so many times so

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,550
many times so basically you were like

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,390
all the way down in the specificity will

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,210
and you're like you know what I'm gonna

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,039
overwrite this with a body tag there

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,979
a ton of body tags like in that in that

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,330
code so we had an important problem and

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,639
we had literally a problem with

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,180
important and after a while we started

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,680
using post CSS instead of using less and

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,130
that's when I created a plugin for post

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,590
CSS and what this plug-in does is that

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,479
this is in Portuguese but basically what

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,830
this plug-in does is that if you're

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,169
right important it does absolutely

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:57,180
nothing it's just no no no no no the

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,389
best part is coming way you got to write

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,009
curse words for it to do important stuff

00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,440
so basically this was only in Portuguese

00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,570
by the time that I made it so it forced

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,130
everyone to put like curse Portuguese

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,259
curse words in the code base and they

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,840
started feeling bad so they stopped

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:18,210
using importance and it was great and it

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,740
actually words like people stopped using

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,080
importance basically because they felt

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,050
ashamed of using importance after a

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,580
while like I moved into style components

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,340
and I also made a babble plug-in that

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,630
does exactly the same thing but just for

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,550
like for the sake of it okay so this is

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,580
my story of how i started using style

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,610
guides after this after this whole thing

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,349
am i using this plugin for a little for

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,509
a very long this was lasted for like two

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,800
months I had to like manually override

00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,810
all the importance with curse words in

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,099
Portuguese as well and like ship it to

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,930
master so that it wouldn't be like a

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:56,039
pull request because that would have

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,860
been awkward and after all of

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,330
this we we were this was an angular 1

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,070
app you're like yeah that makes it

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,599
better I know right so there's a bunch

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,469
of timeouts and a bunch of importance

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:09,360
and we were at a time you were like you

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:13,289
know we should use use reacts because

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,270
like it's like 2016 or something and we

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,009
should use react and then when you start

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,690
using react I was like no we're making a

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,409
style guide and they're like you don't

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,780
know what the that is

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,250
yeah I do I search it on the internet I

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,570
saw I saw I talked about two days ago

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,099
we're making a style guide because I

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,960
can't live like this anymore okay

00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,659
I want to become an uber driver by this

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,580
point and they were like okay okay say

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,080
you mean you make your own style guide

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,139
or like no one's gonna use it everyone

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,659
 used it okay so my name is Sarah

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,520
and full-stack too and the other Sarah

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:43,669
I'm

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,020
stock developer at yld I am Nikita FTW

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,449
two K's on Twitter because the first one

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,599
was taken by the TV show I really like

00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:54,800
football and I really like horror movies

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:56,479
I'm from Portugal like Alex said and if

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,789
you don't quite remember us we won the

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:07,280
euro and no one knows how the that

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:10,039
happens I don't know the that

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,110
happened either but it's like one of

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,550
those like magical moments where like

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,280
everything comes together and now we're

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,919
the new Greece where no one knows but

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,199
okay so let's actually do a talk about

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,120
stuff that's important and I like the

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,849
shame of my country so

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,610
so I'll get driven development yay okay

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,220
so what I'm gonna go over is what it is

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,380
how you shouldn't how you can implement

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,169
it some of these parts will be react

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,960
specific but there are versions of it

00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:41,949
for angular and view I tend to just use

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,569
react and what you should do it

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,849
okay so what is style guy driven

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,979
development it's basically just a change

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,780
in perspective like every single person

00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,969
in here can do it it's just a basically

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,259
a change in perspective because imagine

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:57,110
that you get something like this

00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,029
and what are you gonna do is basically

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,690
like start start hacking away in your

00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:06,169
JSX or your view files or your angular

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,210
template files and that isn't that is

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,500
not how designers think for example they

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,389
might be like we need to think a little

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,029
bit more like designers designers break

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,580
everything into building blocks and they

00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:19,909
don't do this because they want to be

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,740
smarter than you know also maybe not

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,289
sure how many designers have we met like

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,400
a third of them maybe do that but they

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,690
do this because it's really more

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,819
maintainable for them and they're

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,259
actually trying to help us they're

00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:31,520
actually trying to say like these are

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,510
the blocks you should maybe make these

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,190
blogs but they don't wanna be dicks

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,669
about it so they just make a different

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,349
sketch file and that's about it and so

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:41,240
the first thing that you're gonna do is

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:44,200
start hacking away in your JSX

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,250
or your viewed files or the web packs or

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,480
actually now with web pack for you don't

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,990
have to back away that much but you know

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,550
what I mean

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,580
hashtag remember one yeah first

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,890
I remember grunt

00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,990
that was pain and what happens is like

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,590
you make that page okay cool it looks

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,880
dope

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,410
you're gonna go to all your friends and

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,350
they'll be proud of you because all your

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,270
friends are nerds I guess and um and

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,470
it's gonna look dope but the thing is

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,780
like somebody's gonna give you another

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,510
page and then your life Fox and I gotta

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,400
copy all the stuff on the other page and

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,160
custom CSS is the death of a developer

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,320
like I know this is very like deep but I

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,400
woke up literally thirty minutes ago so

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,890
excuse me and custom CSS is the death of

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,080
a developer the idea of CSS in my mind

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,120
as someone who actually likes CSS is

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,550
that you should write it once and you

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,070
should never touch it again that

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,660
is the idea so is Opera Mini the death

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,350
of a developer but that's like a talk

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,720
for another day

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:50,010
os who here has worked with Opera Mini

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:52,710
oh poor Matthias your browser is better

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,750
okay so Opera Mini is this thing for

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:58,710
when you have you pay a lot of money for

00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,690
mobile data and it's just so bad it's

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,790
like incredibly bad because it doesn't

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,010
support anything in CSS basically except

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,050
flexbox and so if you want to make water

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:11,850
radius you got to go all $19.99 on that

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,650
 and put images on it so it

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,670
can't is supposed to save you data but

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,900
then if you eventually just start

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,580
downloading a whole bunch of stuff that

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,540
you could actually do it CSS but it

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,550
doesn't support it okay so what is the

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,800
idea that I'm trying to convey very

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,540
fancy worry right now okay so you have

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,300
that design that I just showed you and

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,070
the idea is that you pick up that design

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,280
and you try to split it into components

00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,530
you try to like abstract your incredible

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,870
need of creating react reviewer angular

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,300
stuff and you're like no no I got a

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,370
chill okay I got a chill and I gotta

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,410
like think about this in a component way

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,360
because there's gonna be more pages like

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,570
if you make a website that's just one

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,940
page for the rest of his life I love you

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,580
I know you're so lucky

00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,240
usually now and so divide that thing

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,370
into components and there we go

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,560
so basically get typography get buttons

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,990
get to get the icons get the cards get

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,650
everything

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:12,740
make components out of it so as a recap

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,210
of how it what it is I was like Stargate

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,130
Riven development is a mentality it's

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,010
not a skill like everyone can do this

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,290
it's not it's not hard at all I failed

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,100
math twice in high school it's not hard

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,410
so it's more of like trying to escape

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,590
the thing that we've always had of being

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,230
of getting like a sketch file or like a

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:36,260
PSD does anyone still use Photoshop for

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,130
this type of stuff no ok good sketch

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:43,490
file or figma file or whatever it is and

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:46,280
not let not start like writing code all

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:49,400
like just start writing code because

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,650
that's why we like but no like think

00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,570
about it from somehow of a designer

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:56,660
perspective and try it and divide it

00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:00,230
into little building blocks exactly what

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,720
I just said yes so think of your website

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,940
as something from a design standpoint

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,800
and not just ones and zeros because

00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,150
that's how we think of of stuff but

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,380
that's not how a designer thinks of

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,750
stuff and in order for us to actually

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,940
understand each other we need to kind of

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,650
speak the same language and we can't

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,870
teach all designers to code and neither

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,790
I think we should and we can't teach all

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,310
front-end developers to design catch

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,470
that would be horrible

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,570
tell me here's not a bootstrap web all

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,250
over again remember that was like five

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,580
years ago every web site was bootstrap

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,930
and think of your website from a

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,970
designer standpoint think of your

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:39,620
website as blocks okay so now you know

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,110
what it is and you're probably like I

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,630
don't care but the thing has to continue

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,270
cuz I got to stay here for 40 minutes

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,940
I'm so sorry so tools that you can use

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,970
to actually make this happen these one

00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,760
of them is react specific the other one

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,090
has things for angular and view I think

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,380
no I think angle and I'm sure of you so

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,350
first one that I'm going to talk about

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,280
is reacts tightest I have stickers of

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,710
reactions I'll guide us

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,540
I have stickers of both so as long

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,130
whatever you use just do this please

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,130
like you can make you happy I promise

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,120
and since there were no reactions I'll

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,970
guide as boilerplates

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,160
on the internet I created a simple style

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,920
guide just boilerplate this will I will

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,980
share all

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,560
links like on Twitter and everything so

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,690
you get clone this and you CD into its

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,959
delete the get stuff and just yarn

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:34,740
started or NPM or sorry Jeff yarn

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,029
started Jeff works for NPM I'm not even

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,930
sure he's here and you get something

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:42,149
like this which is this okay so what do

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,550
you get from the start is something that

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,699
you're like that's not pretty chill okay

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,380
sure and you get something so imagine

00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,910
this is a basic button you get the code

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,540
here and you can actually change the

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,709
code like long and it changes it that

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,899
low me yeah that's what I think about

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,720
every day when I wake up actually thank

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:02,940
you computer and you can change the code

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,230
and you can even you can what if this

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,459
does is that it reads markdown files so

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,410
you know the readme files that you

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,570
usually have on your open-source project

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,329
but no one reads them react style guy

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,149
just reach them like a good human I love

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,709
it so you have a component and then you

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,480
have a readme that MD file which

00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,779
automatically imports that component and

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,310
you can write to JSX in it and you will

00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,120
render the component that is exported

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:33,540
default on your on your JS file which is

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,540
great and this is about what you get but

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,399
the thing about the thing about reacts

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,339
al-qaida's is that react cell guidance

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,620
is completely customizable like it's

00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,660
built on top of reactor and the thing is

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,850
like e gives you all of the tools that

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,459
you need to customize it for example at

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,600
the moment i yld wear a consultancy and

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:55,890
at this moment I am working for giant

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,040
cloud computing thing and we made them a

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:01,170
style guide and it looks like this which

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,740
looks absolutely nothing like what you

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,290
saw

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,399
so if you go like here to the buttons I

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,260
don't know what I'm looking for they're

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,089
like computers here and you get like

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,880
tabs and you get like the disable button

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,970
and then the code and secondary button

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,410
and like tables stuff like that and it's

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,510
completely different from what I just

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,069
showed you because the thing about react

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,029
shall guide us is that it allows you to

00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,699
change completely

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,769
everything about the actual style guide

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:32,069
you're not forced to use that little

00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:35,790
thing if you don't like it okay so how

00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:37,500
do you use it so imagine now you have an

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,959
app you have a cell guide that config

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,329
because what is life without a config

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,519
file and then you have like pumpkins are

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:46,350
chasing bobble Arceus lint because you

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,449
should always lint all the things and

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,800
you have in the you have a source

00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:52,620
components and there's a component

00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,319
called button it has an index that is a

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,350
bun - yes and a bun that CSS all this

00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:02,279
index that Jas does is like so imagine

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,839
that you have a folder called form if

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,029
you don't create an index - oh yes which

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,980
is gonna import stuff from like slash

00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:11,130
foreign / input instead of this is just

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,050
the imports from form and you export it

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,110
out a form like not as a default but as

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,790
a normal export and the stomach like

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,459
that config is basically like a very

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,899
small chunk of a web pack and fake so

00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,640
first thing that you do is that you tell

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,040
it where your components are this says

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,630
like it's in source / components /

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,050
anything whatever the you want and

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,850
anything from A to Z that ends in J s

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,890
default example is a thing that they do

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,769
in dev mode which is like if you forget

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,199
to put an example they will tell you

00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:42,449
they're gonna be like yo you're missing

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,430
something it won't show up in production

00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:45,600
so it's more of a reminder for you to

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,390
add examples of stuff and actually

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
document your stuff next part is the

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,779
title this one is pretty

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,579
self-explanatory then you got a

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,189
and figure like oh no it's just two

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,360
rules okay it's fine so your test for

00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,370
Jaso JSX

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,410
and you just use the babel order critter

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,559
babel RC and school node modules by

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,449
default and then you load CSS I honestly

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,839
now use CSS and J's

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,909
but that doesn't mean a loader so so you

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,380
test for CSS you give it to the CSS

00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:15,240
loader and then to the style order just

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,439
slaps it on your page because web pack

00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,329
works the other way around

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,790
as in like the normal way of thinking

00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,010
and then you have a button that yes this

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,799
is where you make all your things that

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,209
Curnow great I guess so you import like

00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,040
all the things that you need so prop

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,409
types the button that CSS and the react

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,760
and you create a button so you can find

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,590
your components that it gets all of

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,600
these props and you create some styles

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,940
and then literally you just return the

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,559
component this is what you usually do

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,960
like you have to change nothing about

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,279
your approach but

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,679
I would recommend you to use something

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,169
like the prop types because you get that

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,809
in the documentation so if I if I come

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,820
here and there's a thing called props

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,130
and methods which will tell you all the

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,950
prop types that this this actually gets

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,779
so this is the type this is F it's

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,940
required or the default and it also

00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,510
gives you a description and this is all

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,880
read from from this from the prop types

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,490
it also understands flow and type script

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,110
so you can see that it has a description

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,820
here and the color is a prop type of

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,559
string it can also do like prop types

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,020
one of and you will show up in there

00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,740
which is very useful also default props

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:24,380
and that's about it then in the readme

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,840
it automatically imports that index and

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,720
you can just use your button so use a

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,700
button and you can render with props

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,500
that you can change in the client side

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,149
or your designers can change in the

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,710
client side or your QA team can change

00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:39,110
in the client side and then send it take

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,539
it back that's fun you can also disable

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,010
the editor and this is like one of those

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,360
things that you're like why would I want

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,059
to do this maybe because you have pages

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,250
like this which makes no sense for you

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,500
to have an editor here like this is

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,520
still a page in reaction al Qaida's but

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,929
it doesn't make sense for you to like be

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,950
editing this stuff because this is just

00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:00,799
text so disable the editor and you can

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,720
also render examples as static text so

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,659
you're just right for example j/s or

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,480
HTML or CSS static and it will render

00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:10,460
normal text what did you invent egde of

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,370
this one like it can be used to react

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,919
and I'm a really pretty I really really

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,679
like pre actor some reason and it can be

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,409
used to react the design is completely

00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,320
customizable and this is what I usually

00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:26,179
say about this reactional guidance is

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,789
that if you want to share this with the

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:31,490
world you can do whatever you want the

00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:33,350
world is your oyster like you know you

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,419
can change the design completely and

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,120
it's still usable and that is a very

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:39,679
good thing and it has a live editor

00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,240
which is very good like you can change

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,580
stuff without any plugins or anything it

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,860
just comes built-in and your component

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,120
definition is in markdown and this means

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:53,870
that you get automatic documentation

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,460
that's so good story book Jas so story

00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:00,620
book actually exists

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,850
for view and reacts yeah you and react I

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,490
think they're making an angular version

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,360
as well so as well there's a simple

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,590
boilerplate

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,510
I will share all of this I was thinking

00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,740
the same thing yarn knits and yarn start

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,000
it and and you get something like just

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,220
close the other tabs otherwise I'm gonna

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,740
get lost and you get something like this

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,630
this is the default thing that you get

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,059
with a storybook but you may think like

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,700
it doesn't look that amazing because

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:29,000
storybook relies a lot on add-ons there

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,370
are add-ons for everything there's an

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,690
add-on for figma and that API has been

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,470
out for like three weeks

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,090
this team is dope let you have add-ons

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,840
for everything you have add-ons for

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,309
figma for sketch for graphic UL anything

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,529
you could ever want to need in life you

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,730
have add-ons for it and you're the first

00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,080
item that you should install is

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,230
basically an action logger that just

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,909
tells your stuff and you can that this

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,730
is basically the example that you get

00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:59,659
from the default and now let me come

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,210
here yeah so this has a slightly

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,289
different structure so have an app and

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,789
you have the components the components

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,559
are exactly the same except that it

00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,210
doesn't have a readme file and then you

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,520
have a dot storybook where you put your

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,710
storybook configuration and then you

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,390
have your stories the that out is the

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,779
builds you can rename it to whatever you

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,480
want

00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:20,750
then bundage is is exactly the same

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,240
thing so we imported you define it and

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,240
you export it and define prop types and

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,740
that's about it and the way that story

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,100
book works is that every single

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,039
component is a story and that's why it's

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:38,570
called storybook I guess I'm not sure

00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm pretty sure so to create stories you

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,980
got to go on stories and create one with

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,460
the name of your urine of your component

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,169
so you imports reacts and or view or

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,210
whatever you use for creating this and

00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:50,870
you import stories up from storybooks

00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,880
that react

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,470
there's that's why it's storybook that

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
reactions that have been just storybook

00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,669
it's there's also storybook slash view

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,000
and you import action from the add-on

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:04,669
actions and you import your button and

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,559
basically like you define the name of

00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:07,880
the story so stories off button you can

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,179
rename it to whatever you want like

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,419
chicken shortage whatever you

00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,789
and this will this is basically like a

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:17,129
described statement in jest and this is

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:18,779
like this is all the things that belong

00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:22,019
to the button that's about it

00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:25,529
and then we got your it's so you add a

00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:27,149
story that has with text and basically

00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:29,330
it runs a function that returns that

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:32,129
button and on click you call this action

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,479
you call this action that we imported

00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,700
right here because this is an add-on

00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:38,609
that's just like a logger for clicking

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,320
events and everything and that's about

00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,119
it so you can render with other things

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,549
and it's a very easy way of

00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,049
understanding as well so nothing the

00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,570
thing about this one is that nothing is

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:50,070
magical like for something to be able to

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,559
be seen in your storybook you really

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,960
have to think about it and it has to be

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
like you have to create the stories for

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,440
it

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,399
so the config is actually super simple

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,049
so you import configure from SOI book I

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:06,479
react you load the stories and you

00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,089
require some stories you have to require

00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,859
every single story that you have and or

00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,839
you can create an index that is that

00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:15,179
just exports all of them and you can

00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:18,419
figure load stories and attach it to the

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:19,619
model that configuration exactly good

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,529
thing about this that you can be used

00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:24,269
with you I honestly like few because I

00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,820
think I see viewers like the little

00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:29,549
kitten of web frameworks it's so

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,499
adorable like it's a it's a it's a

00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:33,960
kitten and I like it like I use I use it

00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:37,320
a lot for like personal stuff it has a

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,929
lot of add-ons like this this has a link

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,279
to the add-ons page it has a lot of

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:44,580
add-ons that you can use including

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,710
graphic UL everything it has automatic

00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,019
testing it has automatic accessibility

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,059
testing which is very very good that you

00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:52,769
should never forget it has like a nobs

00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,869
plug-in which allows you to change props

00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:57,149
and everything like that it has an

00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:58,710
integrated console like you saw like you

00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,289
saw here because you can I just I just

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,519
blogged something random but you can log

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,289
whatever you want actually this one is

00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,080
not logging but this one you can log

00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:10,080
whatever you want and you component

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,859
definition is in plain JSX so i was like

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,389
this is a good thing

00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,219
also for markdown because i'm like if

00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:16,889
you don't give me a configuration file i

00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:21,769
am fine just like i have bad dreams with

00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:21,769
grunts still ashtag remember grunt and

00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,179
yep yeah so now you're like okay this

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,679
sounds pretty amazing but how do i

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,049
integrate this in a project and in an

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,030
actual team that has developers and

00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:35,730
designers and other human beings and

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:38,700
stuff like that so for developers like

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,410
you can like create a style guy like

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,890
user on Reaper in a separate folder and

00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:46,620
that's like the 1990 99 way of doing

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,600
things but it kind of works I guess you

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,370
can create an NPM package and with

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,049
versioning and keep updating that but

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,549
the thing about this problem that I saw

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,210
that this was the first approach that we

00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:59,549
did was that you keep breaking it and

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,309
it's not fun like keep upgrading the

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,990
stuff so it starts being a problem

00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,820
because on the beginning you don't have

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,679
a pretty thing like you have this weird

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,260
a style guide and you have to keep

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,299
changing stuff and you can use learn

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,630
that to create a mono repo who here

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,250
knows what learn is okay so learner is

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,659
basically a tool by Facebook as we use

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,659
everything that Facebook makes except

00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,390
their own website because it's creepy

00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,520
okay so Laura is a tool paid by a by a

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:31,020
the amazing Facebook developers and what

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,289
it does is you shouldn't multiple NPM

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,520
packages in the same repository and just

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:37,919
in different folders but they have

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
independent NPM versions they are

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,220
completely independent of each other

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,750
they can run you can just like yarn

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,789
started in the start and it just fronts

00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,860
all of them in parallel it's it's a

00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:49,169
pretty good thing we've been using this

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,210
and the way that you can use it you can

00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:54,510
you can actually like publish it to NPM

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,799
or by default if you like symlink it it

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,179
will just use the one that's there

00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,549
instead of using the one that's on NPM

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,500
so when you feel comfortable you release

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,289
a new version but you can always use the

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,200
latest version so the broken one for

00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:10,020
designers well we can have all your

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,640
design folders in Dropbox that's the way

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,890
and I have all of them have the

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,320
underscore final in the end of it and

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,169
you never really know is it is it final

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,730
14 or final 50 I honestly like imagine

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,090
being a designer for a week and you

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:26,039
don't have get why we make fun of this

00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,570
but I imagine not having good that

00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,360
that's that I just suck

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,830
there is a tool for sketch if your

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,990
designer team uses sketch that's called

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:37,150
cactus which is basically like a get

00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:40,690
it has diffing and everything for sketch

00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,250
which is very good and use figma so I'm

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,620
not sponsored by figment neither do I

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,440
work for them in any particular way but

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,450
figma is dope like figma is basically

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,890
like a tiny version of sketch in the

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,790
browser so that means that it works

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,260
everywhere so sketch only works on Macs

00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,970
so you have to like export it to like

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:01,390
Zeppelin or something to be able to work

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:04,179
on Windows figma is web-based and it's

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,830
written on reacts I think and it offers

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:07,150
really cool things like real-time

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,370
collaboration is a really cool thing you

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:11,380
can have comments you have version

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,020
history for designers which for us is

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,660
just like jacket you don't understand

00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,429
the pain of them and it's browser-based

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,730
it's very good it has a desktop app

00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:23,350
which is okay and like it works on

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,820
everything it literally works on

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,620
everything as integrations with slack it

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,120
has integrations with framer if you

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,440
don't know a framer is it's basically a

00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,510
tool for creating like oh like mock-ups

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,880
for designers to create but it's like

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,110
it's it's really cool my designer in my

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,350
old company used it you learn

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,390
CoffeeScript as it's written on

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,740
CoffeeScript it has like a presentation

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,570
mode that allows you to make like

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,910
animations from side to side and stuff

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,030
like that and it's like email and slack

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:55,630
notifications do not turn them on and

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:57,580
freedom has an API and since when

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,190
something release an API the world of

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,650
developers just goes like yes i'ma do it

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,950
 with it so awesome stuff came out

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:09,220
of the figma api so this is a figment to

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,380
PDF export and basically you get all

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,140
your figma files and you just put them

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:16,450
in here and it gives you a PDF and you

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,520
can send your PDF to whatever you want

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,970
and they will get an idea of what you're

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,150
doing

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,490
this is figma Jas which is a wrapper

00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,590
around the fig may pie it's like an SDK

00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,020
around the figma api so that you can get

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,030
all the stuff from it this is something

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,920
that I've done with Bernardo it's figma

00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,890
graphic you all it's physically a graft

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,530
URL connector to the fig Magius and to

00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,630
the figma api because i don't I I

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,720
started using graph QL about a year and

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,550
a half ago and I can't go back it's

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,169
honestly like I either go all jason

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,790
files or graft UL if there's something

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,550
in between i cryo bin

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,970
like I use it but I just like she was so

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:58,060
much easier with Apollo and what about

00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:01,930
reacts components well yours truly has a

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:05,440
lot of free time so this is something

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:07,240
that is built on react and comes from

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,370
frequent figma so this is the figma file

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:15,220
that I used and this is the react app it

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,560
actually kind of works and if you don't

00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,600
believe me it's all on code sandbox it

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,010
also as allows you to have actions this

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,750
is what I'm trying to work on this is

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:26,650
like the name this is not done like at

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,480
all zero done and you can have also

00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,340
custom styles for stuff so in this case

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,140
at a reporter radius of 50 and a border

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,360
of none and it has a cursor:pointer and

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,070
if I come in here you can see that it

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,250
actually has a cursor:pointer and that

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:42,280
actually works and the actions also work

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:46,360
 no oh yeah it does look J zero so

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:49,090
sup so this is not production-ready

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,900
notion and it's literally still on code

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,370
sandbox but it's something like and it

00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,600
wasn't that easy it wasn't that hard

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:59,530
sorry about that it's just a lot of

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,060
recursion on recursion and it's it's

00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,380
some code sandbox you can use it however

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,110
you feel please don't use it on

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,970
production I know this doesn't work when

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,590
Mac when the diner bro mom says don't

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,180
use it on production but please don't

00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:15,400
cuz it all relies on position:absolute

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:17,440
and you really want that yeah so maybe

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,060
react components maybe I can get this to

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,290
work with flags box and something and

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:25,330
then basically you can export your figma

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,070
file and all of your components are on a

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,380
style guide in figma and just turning

00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,630
into react components and that would be

00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,850
dope because if you put them all in

00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,650
different pages cuz this is this like

00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,690
what i did doesn't really work if you

00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,570
have like a gigantic page but it like it

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,090
kinda works for small stuff so it's a

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,470
really cool thing for you to like

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:48,190
exports little things and use them

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,930
everywhere everywhere on react and

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,610
you're like okay that that sounds like

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,740
that sounds like a thing that exists

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,870
that you just made up but okay but why

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,900
should I do this you have way more

00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,990
maintainable styles like it's insane

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,120
it's

00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,480
insanely we aren't maintainable so this

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,700
project that I'm in we have zero zero

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:11,660
CSS in the actual project all of the CSS

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,880
in j/s is on the style guide there is no

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:16,220
CSS pretty much except for like icons

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,620
and stuff so like all the greens are now

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,059
the same green because there's only one

00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,120
green it's amazing

00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:24,350
you have Willis specific parts so I used

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,300
to have a lot of bugs that were like

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,400
when like when there's a full moon and

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,679
the werewolf comes to town this screen

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,590
is not the same as that green all the

00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,450
same green dope and also have one source

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,770
of truth this is the best thing if

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,030
you're dealing with project managers or

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,590
something we're just like it's not

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,760
supposed to look like this well it looks

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,710
like this on a style guide so that's

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,970
what I'm doing and then you can just

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:49,480
walk away I have done this it was dope I

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,920
didn't get fired you can totally do it

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,030
again I got promoted to team leader so I

00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,900
didn't get a pay raise though I was

00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:02,270
promoted it was like oh oh you wanna you

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,559
want to lead a team is like yeah I get a

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,040
pay raise what no oh okay so I have a

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,150
choice

00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,270
No okay it's so much better for unit

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,440
testing like the idea of unit testing is

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,340
not to test like you retire your

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,440
homepage and that's that's not the idea

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:23,690
today the unit unit testing was it began

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,179
as an idea to test one function in react

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,670
our functions or our components so you

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:31,070
test components and the best idea is to

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,010
test small components it's not to test

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,890
entire can put entire trees of Dom nodes

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,770
and everything so you get an isolated

00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,390
thing for it you can isolate early test

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,270
your components it's it's beautiful I

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:46,610
promise in my opinion like UI

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,620
development is generally better because

00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,290
you have one source of truth and you

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,230
also you don't have to write overwrite

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:58,910
CSS every time you do something because

00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:00,260
you can react and view and and I don't

00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,870
know I've been worked with angular since

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,190
version 1 but we have props like we have

00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,440
props that we can pass it that

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,370
completely change the components don't

00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,350
have a component that does everything

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,880
like Jack said don't have like this is

00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:12,500
the home page component that's not how

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,789
it works

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,409
blood

00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:17,210
you can change things and you can make

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:18,919
you better and you can change the design

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,749
you can change everything you can be a

00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,629
happier human being sometimes it's a

00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:26,029
choice and that is my talk thank you so

00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:28,310
much my slides are in there and they're

00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:32,260
also on code sandbox

00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,260
[Applause]
