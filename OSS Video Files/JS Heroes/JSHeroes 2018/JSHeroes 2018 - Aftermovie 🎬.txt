00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,630
AGS heroes it's super nice to be here

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,940
and I've actually looked forward to the

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,800
past two months to go here so it's super

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,239
nice that I can now be in Romania and we

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,890
talk here it's it's nice I mean it seems

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,129
to be very community driven I like that

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,769
a lot

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,800
it makes it a bit cozy cozier than other

00:00:46,769 --> 00:01:00,310
country and so I appreciate that a lot

00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:01,960
I just had discussion guys from

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,930
Lithuania and I know that book some

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,880
people came from Germany check public so

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,740
it now it's a truly international

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,260
conference you can see it in the lineup

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,390
for the lineup it's great I don't think

00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,310
that even the greatest like with huge

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:19,030
budgets conferences once you have

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:22,460
federal islands and then chess you

00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,330
[Music]

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,310
[Applause]

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,080
unless obvious change for me is how much

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,850
bigger it is like when I walked into the

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,770
room there were there were way more

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,590
chairs than we've been last year and

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,630
when we had lunch it was just there was

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,540
barely any room to move there so I mean

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,040
it was good it's a good problem so

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,630
that's cool I mean that shows that it's

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,370
really resonating with people here and

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,820
people really want to get involved and

00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,770
for me it's really cool to see that

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,050
something that's really designed to put

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,400
inclusion that it seems to be working

00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,050
[Music]

00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,610
the conference itself is like super

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,190
unique I haven't been to anything like

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,229
this before there's a lot of engagement

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,150
and there's an amazing community here

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,710
I'm meeting a lot of amazing people over

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,380
here and we've got a lot of amazing

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,260
questions speaker line-up was super cool

00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,940
it was very diverse and I actually had

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,720
an amazing time here I'm looking forward

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,720
to rest of the talks today

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:24,540
it's so exciting when I lived here there

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,410
was no JavaScript

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,330
and it's everywhere and there's a

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,640
conference it's so good I love it

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,170

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,910

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,620

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,090
so many people nouvelle components

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,520
I was really exciting I didn't expect

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,020
that it was great so well organized it

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,850

everyone and everything is on time and

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,180
the food is delicious and the coffee

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,320
line is really short all the time a bus

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,570
bus would come again

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,280
I love the conference I've been here

00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,470

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,700
organizers and everyone has been like

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,770
