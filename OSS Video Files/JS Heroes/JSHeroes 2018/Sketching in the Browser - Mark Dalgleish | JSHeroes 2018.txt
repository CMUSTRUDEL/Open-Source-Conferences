Title: Sketching in the Browser - Mark Dalgleish | JSHeroes 2018
Publication date: 2018-05-02
Playlist: JSHeroes 2018
Description: 
	Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry, with both disciplines working in completely different mediums. Lately, we've seen the emergence of tools like react-sketchapp and html-sketchapp that allow us to generate Sketch libraries from our application code. In this talk, we'll run through a real-world example of this technique, have a closer look at how it all works, and show you how you can start experimenting with this yourself. Most importantly, we'll talk about what this means for the future of design.

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,240
yes so since I have the honor of being

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,440
the first speaker I think once again I

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,789
want to say big thank you to all the

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,230
organizers for putting on this event I

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:28,410
think they deserve a massive round of

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:29,910
applause so yeah as you heard my name is

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,890
Mike Douglas I'm here all the way from

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,380
Melbourne Australia a really really long

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,110
way but I'm really happy to be here if

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,160
you've been following me at all I'm sure

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,629
you're aware that what I'm really

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,700
passionate about and have been for the

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,120
past few years is the combination of

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,760
component architectures specifically in

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,050
the react community and design systems

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,170
and how we can bring the world of design

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,730
and development together it's the

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,590
combination of these two things that

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,090
helped to kick off my work with CSS

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
modules probably what I'm most well

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,180
known for and I'm sure a few of you are

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,439
using in production apps today as I am

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,689
but what I'm really interested in is

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,220
what all of this means for the future of

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,350
design in our industry and where we're

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,689
going as a community and how we're going

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,490
to work together in the future so I

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,439
think this is a really exciting space to

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,330
be looking at if not actively working in

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,600
today and I hope you'll you'll find some

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,040
value out of my perspective on this so

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,840
I've been working in this area at a

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,680
company called seek in Australia they're

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,810
the leading job site there and we've had

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,090
a lot of active work in the design

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,130
system space for the past year and a

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,619
half I've been working full time on our

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,990
living style guide which is a react

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,119
component suite and supporting tool set

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,979
as well so this has been a huge success

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,750
internally for us it's really changed

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,000
the way we think about how we design and

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,530
develop together and this is open source

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,790
as well so a few of you have probably

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,630
already seen it but if you haven't

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,210
please do check it out of course it

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,850
didn't start this way building up a

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,740
component system a design system of this

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,159
sort takes a lot of work over many years

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,049
usually in our case it started as a

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,310
static style guide it was the designers

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,250
at the company getting together and

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,170
saying we need to define as a group what

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,000
design at seek is

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,410
for ourselves but of course for people

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,370
who are building it and people who are

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,750
making decisions about design and so on

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,670
it wasn't long after that that that

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,560
design tooling started to change quite

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,000
significantly sketch really started to

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,700
take off and one of the great things

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,260
about sketches it's got a an abstraction

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,770
called symbols which is very much like

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,320
components in a component system this is

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,720
our open source sketch library that

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,670
picked up a bit of steam internally so

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,990
it's just a relatively small set of

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,730
symbols that were commonly used

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,470
throughout a lot of our projects and it

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,050
was just enough to get designers up to

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,450
speed with the basics of designing a UI

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,010
inside of our company

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,960
the problem though was that those were

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,720
scoped to a single document

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,420
we looked into tools like craft which is

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,760
a plug-in suite for sketch by envision

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,800
most notably they have a library plugin

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,300
and what it does is it allows you to

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,940
take those symbols that we saw before

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,370
and more easily share them across an

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,650
entire group of designers and have

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,200
people contribute back and keep it up to

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,690
date and have it have a live living set

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,700
of symbols that you can use in your in

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,230
your day-to-day design work so as you

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,209
can see here someone's designing a

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,020
native application and they're pulling

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,640
in symbols from that sidebar there the

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,880
challenge of course is that it took a

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,260
lot of work so there's of course the the

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,510
most obvious work of keeping this

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,910
library up to date purely from a design

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,700
standpoint as designers iterate and

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,810
revise on our design standards but the

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,480
challenge of course is that we're

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,130
building real live applications across

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,930
many teams and those teams themselves

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,150
often are iterating on these design

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,310
patterns in the code so as the code

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,380
changes how do our designs stay up today

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,270
it's basically a full-time job to keep

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,430
track of all these changes and to keep

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,830
that central design repository

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,020
up-to-date it was around this time that

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,400
we started investing in react so what

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,800
really drew us to react in the first

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,180
place was its server-side rendering

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,709
capabilities particularly for SEO and

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,350
what we were really surprised about was

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,520
how its component architecture really

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,850
changed the way we think about

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,740
development and design it's had a huge

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,210
impact on us internally and I think

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,590
we've seen the exact same thing play out

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,010
at companies all over the world and I'm

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,950
sure it's happening for you as well

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,910
it was out of this work that CSS modules

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,500
really became a thing our project was I

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,450
guess technically the first CSS modules

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,190
project in the world and it's been

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:43,390
really exciting for us to see it take

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,130
off all over the place here in Cluj if

00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,620
you looked inside of that first project

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,150
that we created we created this little

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,610
modules directory of things that we

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,740
wanted to share openly in the future but

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,780
weren't quite ready and that's where our

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,700
six style guide began its life so we

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,590
started putting react components in

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,000
there that we thought were usable across

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,150
the whole application and theoretically

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,590
usable across the whole company that of

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,660
course worked really well and led

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,820
naturally to it being freed from that

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,680
folder inside of a project into its own

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,260
standalone repository on github

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,880
published into NPM and teams all

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,040
throughout the company started picking

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,300
up on this and it's become the standard

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,010
toolkit throughout a company today the

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,080
challenge here is how do we feed back

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,820
into design again we still have this

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,280
problem that as our component library

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,600
continues to evolve how to designers

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,430
stay up to date with all these decisions

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,990
that are happening on a daily basis pull

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,640
requests are being merged literally as

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,110
I'm preparing to come up on stage right

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,100
pull requests reviews are happening as

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,190
we speak and this work needs to happen

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,390
to keep everything up to date luckily

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,980
for us Airbnb

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,780
have been pioneering in this space for

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,930
quite a while and they've been happy to

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,060
share their work as was mentioned by

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,710
Alex last year I finished up this

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,480
conference talking about CSS and jeaious

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,100
and I touched on react Sketchup as being

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,560
a big part of what's interesting about

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,450
that space so if you're not sure what

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,490
react Sketchup is it's basically a

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,500
reactor renderer for sketch as the name

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,850
might suggest so as you can see here on

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,010
the left you've got some pretty standard

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,110
looking react code or I guess react

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,370
native code in this case and you look on

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,310
the right there and you can see it's

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,840
being rendered into sketch pretty

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,780
amazing stuff and when I saw it it

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,390
completely blew me away and it's and

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,830
it's been a big influencer in terms of

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,040
how I think about the design system

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,720
space John Gould from Airbnb when he

00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,910
released this project he said in sketch

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,890
we use symbols and overrides and react

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,420
we use components and properties the

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,060
concepts are so similar that it seems

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,810
silly not to unify them when you see

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,490
this play out

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,530
in a more traditional design process

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,720
it's it's pretty incredible so this is

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,310
an animation they released of what it

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,570
looks like internally so you can see

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,830
there on the Left there's a panel where

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,780
they're selecting the component from

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,120
their design system they're adjusting

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,590
the properties of that symbol as you

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,900
would do as a developer working and

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,550
react when they finish they create an

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,590
instance of that and drag it there onto

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,750
the artboard and sketch where what you

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,450
end up with is something that is pretty

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,100
fluid as a design tool but based in the

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,380
real source of truth in the code so as

00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,240
that code continues to evolve not only

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,700
is the production application changing

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,990
but the the next round of design is

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:21,550
being updated as well pretty incredible

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,830
unfortunately for us it came with a few

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,229
requirements and I'm sure this would

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,540
trip up most of you I would say in this

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,889
room if you wanted to try this out the

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,510
first requirement as you can probably

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,190
guess is that you have to use react now

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,500
a lot of us use react we use react so

00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,000
that's not an issue but there's got to

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,229
be at least one person in this room who

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,080
that's already you know that's really a

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,370
problem for you for us that was fine the

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,710
second requirement is you had to write

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,150
your Styles in JavaScript now again last

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,190
year I was here talking all about the

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,220
virtues of CSS and J's I'm definitely a

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,390
fan of CSS nsj but that wasn't that

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,130
isn't the tech choice that we've made

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,979
internally and we're not sure if we're

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,919
ready to migrate there are good reasons

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:01,870
why we continue to use CSS modules so

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,700
that was a bit of a challenge for us and

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,350
finally we would have to build

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,330
everything with cross platform

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,870
primitives so that means view text image

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,220
no divs and spans and h2s we you can't

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,229
couple yourself to the web browser

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,000
because sketch is not a web browser and

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,620
another way of thinking about it is

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,150
basically you have to write your code as

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,639
if it's react native code and then

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,050
target the different environments and so

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,539
that's that was a real challenge for us

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,220
I was really disappointed that we

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,750
couldn't make use of it immediately but

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,400
what I really wanted to do is see if if

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,419
we could find some sort of temporary

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,070
solution to at least get us on this path

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,240
the biggest problem we have to solve is

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,370
the fact that we didn't have a single

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,650
source of truth and whatever tech choice

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,089
we make in the future the one thing that

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,250
we were aiming for was that the git

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,690
repository should be the source of truth

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,490
in our design system because that it

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,300
that is the one thing that you can tie

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:53,890
into production applications and as it

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,340
continues to evolve we can we can make

00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,220
sure that

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,510
at least everyone's on that same page

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,790
one idea that people are often quick to

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,860
write off including myself is how about

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,290
you just check those design assets into

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,970
the repository itself and funnily enough

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,160
sketch actually makes this possible

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,920
based on its file format which we'll go

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,540
into a bit more detail later and in our

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,730
case we actually wrote some custom node

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,230
scripts to be able to convert sketch

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,930
files into a format we could check in

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,970
luckily there's actually a nice easy

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,370
visual tool called cactus with like the

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,280
cutest logo ever and it's basically a

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,750
good client for sketch files you can see

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,370
the the raw files that you're checking

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,100
in on the left there and you can see a

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,540
diff before and after it's it's a pretty

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,960
great tool it's open source you can go

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,000
check that out unfortunately for us it

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,240
never really worked out the way we

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,890
wanted to because even though it made

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,050
the problem clearer in the sense that

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,910
now as people were contributing to our

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,440
living style guide they were now aware

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,000
that at the same time as updating say a

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,840
button they should update button dot

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,350
sketch it didn't actually solve the

00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,050
problem

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,820
because now if anything it became more

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,980
painfully obvious that we were doing

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,080
this double handling of design and

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,670
development work and not everyone had

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,920
the right tools or experience to make

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,480
both changes and coordinating it was was

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,520
really hard and actually slowed things

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,590
down to the point that people actually

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,060
just kind of gave up on it and I'd say

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,300
it was for us it was a it was a failed

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,520
experiment so we were a little bit

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,620
disheartened at this point the ideal of

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,600
react Sketchup we couldn't quite use

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,250
trying to check in the assets that we

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,560
were already working on that didn't

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,260
quite work so we weren't sure what the

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,140
next step for us was the timing could

00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:39,070
not have been much better though because

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:42,250
if you look at this list of requirements

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,830
for using react Sketchup they're pretty

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,170
pretty common problems that people would

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,610
have with it I'm sure like I said most

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,280
of you in this room if you wanted to try

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,180
it out would run into these issues

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,010
Conrad's winel from a company called

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,720
brainley ran into exactly these and he

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,310
said we were unable to quickly work

00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,560
around these limitations so we created

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,390
HTML Sketchup and if you're wondering

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,620
about HTML Sketchup is well it's a tool

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,420
that popped up on my Twitter feed

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,880
randomly one day thanks to John Gould as

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,230
well and I looked at the readme for it

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,680
and this is what I saw basically

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,750
it's it's a tool that lets you take

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,640
generic web content and render it into

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,440
sketch so here you can see on the Left

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,330
they've got their their company style

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,770
guide being rendered their Conrad's

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,080
Twitter account

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,340
you've got Stack Overflow duckduckgo you

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,920
know if you think about it these are all

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,450
just random kind of generic web content

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,830
with all sorts of different technology

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,880
on both the back end and the front end

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:35,710
and yet here it is all in sketch so I

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,560
couldn't really believe my eyes here I

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,670
thought this was really incredible I

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,620
touched on it earlier I'm gonna go into

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,900
more detail now the reason why this is

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,970
possible is because if sketches open

00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,530
file format and this is a relatively new

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,890
thing for sketcher didn't always have

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,150
this so a nice little secret about

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,100
sketch files is that they're actually

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,810
zip files so if you if you work with

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,850
sketch if you have a sketch file on your

00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,410
machine go ahead and rename it to dot

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,820
zip and extract it and you'll see

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,740
something like this so you've just got

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,380
some JSON files a couple of folders

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,490
there with thumbnails and so on

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,590
everything that's in a sketch file is

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,750
basically there in plain text for you to

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,190
have a look at if you open one of those

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,020
JSON files you'll see something like

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,280
this that at first glance might look a

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,110
bit intimidating but when you actually

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,050
drill in it's really just a small

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,240
handful of instances of these classes

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,400
with some relatively human readable

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,350
properties it's at least simple enough

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,360
that you can easily reverse engineer it

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,340
right open up sketch create a rectangle

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,460
have a look at the Jason see what you

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,250
got and that's basically what Conrad did

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,920
it at brainley now if you look at HTML

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,390
sketch up what it gives you is a set of

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,190
classes so you can programmatically

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,770
generate instances of that jason we saw

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,870
before but the most impressive part of

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,950
the tool is that last one nodes node to

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,830
sketch layers and it's a function

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,800
included in HTML sketch up that lets you

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,000
pass it an HTML element from a Dom

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,190
element sorry from the browser and

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,970
convert it into an array of layers

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:03,670
inside of sketch the end of that process

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,590
is a couple of files JSON files similar

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,740
to what we saw before document a sketch

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,000
Jason and page a sketch Jason and I know

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,500
what you're thinking what's this a

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
sketch because that's what I was

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,100
thinking of course and that's short for

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,780
almost sketch

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,880
unfortunately this I won't go into

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,400
detail but there are some restrictions

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,850
in terms of the the sketch file format

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,069
where

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,100
a couple of things basically can't be

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,420
created outside of sketch hopefully that

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,069
will go away one day but basically it

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,769
means that these JSON files need to be

00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:34,060
imported into sketch via a plugin but

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:35,589
for the most part it's all automated

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,740
there is that one manual step but that's

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,209
it so when I saw this again I couldn't

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:44,319
believe it I wanted to take it for a

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:46,319
spin I charted my progress on Twitter so

00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,790
some of you may have seen this already

00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:51,040
the first thing I wanted to do to kind

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,889
of get a Minimum Viable you know example

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,259
of using this with the least effort was

00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,480
to just point it at the website not

00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,829
trying to build a component system just

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,589
point it at a page and see what I get

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,970
and so you can see if you remember what

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,339
it look like before it's pretty close

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,319
the only thing the only things that

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:10,209
really struggled with was the the SVG so

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,519
at the time it didn't have s to be SVG

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:14,170
support we hacked our way around that

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,000
but they actually have SVG support now

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,620
the other thing is well if you see the

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,019
text up the top it's a little bit weird

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,449
we've for accessibility reasons we had

00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,980
some hidden text that text was no longer

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:26,139
hidden in sketch so we had to hack our

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,600
way around that but generally it worked

00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:30,459
it worked pretty well so the next

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,769
obvious step for me was to try and build

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,240
up some of these actual usable elements

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,639
within sketch so the first stop was

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,189
symbols again symbols basically being

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,319
the same as components so I started

00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:44,079
rendering out our buttons in various

00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:45,610
formats and I was able to get that into

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,290
sketch as a set of symbols so on the

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,029
right there you can see the three

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,410
different symbols and these are reusable

00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:52,300
within sketch so you can create

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,240
different instances of these and also

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,740
change the text as well internally the

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,319
way we made this work and easy for

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,420
developers is we made it so that inside

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:03,790
of our button folder for example there

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,639
would be a button sketch jeaious and it

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,500
just exported an object of symbols like

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,970
this where each key was the name of the

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,009
symbol that we wanted inside of sketch

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,160
and the value was a react element to

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:17,199
render to the screen we took this same

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,269
concept to our textiles so our type

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,160
hierarchy we created an object of

00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,779
textiles where again the key is the name

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,579
of the entry and the type hierarchy and

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,380
the value is a react element that we

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,850
want to render to the screen so we

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,189
iterate over those render them into the

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,480
browser capture them into sketch and it

00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:33,189
looks something like this within sketch

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,470
so you can open this style text menu

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:36,850
we've got all of the entries there

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,790
again coming from the source of truth

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,200
encode into the design tool

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,580
the other big thing of course is our

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,680
color palette there's a lot more than

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,720
this but basically all of our colors at

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,550
seeker defined in less largely for

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,860
historical reasons we convert that into

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,180
JavaScript we iterate over that render

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,470
it to the page which looks something

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,470
like this so we've got our full color

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,410
palette available to be extracted into

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,550
sketch which again from the sketch point

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,680
of view looks something like this you've

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,750
got your document colors and laid out

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,340
there for designers to use and this is

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,220
very much standard for a sketch tool to

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,600
have this and and again all of this

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,810
coming from the code as the source of

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,390
truth now in our case our website is

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,950
responsive and our style guide in turn

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,170
is also responsive and so we came up

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,090
with a system of defining the viewports

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,620
that we wanted to render out so we could

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,480
consistently take a view across

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,400
everything in our system at the sizes

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,750
that we want we made a configurable so

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,940
it's easy to update so there you can see

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,430
we've got desktop and mobile mobile plus

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,080
as well for us symbols with the right

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,150
resolutions that we want to target and

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,470
you go over to sketch and this is what

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,150
you see for every entry in our type

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,310
hierarchy we had a desktop version and a

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,050
mobile version you went into all the

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,630
symbols and likewise you had desktop

00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,640
mobile mobile plus available and this

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,140
was fully automated so all the rules in

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,670
code about how it should rearrange are

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,720
the different screen sizes were all

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,910
captured in our sketch symbols here all

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,380
of that culminated in this one long page

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,910
so you can see me scrolling through here

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,040
so just top to bottom it's everything

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,530
from our style guide that we want to

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,570
export into sketch and we just snapshot

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,980
every one of these things and automate

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,770
the process of pulling that into sketch

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,190
so this worked really well for us and

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,540
we're continuing to use this to this day

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,730
now it wasn't long after I got started

00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,500
this was December 1st last year that I

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,880
said it's happening just opened the PR

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,620
that automatically converts our style

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,770
guide components into a sketch library

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,000
with HTML Sketch up I was I couldn't

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,520
been much more excited about actually

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,470
seeing this work in such a short period

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,210
of time too but it's really worth

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,980
calling out that HTML Sketch up was only

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,390
one part of the puzzle of getting that

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,810
to work there was a little wiring

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,310
required if you look at the the API that

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,800
I talked about before this isn't the

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,780
this isn't the the entire API but it's

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,130
basically gives you a sense of it it's

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,340
pretty low-level right you can create

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,790
instances of classes

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,290
you can convert a Dom element to layers

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,660
but how do you actually turn that into a

00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,240
full end-to-end solution for getting

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,370
content out of a browser and into sketch

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,740
in our case we had to create a lot of

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,290
custom code inside of our style guide to

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,780
perform this process first we had to

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,550
compile an HTML sketch app script that

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,930
included HTML sketch app and the code

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,880
for extracting everything from the page

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,310
we compiled that with a web pack ahead

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,840
of time we had to start up a static web

00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,700
server that we could then reference

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,160
during the process we had to open

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,200
puppeteer which is a headless version of

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,850
Chrome or chromium and we had to point

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,890
it at the URL for that static web server

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,070
that we just started up to inject the

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,450
the script that we compiled in step one

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,550
we then had to make use of that script

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,200
which would use to capture the symbols

00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:40,400
resize the window for all the different

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,610
viewports repeat that process finally we

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,870
had to write the JSON to disk shut down

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,820
the static web server shut down

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,290
puppeteer and of course if anything went

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,280
wrong in any of these steps we had to

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,960
make sure everything got cleaned up

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,660
correctly and so on so there's a lot of

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,220
plumbing for what is really kind of at a

00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,480
high level a simple task that we're

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,180
trying to perform conceptually it's

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,590
really just one thing and so I had an

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,690
idea generally whenever I see this

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,250
discrepancy between the simplicity of

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,750
the task you want to do it just at a

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,890
high level you know if you to explain to

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,780
someone else what you're doing and it's

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,690
just like one sentence and yet the

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,700
amount of work that you have to do is as

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,230
long as we just saw and including all

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,330
the dependencies required for all of

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,730
that usually that's an opportunity for a

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,250
tool the creation of some kind of new

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,990
tool and so off the back of this I

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,850
started work on a project called HTML

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,700
Sketchup CLI which is open-source and

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,440
you can make use of this today you can

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,780
just npm install it and start using it

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,190
and it basically looks like this all of

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,600
that process that you saw before gets

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,940
wrapped up into something as simple as

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,560
this you just say HTML sketch up in this

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,210
case we're pointing it at an HTML file

00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,030
and we're telling it which directory

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,620
what we want to export to being a

00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,840
JavaScript tool of course it's got its

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,430
own config file if you want to do that

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,870
and that makes it a bit easier to define

00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,190
things like viewports you've got your

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,160
named viewports they're a desktop and

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,500
mobile this is pretty much the config

00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,700
that we use at seek so the first bit of

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,200
config there is saying that we actually

00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,150
want to start up a static web server

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,540
from our that the disk directory in our

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,080
docs

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,460
for

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,049
so that again that automates the process

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,110
of starting up that static server

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:13,620
pointing at that URL resizing the window

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,480
at those viewports and so on now the one

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,460
opinion that we kind of have to baked

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,889
into the project for this to work so

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,440
simply is that we have to know in your

00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:24,330
page how do we actually find the things

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,970
that you want to expose as symbols as

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,440
textiles as colors so we came up with a

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,379
pretty straightforward convention of

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,139
data sketch symbol attribute or text or

00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:36,059
color attributes where the value is the

00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:37,619
name of the symbol or the textile or in

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,999
the case of color since colors

00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:41,220
unfortunately aren't named in sketch

00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:42,600
it's just the value of the color and

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,249
that gives us the hook to select

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,200
everything from the page that you want

00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:48,240
to export but otherwise anything that's

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,720
in the browser that's nested inside of

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,990
these is good to go so we started using

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,190
this internally on our style guide and

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,799
it was pretty exciting to see it

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,570
actually being used for real but the the

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,419
real sign of success for me was this the

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,759
fact that once we merge that p.r a lot

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,259
of code got deleted so obviously that's

00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,879
great for me personally on my own

00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,019
project to just get a heap of code out

00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,580
of there until place where I can

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,710
actually like work on it and test it and

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,970
document it separately but that means

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,440
that for each one of you in this room

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,909
when you go back to work and you want to

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,769
try this out that's the difference right

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,059
between where I was and where you are if

00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,570
you want to start doing this right so

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,860
it's pretty cool where I get excited

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,480
about it though of course it's not just

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,830
tooling for tooling sake it's what it

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,190
means as part of a larger ecosystem

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,659
within a community within a company and

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,519
for us it's all about building out this

00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,809
continuous design pipeline building

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,669
bringing the world of continuous

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,700
integration continuous delivery to the

00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,350
world of design so in our case anytime a

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,850
pull request gets merged into master and

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,919
like I said this is happening literally

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,080
as I'm preparing for this talk

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:51,210
once that PR gets merged into master we

00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,789
deploy the documentation site again to

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,970
github pages with a really cool CLI tool

00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:59,340
called gh-pages we automatically publish

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,139
to NPM with an amazing tool called

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,309
semantic release which we could not live

00:22:01,139 --> 00:22:05,490
without I could go on and on about

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,259
semantic release and finally obviously

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,119
in the context of this talk we generate

00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:12,210
all these almost sketch files that are

00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:14,519
ready to be imported into sketch now

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,240
from the designers point of view it's

00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:18,460
really really cool

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,810
so we've got this sketch library so

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,540
sketch has a concept of libraries you

00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,610
can open a sketch file and say add is

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,230
library and it's now available in any

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,000
sketch file that you're working on in

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,560
your machine so you can see here we've

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,200
got this menu at the top that says seek

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,870
style guide library so that's always

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,220
available and you go down the list and

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,260
it's everything that we've exported from

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,550
our living style guide you drill down so

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,930
here we've got buttons you've got all

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,400
the different styles of buttons and

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,080
again you drill down to that and you've

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,020
got the different sizes desktop mobile

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,760
mobile plus and as I said this has

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,340
always kept up to date so we encourage

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,900
the designers in the company to point to

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,550
a central version that we have an out on

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,900
our shared drive

00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,930
I don't like shared drives but that's

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,430
what designers use and that Kay that

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,350
stays up-to-date so every time we update

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,240
that file all the designers get the

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,270
latest version and and they're actually

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,250
using it like unlike the the cactus

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,840
example I showed earlier designers are

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,210
often coming up to me and asking me hey

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,210
is that new component or the new symbol

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,830
in the library yet so it's pretty cool

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,270
now in practice when you're designing an

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,490
actual page it looks something like this

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,230
now this is slightly sped up but all up

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,660
this is about a minutes worth of work

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,130
that you're seeing and it's really not

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,290
that much work you know it's pulling in

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,800
symbols from the library I'm adjusting

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,980
the the overrides to customize the text

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,540
and you can see we've generated a

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,210
sign-in form for sake that looks pretty

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,160
standard and we can know for a fact that

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,810
everything that we've we've used here is

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,250
pretty much what you're going to get if

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,510
you were to ask a developer to build it

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,620
because it's again pulling from those

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:52,600
same primitives now I could go on and on

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,580
about that in isolation I could end the

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,960
talk there but I think it's worth

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,580
calling out that for me this is really

00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,260
just the beginning of a much bigger

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,320
shift in the way we think about design

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,500
and design tooling and and the the the

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,300
way we interact across that boundary

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,400
this tools like composite a lab for

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,400
example that allows you to work on a

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,320
style guide in a visual way but the

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,820
output isn't static files or mock-ups

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,430
the output is actual code that can run

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,620
in your project and code that's really

00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:23,160
meeting developers on their terms you

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,180
know generating NPM packages for example

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,430
compositor is a suite of tools so

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,050
there's tools that allow you to build

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,130
larger things out of those components

00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,700
and rearrange them in a vision

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:35,500
away it's really a rebirth of WYSIWYG

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,820
editors in the in the era of components

00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,810
I think it's it's actually due for a

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,980
comeback now that we've got the

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,630
abstraction a bit more correct there's

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,940
tools like haiku which is more of your

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,910
kind of traditional animation tool on

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:52,840
the surface but again the output is like

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,430
NPM packages it's not snippets for you

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,560
to copy and paste it's not static files

00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,630
it's like live code it's really designed

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,250
to try and integrate into the way we all

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:05,920
work for real tools like module Studio

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,510
which is still in development and again

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,220
it looks like your traditional you know

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,540
WYSIWYG editor it's like we're back in

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,250
the Dreamweaver days you might think

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,230
that's a bad thing but the difference is

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,090
that you're not just working with the

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,590
lowest level primitives you're working

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,480
with primitives that you get to define

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,490
and that's where the concept actually

00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,250
starts to make more sense it starts to

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,560
make sense again I didn't have time to

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,570
update my slides builder X they're a

00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,280
sponsor of this event they're in the

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,070
space as well so go talk to them however

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,670
who's from bill directs anyone no no

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,740
one's here okay talk to me about it

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:42,580
so yeah I mean there's a lot of people

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,860
working in this space UX pin actually

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,270
talking about time I put this in this

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,800
morning because they tweeted it this out

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,690
this morning UX pin are getting into the

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,150
space as well why I'm really interested

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,660
in UX pin is that they're at this scene

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:57,670
as a more traditional design tool

00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,020
designers are using UX pin today but

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,570
they're promoting the fact that they're

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:04,720
actually about to add a major support

00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,640
for code being imported into the design

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,750
tool very much like what we're hacking

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,760
into sketch they're making it a

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:11,110
first-class part of the product and

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,120
that's where I think things are gonna

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,930
get really exciting I'm keen to get off

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,310
hacks and do it you know properly

00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,320
interplay is another one that I've

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,280
actually had been able to get my hands

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,070
on so you can see here I'm actually

00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,930
designing something for sake and again

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,280
it's pulling in those components that

00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,750
we've defined in our system not

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,400
low-level primitives that they define

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,830
and that's that's the key difference so

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,660
it's pretty pretty amazing stuff and so

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,970
these are all you know design tools that

00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,180
people are actively working on some are

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:42,280
open-source some are paid but I think

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,960
we're definitely seeing a massive change

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,020
in the way people think about the

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,280
design process as a whole to me these

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,370
these tools are all about truly

00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,870
embracing the Design Systems era trying

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,490
to get the world of code and design to

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,980
work together in a way that we we

00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:00,280
haven't worked before and really trying

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,630
to improve the way we collaborate it's

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,570
about getting that feedback loop from

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,220
design to code and back that last point

00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:08,080
is the key thing that's been missing in

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,360
the history of design in terms of how

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,490
I've experienced it because often what

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,200
will happen as designers will give you a

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,880
nice design you'll translate it to code

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,550
and then you'll iterate on that code and

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,870
make it even better but it won't make

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,160
its way back into the next round of

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,330
design and that's starting to change

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,590
what's really interesting for us and

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,030
something to think about is it means it

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,980
actually starts to change the nature of

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,870
our role within of our within our

00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,180
companies because we're becoming

00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:36,400
custodians of design not merely

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,930
implementers we actually have to

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,670
understand the rules and translate them

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,350
correctly into a set of components that

00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,270
can be then imported into these tools

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,680
and that that actually changes the

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,210
relationship between designers and

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,710
developers we've seen this play out

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,820
internally at seek and I'm sure that

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,470
this is playing out at companies all

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,790
over the world and these tools are going

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,700
to make that that the need for that

00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:56,020
collaboration even greater so the

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,820
question I want to leave you with a

00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,560
question that I'm still working through

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,760
the details of is what does this mean

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,760
for the future of front-end development

00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,170
what does this mean for what we do at

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,220
work and how we collaborate with those

00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,840
around us what does it mean for

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,730
designers and their design tools what

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,040
does it mean from what we expect from

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,750
our tooling and what does it mean in

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,540
terms of the quality of what we produce

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:17,590
ultimately that that's the end goal

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,270
there's a lot of open questions and

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,650
there's a lot of work to be done but

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,770
most of all there's a there's a culture

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,240
shift coming and a mindset shift and the

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,310
best way to get ready for that is to

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,860
start start working today so I encourage

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,540
you if you're interested in the space at

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,060
all get started today

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,740
start sketching in the browser start

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,130
hacking your way into traditional design

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,080
tools

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,970
it'll get better but now is the perfect

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,740
time to start and I hope if you're at

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,530
all interested you will join me on this

00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,270
pretty exciting journey that's it for my

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,080
talk for today and thank you for

00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,349
listening

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,349
[Applause]
