Description: 
	Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry, with both disciplines working in completely different mediums. Lately, we've seen the emergence of tools like react-sketchapp and html-sketchapp that allow us to generate Sketch libraries from our application code. In this talk, we'll run through a real-world example of this technique, have a closer look at how it all works, and show you how you can start experimenting with this yourself. Most importantly, we'll talk about what this means for the future of design.
