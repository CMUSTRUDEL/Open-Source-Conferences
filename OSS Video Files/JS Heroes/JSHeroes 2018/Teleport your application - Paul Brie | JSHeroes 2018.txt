00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,320
hi everybody

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,030
I'll just take two minutes not two

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,670
minutes two seconds to make a mental

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,900
picture this is an awesome crowd it's

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,760
unbelievable thank you for being here

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:28,050
I'm very excited to be in front of you

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:33,300
today I would like to talk to you about

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:38,250
a journey which has lasted about a year

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,700
and a half now and we arrived today at

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,290
the first milestone of this journey to

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,370
this presentation which is actually

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,030
somehow semi official launch of a new

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,390
product so don't be afraid I'm not gonna

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,770
try to sell you anything we're just

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,680
going to talk about the journey not that

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:05,610
much about the product so I'm going to

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,450
talk about a possible future for user

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,229
interfaces just a couple of words about

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:18,570
myself

00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:21,659
definitely a dreamer a day dreamer and I

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,000
really like to think that being a bit

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,070
reckless at times allows you to go the

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,860
extra step I think probably a couple

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,920
people in the room are laughing inside

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,960
but it's quite essential and this

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:43,409
reckless capability has been maintained

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:47,040
and nurtured by of course many

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,920
experience in the past but in this case

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,479
especially by free persons that I would

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,950
like to mention and you have a meal a

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,750
very good friend colleague I consider

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,079
him as being one of my mentors when it

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:09,060
comes about free thinking Chris which

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,879
was met a year and a half ago more or

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,060
less another guy we really enhanced my

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,440
free thinking

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,680
and Gabi the CEO of Amazon who supported

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,840
all my craziness over the last years and

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,720
who really made possible for this idea

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:33,190
to develop and to eventually transform

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:35,620
into our product so all this journey

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,900
happens a year and a half ago it's

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,330
basically a mixture between a couple of

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,019
ideas that got into collision at the

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,269
time I met Christy and Christy was

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,220
pretty much into autonomous and

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:54,850
distributed systems and like we had an

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:59,400
unbelievable talk and I was really

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:02,530
mesmerized by his ideas at the same time

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,269
I was pretty much into chatbots and

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:08,319
we're trying to explore possibilities

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:10,709
and another topic that was on my plates

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,349
during my R&D time at Apple zone was

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:16,690
using their faces building which is

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:20,230
basically a bit of the topic that we

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,489
have today and the beauty of this story

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,590
I think is that it started with the what

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,380
we call the job Bob project jo Bob

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,400
project was a project in which the rule

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,170
was don't have any boundaries don't have

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,430
any limits to how you would think about

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:41,470
technology and I think when I look for

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,799
all these years that I pass into the IT

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,620
industry I always tried to make my

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,139
development tools better to be a better

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,600
developer to be a better communicator to

00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:54,220
make projects better and obviously this

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
takes a lot of time and you know that

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,900
because there are so many libraries that

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,959
you would like to control to know and

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,700
somehow this proliferation of technology

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,480
takes a lot of time from your thinking

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,480
time and puts you into a very very good

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,790
executor time but still you don't have

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,470
that much time to think so

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,680
when you start using technology very

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,970
well your mental patterns are shaped by

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,479
the technology and you start to think

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,250
inside the boundaries of that technology

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,800
so we say it for this role for this

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,470
robot project let's think completely out

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,690
of the box

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,100
and I really I'm it was funny Alec said

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,390
there wasn't the part of the community

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,960
so that doesn't make me feel very young

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:40,820
right now but I was very influenced by

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,800
the Matrix movie and for those of you

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,140
who have seen it there's a scene in

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,660
which neo stands in like a blank screen

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,700
and suddenly from far away there are a

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,320
lot of weapons that come quickly towards

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,690
him and then he's surrounded by like all

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,020
these weapons which somehow for me was

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,390
this endless capabilities and the stools

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,910
and I thought at the time this is

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,940
awesome I so would like to be never like

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,340
have all these tools at my fingertips

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,140
and being able to make whatever I want

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,600
so I was really impressed by that image

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,630
and it really stent lead with me for for

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,780
many years so the tripod project is

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,990
quite simple in fact so if we take away

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,390
the technology and its boundaries

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,460
the idea was with Chris to make a to

00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,710
simulate an experience in which I'm

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,860
speaking with an agent an artificial

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:38,690
intelligence agent and while I would

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:42,950
talk to it or to him he would build for

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:45,350
me my product so I would not only

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,610
describe what I wanted to do as soon as

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,700
he would understand that I want to do

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,960
let's say website with toys for kids he

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,890
would start to ask me questions about

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,200
what kind of toys what age group do you

00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,660
have how many products we have so he

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,610
would start to incorporate all these

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,830
steps that we do on a daily basis when

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,810
we build projects with our customers all

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,440
this knowledge would be incorporated

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,870
into that into that agent and this agent

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,540
would be capable of instantly while

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,950
having the discussion with me

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,960
voice-based

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,890
capable to build for me by the end of

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,390
this half-hour discussion my product so

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,030
we started to just mock-ups all the

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,400
screen and to see how this experience

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,150
would would work and it was quite

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,850
mesmerizing so that was the really first

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,960
part of this of this product and then we

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,090
started to think a bit far and we said

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,130
okay that means we need to have

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,410
obviously some intelligence we're not

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,240
there yet but there is a piece that we

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,750
can start to work on which is the

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,880
automation of the user interface so to

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,800
make it really interesting for us as a

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,240
developers it should be codeless it

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,250
should be platform independent

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,780
thatthat seemed very important it was

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:10,100
and very important it should be

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:15,440
teleporter bone both in code but both

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:19,250
inner hydrated working instance I'm said

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,660
okay that's fine that's let's go for her

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:27,110
what what's the kind of architecture we

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:31,130
needs behind that so we said we should

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,139
base everything on our honor JSON file

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,020
nothing new a lot of companies and

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,700
products Twitter this file this file

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,950
would be what we call the Jason

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,410
intermediary representation that will

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,840
hold all the information the descriptive

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,360
information about this UI and then we

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,690
said in that case once we have this

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,000
descriptor which is a static file we

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,120
would need to have an engine that would

00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,310
in turn be capable of hydrate instantly

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,680
in terms of code on whatever target so

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:08,320
until here nothing new it's not the

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,389
first attempt we were very aware of that

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,940
then we continued to think about the the

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:17,180
needs and we said okay but one of the

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,289
big difficulties is that it's very hard

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,690
to experiment in real time what we're

00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,240
thinking so it was very listening to

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,590
listen mark this morning and say we

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,410
think in design systems and we're

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,970
building tools that allow us to

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,000
synchronize or to shorten the distance

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,650
between the creative moment design

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,070
moment with the production moment or the

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,779
inflating moments of the of the idea so

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,940
we said okay that's fine but we should

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:48,040
not

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,550
only stay at that level we should also

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,890
offer a dev experience as well and we

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,650
should also provide integrations that

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:02,230
can be with any tool that makes design

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:04,930
or prototyping and finally there should

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,980
be an API so that anybody or any third

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,960
party could either build JSON files

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,020
either inject them into our API and

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:19,960
receive on the other hand the code or

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:23,050
the working instance so that sounds very

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,320
good on paper then we started to work on

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,810
it and we had a couple of headaches

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,680
nonetheless I would like to share with

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:37,030
you where we've got and I'm going to

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,950
start a first first video it's going to

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:46,990
be quick and I'll explain after it's a

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:50,320
couple of seconds so I think probably

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:57,160
some of you recognize the lower right

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:59,710
window especially if you're designers so

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,790
in this demo what you see on the on the

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:06,490
on the bottom is a designer experience

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,760
who's working in sketch this is his tool

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,430
it is his universe and I think he's not

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,250
going to leave that universe very soon

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:19,330
so I completely agree with mark on that

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,190
part we should get as close to the habit

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,560
and the way of thinking of each persona

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,360
so by the end of this level basically

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:36,160
we've just built a little piece of the

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:39,490
side of the menu of the gestures so now

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,680
maybe to make it more clear there in the

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,680
right corner have the browser which is

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,010
the hydrated instance of the

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,700
representation then we have the code

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,020
which in this case I think is is react

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,700
but there's a selector that they don't

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,200
see and you could switch to any of the

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,760
other targets depends of your

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,970
preferences

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,470
you have the JSON representation that

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,290
we're talking seriously which is this

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:10,470
descriptive file that will hold all this

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:15,280
information but without any logic and

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:19,090
finally there is sketch so this was the

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,450
first goal that we had in mind is to

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:28,450
make an instant bridge between sketch

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:30,730
and the browser and the code so that's

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,360
quite interesting but the interesting

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,100
part is that we are weeks away to have

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,980
the experience the other way around

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,700
so if you are color and you will work in

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,850
our playground so this is a little demo

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,880
of the playground where two of our

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:53,740
developers are rebuilding the front page

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,540
of the Jesus heroes in real time in real

00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:01,660
time I mean on the same on the same file

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:03,580
so this is collaborative mode if for

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,290
example we would connect we would be on

00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,300
the same project while the developer

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,950
would be coding and making the changes

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,250
in the playground here the designer

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,470
would be having his updates in sketch or

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,780
as a matter of fact in mock-ups or in

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:23,710
Sigma or in whatever other tool that

00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:26,230
allows integrations so the ideas that we

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:30,670
were working on were say okay there are

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,900
some how could I could represent there

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:38,080
some steps that you have to go through

00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,020
in order to go from the design to the

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,240
code and it would be great to collapse

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,150
them so that the oldest the steps

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,830
disappear and you don't do any more

00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,620
anything that is not absolutely required

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,450
as a designer or sort of as a developer

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:57,310
we wanted to create this instant

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:59,290
experience there's a fun fact we did

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,620
this video a couple of times and one was

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,390
always quicker than simple so sorry

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:11,270
simple I know you're here and stuff but

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:14,610
one is the best ok so that's fine some

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:18,690
from an IT perspective we were capable

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:21,290
of reaching our target initial target

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,120
which was to collapse these steps and

00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:27,060
somehow this is the reason I think

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,450
teleport sounded great to teleport the

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:34,290
idea from one step to another in real

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:38,760
time or instantly if possible and then

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:44,850
we started to get into some more stuff

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:46,920
and we said okay that's fine but I don't

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,440
know if that's the same for you I would

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,300
suppose it is the case according to our

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,030
own experience and to a couple

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,940
interviews that we that we spent most of

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,950
the time that you are consuming during

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,790
the day or doing the ordering you're

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:05,730
coding or designing work is lost into

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,610
pixel pushing both on the side of the

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,680
designer and the side of the developer

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,590
you are adjusting things you are doing

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,800
media queries you are doing it better

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:19,170
you optimizing the back you have to take

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,000
care of like the contrast there's all

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,910
these little things that you have to do

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,380
that in fact bring no value to the

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,920
creative process or to the business

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,830
model or to the need of the customer but

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,280
who are in any case needed and you have

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,200
to do them so as developers we just do

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,620
constantly the same thing because we're

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,960
kind of lazy we always build tools that

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,820
makes being better for us we don't want

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,320
to do things twice if most of all this

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,970
when you do it twice the first thing

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
that comes into the mind of developer oh

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,160
can I make a tool that would solve this

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,650
for me so it's a bit of the same process

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,110
but maybe looked from a larger

00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,710
perspective and this time through a

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,080
group of of people not only inside one

00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,600
single population so we started to think

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,410
a bit more about how this would play out

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,840
and we said okay in fact when you're

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,260
building user interfaces it's not just

00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,210
about the design and the implementation

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,520
in fact the complex the the process is

00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,279
much much more complex than that because

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,279
it's a it's the not the sum it's

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,089
a result of the multiplication of the

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,810
interactions of at least five persons or

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:37,139
five let's say personas there's the

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,120
business owner or the stakeholder

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,230
there's the designer who tries to give a

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,180
shape to that idea

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,819
there is the content provider will

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,279
probably write text content that is

00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:50,230
suitable there is the developer

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,850
obviously and there is the market here

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:56,410
and all these guys they starts to

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,879
discuss together and they say ok this is

00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,499
the idea ok I'll design it I'll give it

00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,629
to developer the developer starts to

00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:04,540
come back to stakeholder and then all

00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:07,360
discussion starts to flow around and

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,100
finally we arrive in a moment where it's

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,470
clearly almost a stellar kind of

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,749
discussion and everybody has a piece of

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,769
the information and together in a

00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:28,660
sometimes magmatic kind of process they

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:31,149
start to build user interface so we were

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,889
trying to figure out what is the amount

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:36,309
of decisions that did this group needed

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:38,949
to do and so if you think about it

00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:40,480
they're really an insane amount I'm just

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,699
going to show you a couple of them this

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,220
is from the you you my perspective I

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:49,089
don't know if you guys have checked the

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,470
list of this one it's insane then you

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,959
have obviously all the multi-channel

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,750
aspect of it

00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,519
yes you're friendly obviously the color

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,480
palettes you have to respect everything

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,209
that can be and more and the semantic

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,809
end very soon a new channel that you

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,699
have to fulfill with some things that

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,880
are going to be rather new in the way

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:17,110
you approach things so this is quite a

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,909
complex process and we thought maybe

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,159
there's a way to help this process as

00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:24,250
well oh ok

00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:31,110
so this is a reminder for me I should

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:38,380
open the browser good hello browser

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:43,630
good okay there we are so let me share

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:47,470
this with you okay so we said when

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,820
you're thinking about that in fact there

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,960
are not so many possibilities when you

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:53,850
do interfaces

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:56,620
you never really write text that is

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,600
rotated you don't have blocks all over

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,630
the place there are no crazy things in

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,390
fact they're just a couple of patterns

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,640
that are widely used and they're widely

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,860
used because they're practical for the

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,430
human to to get in in touch with that

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,130
content so we said we should use machine

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:18,310
learning to try to figure out in which

00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,020
context the user is at this moment so we

00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:24,060
build a little plugin that takes any

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:26,200
website and do does what we call

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,580
automatic annotation for machine

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,970
learning so this is the

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:36,659
I think wait let me see for this one

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:39,269
yeah this is one this is reddit okay I'm

00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,929
going to show you github and I'm going

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:45,899
to show you this yours

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:48,389
there's no not a doubt that there's not

00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:50,789
exactly the same pattern from a machine

00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:54,090
learning perspective the fact that the

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:56,489
data is filtered and you have only the

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,360
essence of the boxing and eventually of

00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:02,369
the order in which things are put will

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,139
allow the engine to recognize very

00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:06,450
quickly when as the designer is started

00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:08,609
to draw elements in which kind of

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,259
intention you are do you want to do a

00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:13,470
free call on website do you want to do

00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:17,369
like we said for photographs will be big

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,320
spaces on a lot of images so we started

00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:22,249
to build plugins that apply filters on

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,840
the websites that we are surfing and

00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,399
this plugins are filtering the

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,769
information we would have the weight of

00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:30,929
the text on one side we would have the

00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:33,720
positions of the box on this one on this

00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:37,230
example and we collect other type of

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,909
data like the proportions between the h1

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:44,970
h2 paragraph images line Heights and we

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,940
put everything into a big database and a

00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:51,960
little a little we start to have a sort

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:55,679
of common knowledge about the average of

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,690
best practices when it comes to UI the

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,429
more data we collect the more chances

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,710
are that at the very moment where the

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,440
designer start to put the first items on

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,269
its screen we will know what his

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,879
intention is and then we'll be in a

00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:13,399
decision tree in which we'll be able to

00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:15,299
help him to make this design quicker so

00:20:13,399 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm going to come back to the

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:26,519
presentation now and I would like to

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:29,759
show you a little yeah scenario oh yes

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:33,130
before that important okay take a deep

00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,190
breath this is serious

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,220
this is a bi-dimensional Victoria latent

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:41,830
space I didn't know about that until a

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:46,260
couple of days ago and it took me a days

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,700
of explanation to try to send what it is

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,590
before we just said that we're taking

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,870
these websites and we're analyzing all

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:56,560
these parameters about them all these

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:58,660
parameters cannot be represented into a

00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,640
two dimensional space right because it

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,180
there are multiple parameters so so

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,070
somehow you have to have a formula that

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,820
takes these parameters collapses them

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,280
let's say for the to make it easier

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,920
understand let's say it is a hash of all

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,990
these parameters and this hash by

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,560
another function is represented visually

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,920
for us as humans in two-dimensional

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,650
space so every single point that you

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,260
would see on this picture represents the

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:33,160
analysis of one of the websites that we

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:36,820
are parsing as you can see there are

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:40,480
some conglomerates of websites which I

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,910
would like to translate in by the idea

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,270
that these websites seem to have similar

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,730
patterns so to make it simple probably

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,380
the the central zone which is the most

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,080
lit is probably the most common pattern

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,380
of websites design from the data set

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,420
that we've scanned and the the less

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,730
isolate the more isolated the point is

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,660
then that means is a probably a

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:06,240
particular case so this first phase of

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,220
the of the machine learning work

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,870
transforms the data the visual data or

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,500
the parameters that we put into the

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:17,410
engine into a very concentrated

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:20,080
representation the nice part is that on

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,540
the other hand of this work there will

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,630
be a generator and the generator does an

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,250
unbelievable thing I think it's still

00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:29,380
it's amazing for me I am discovering

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,830
this this part but it opens Umberto

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:36,640
perspectives so if you would put a point

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,700
wherever in this beautiful space the

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,490
system will infer how the design of your

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,770
website should look like by combining

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,919
the weights of the properties of all the

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,960
other data points

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:54,969
so basically you would be able to create

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:58,269
a new item on your site just by having

00:22:54,969 --> 00:23:00,279
the genome of his peers but is never

00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,109
going to be the same as soon as it's not

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,849
a superposition

00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:05,710
you're just saying I want it to be

00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,960
different and this difference is going

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,450
to be a calculated weight between all

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,999
the properties of all the sites that has

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:17,289
been that have been scanned by the

00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:23,589
system there was a had to be considered

00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:25,929
for that I let you recover so now that I

00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:29,609
want a bit for the theory let's see how

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:33,190
this would translate into an experience

00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:37,809
so I'm sorry my design skills are really

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:41,139
really low so please accept my apologies

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:43,809
so let's say somebody enjoys heroes

00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:47,679
wants to make the website and they would

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,469
say okay I'm I want to make a text I

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,879
want to put an image then I need to have

00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:57,729
a button then this image is a logo this

00:23:54,879 --> 00:24:00,580
is the call to action I need to put

00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:07,269
another text this is an interesting part

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:11,729
I put speaker's schedule etc and then I

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:17,909
want a video and let's say I want it to

00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:21,580
be full screen okay so so far so good

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:23,649
but for human it's kind of easy to

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:27,369
understand what this very abstract

00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:29,710
representation are because we we project

00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:32,469
on each of these items all our past

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,929
experience to infer what this means

00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:37,059
right if you never have seen a website

00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,889
before you would have no clue about what

00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,700
this would mean but because we have seen

00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:41,919
so many websites

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,929
it means it's kind of obvious for us in

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:49,229
our language with our semantics that

00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:52,719
this is the website so what would happen

00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:54,940
is the following the engine given all

00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:58,389
the data that it has collected would

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,440
identify that on the top there are five

00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:01,029
items that are

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,789
more or less aligned there are single

00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,980
words and there is a very strong chance

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,940
that the intention of these words were

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:12,850
to be a menu so it will according to its

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,039
data it will replace items to the best

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,070
possible options according to what it

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,370
knows about your intention and then it

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:22,779
continues to scan to add the items

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,820
they're not really aligned and he looks

00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:26,470
in its database or its memory or its

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,690
experience depending how you want to

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:34,090
call it and it will try to find the best

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,950
distribution so yes it is subjective

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,919
because the subjective part of the

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,370
decision that the agent did is based on

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:43,450
its training that's right so if he wants

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,460
you have our decisions you need

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,539
eventually more training but we're gonna

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,549
come to this part too then we're going

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:53,259
to some more advanced for example the

00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,129
engine would know that oftentimes the

00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,769
logo of the company

00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:59,230
this is a semantic part is always used

00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,210
as well as a button to go back on a

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,299
homepage and would automatically infer

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,580
that a small version of the logo should

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,480
be up in the menu because that's what he

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,009
has been trained for so then it will

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,559
compare that with everything he has and

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:21,970
he would hydrate the website with the

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,389
Styles the images the palates the

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,330
spacing of the colors the right contrast

00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:31,509
everything that he knows from his past

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:35,129
experience so basically with this

00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:38,440
machine learning and growing experience

00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:40,720
this agent is going to be capable of

00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,379
making more and more informed decisions

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,460
about your intention so arguably you

00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:50,590
will say okay but I'm not I don't agree

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,720
with him right I want I want something a

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,639
bit different so as a designer you would

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,549
say okay I'm dragging an item from there

00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:59,110
and I'm putting in the middle then he

00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,090
knows that this is a constraint of your

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,000
desire and he recalculates everything

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,100
and all your design again in order to

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,779
respect your desire but respect the best

00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,140
practices that he knows or he has

00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:12,780
observed about that desire

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,670
so this is quite powerful when you think

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,250
about it because if you like me and you

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:20,070
have spent the last four weeks doing a

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,470
website of five pages which I did I

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:27,030
I forgot how complicated it is to look

00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:29,790
at all the little details so it's it's

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:31,890
quite amazing what may I and machine

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:39,270
learning will bring to us in the in the

00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:41,220
next months and years I think the the

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,049
idea is that this process that I

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,169
described in the in the building of user

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:48,419
interfaces is a rather complex process

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:49,980
and there's all these milestones i I

00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:53,309
will like this representation of a

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,590
office of a constellation and each time

00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,559
you want to move from one context to the

00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,840
other as a human you need time you need

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,350
to stop what you're doing you need to go

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,299
into focus mode again it's memory some

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,500
places that you cannot think about right

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,210
if you're designer you're not

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,380
reconsignment security if you're

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,410
developer you don't really care that

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,380
much about content and design so each

00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,750
human is somehow specialized on one or

00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,419
two or three of those items but none of

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,340
us is capable today of being a good

00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,799
performer or a specialist on all of

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,740
those and the more your events in time

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,530
the more the pressure to deliver

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,970
features versus your competitors right

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,360
because not the rest is not with you

00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,160
anymore

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,910
is with your competitors that have this

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:42,809
incredible velocity is going to require

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:45,270
for you to get new tools so the idea

00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:48,530
that we wanted to to achieve and we are

00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:54,720
working hard towards it is to

00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:57,570
step-by-step try to collapse all these

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,990
difficulties or all this knowledge that

00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,150
eventually can be trained or pushed into

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,960
an artificial intelligence in such a way

00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:09,799
that the time spent and the overall

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,860
energy is spent between your idea and

00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:16,799
its realism production diminishes or

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,100
eventually completely collapses in the

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,100
future

00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:32,120
so this night is quite important for me

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,559
it's a talk that is really it's a sorry

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,650
a topic that is related to something

00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,410
very important for us yesterday evening

00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:42,440
Benedict was saying that the web and

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:45,500
HTML especially has been unbelievable

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,390
because it was offering instantly to any

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,820
person that was having a browser the

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,890
knowledge of the person that built that

00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,780
web page I really loved this idea right

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,730
you do this right click and you see the

00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,970
the source of that page and you start to

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:01,610
go for it this was the basic map far far

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,179
before github right this was the first

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,830
open source Act somehow and this open

00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,030
source act is not only an open source

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:12,470
act it's an open protocol Act and

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,710
they're a couple of guys who are talking

00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:18,620
about that some are calling it the web

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,799
3.0 some other guys are calling it the

00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:25,700
third wave and the third wave is

00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:28,730
basically the need for a Renaissance of

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,679
the open protocol and open source of the

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,410
web to give you an example that everyone

00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,549
can understand

00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,870
Facebook is considered by many

00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:39,049
governments as becoming an

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,640
infrastructure right for many countries

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:43,520
that just have accessed internet right

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,350
now Facebook is considered as being the

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,240
internet because they don't know

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,780
anything else about internet but their

00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,360
experience inside the Facebook universe

00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,970
this is not an open protocol mark who

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,380
would just appeared on the previous talk

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,990
knows that if you if you look at the

00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,910
patterns the usage patterns that are

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,200
embedding into Facebook you see that

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,570
they don't want you to get out of

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,030
Facebook so I know about retention in

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,490
products there's no doubt about that it

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,070
is required but that's not about

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:17,540
retention it's about taking over about

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:21,020
the about the digital world so somehow

00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,260
if if I'm looking at things today react

00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:27,400
view angular all these frameworks

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:30,650
they're ways of doing the same thing

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,080
representing an interface and they all

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,720
have good things to propose and they

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,510
need to exist

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,860
what if there would be a JSON format

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,820
that is agnostic

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:45,070
that would describe every interface

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,679
without any constraint about the code or

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,580
the target in which this interface

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,750
should live so we really think that

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,309
we're getting close to there closer to

00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,130
the moment we looked at the sketch files

00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:59,049
sketch is really also an artifact that

00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,480
is unbelievably important for us because

00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:05,620
it's for the first time when a design

00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,470
system exposed its internals and made it

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,230
open source it it's a proposal for a

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,299
protocol a design protocol right the

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,000
file that Mark showed us this morning is

00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:18,700
a file that proposes a way to describe

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,650
user interfaces without impacting or

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,640
making any decision about how we

00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:28,510
developers we would implement it so I

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,570
would I would pledge for us to be more

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:34,630
aware about the open protocols of the

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:36,070
future whatever they would be they could

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,320
be for web but it could be for design

00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,690
possession for code but this is one of

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,970
the dreams that we are having right now

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,100
is to work with other companies or other

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:48,190
guys who are interested by this topic to

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,169
build the basis of a new protocol that

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,929
would define user interfaces in a world

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:56,409
in which this user interfaces will be in

00:32:52,929 --> 00:33:01,740
my opinion quite sure being automated

00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:10,390
very very soon and I heard this last

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:15,070
thought with you technology in the last

00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:17,409
years has really surpassed in many ways

00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,559
humans capability I think the raise of

00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:22,570
the eye we all know it we maybe not

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,150
accept it but somehow we are thinking

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:29,789
about that will surpass our capabilities

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,320
so it is very important for us to

00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:34,750
eventually determine what it would help

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,480
us to do and the way I'd like to look at

00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:40,299
things is to say that AI is going to be

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,000
this mental exoskeleton that will allow

00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:45,730
us to focus on which problem we want to

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,470
choose in the future and not the details

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,530
about how you would like to solve it so

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,420
yes they will be in

00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,900
that will have that will work on making

00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,340
it to sub errors they will improve the

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,420
whole thing forward they will do things

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:02,000
that AI can does can do sorry but

00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:05,320
overall most of us most of us humans in

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,970
the years to come in my opinion again

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,590
will benefit of this metal exoskeleton

00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:14,179
and they'll be very augmented in

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:16,730
whatever their activities are I guess

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:20,170
that will be it Thanks

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,170
[Applause]
