00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:25,500
welcome to Jays heroes 2018 ok I I will

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,470
be honest I did not have a single slots

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,929
to rehearse this intro talk because last

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,410
night at 2 a.m. we were sorting socks in

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,860
the hallway so this might be a bit shaky

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,020
but anyway bear with me I got this year

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:47,070
the inglorious task of in entertaining

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,960
you before the the proper speakers

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,210
actually gets the stage and actually do

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,300
the technical talks so I'm here to talk

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,789
a bit about Jays heroes about this

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,690
year's conference to talk about our

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:07,619
community and what we do here and I want

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:11,130
to start on a personal note I - to talk

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,290
a bit about what what I think is the the

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,689
main reason why why we do a conference

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,170
or why I personally like going to

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,729
conferences and and why I also enjoy

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,220
spending my time in organizing a

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:28,829
conference and I have a couple of good

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:30,900
friends who actually told me at some

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,200
point and they they repeated they told

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,990
me that like they don't understand why

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,000
they should go to conferences because

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,590
you get to see technical talks which you

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,840
can see online you you see like it's

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,780
it's it doesn't really make sense to

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,820
spend two days of your of your holiday

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,409
or to spend two days of your weekend to

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,240
attend the conference because everything

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,890
is online now all the resources all the

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,770
information is there you don't learn

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,360
much by going to conferences but I think

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,840
that going to conferences is not about

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,909
learning is actually about interaction

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,660
it's about meeting the people who are

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,569
behind the the frameworks the meeting

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,480
the people who are behind the languages

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,760
and the technology

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,549
we are using and this is what we try to

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,760
facilitate as a conference to gather

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,799
everyone in the same room to to interact

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,040
to foster interaction and collaboration

00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:29,680
between people coming from all over the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,190
world speakers coming from different

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,390
continents from halfway around the world

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,819
attendees coming from all over Europe so

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,140
that's for me that's the main reason why

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:45,910
why I go to conferences and why I sort

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,200
of like advocate towards going to

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,470
conferences not because you're learning

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,400
some hard things but because you you get

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,790
your your senses let's say your your

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,709
whole your whole experience is enriched

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,870
with all the other all the great

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:06,250
interaction that you that you can do at

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,410
the conference and our main theme for

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,690
2018 is real heroes don't have

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,280
superpowers this is something that came

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,660
up during last year's conference and we

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,930
what we want to emphasize here is that

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,980
you don't need to be a rockstar

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,620
developer a superstar in order to to be

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:30,099
a hero in order to actually help someone

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,880
being a hero is something that all of us

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,889
can do at any point through any kind of

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,450
interaction to any kind of support that

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,120
we give to someone ment through

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,889
mentoring through coaching through

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,410
helping out on projects whether it's

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,870
open source or not we strongly believe

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,970
that everyone can be a hero

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,160
and you yeah that's that's them that's

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:55,329
the main that's the main goal to show

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:58,450
that the people who some of us think are

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,099
actually the superheroes of our our

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,319
ecosystem are actually people like us

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:06,549
they have the same problems as as we

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,769
have and we just we can just work

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:14,519
together we can actually do a lot of

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:20,260
cool things together and back now to my

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:23,530
loop back to our mission as a conference

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,810
we we are when we started doing J's

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,250
heroes which is not a long time ago it's

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,490
actually not even a year since

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:34,000
we organized the first conference we set

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,700
up to do three things to offer some sort

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,640
of different event to the local

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:46,050
community we saw a lot of similar events

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:51,280
happening here which all had the same

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,780
the same let's say characteristics and

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,610
we wanted to do things differently we

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,590
wanted to have a singletrack conference

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,330
because we strongly believe is the best

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,710
format that you can offer to attendees

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,350
and to speakers we we wanted to to bring

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,660
a lot of speakers from the international

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,030
community who are here for these days

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,680
who are here inclusion are here to to to

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:19,150
interact and to talk with the community

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:21,490
and basically we want to say okay we are

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,470
here in Cluj we have a very nice very

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,810
friendly JavaScript community and we

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,060
want to put this on the map or I want to

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,610
say we want for someone coming from

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,130
outside to say yeah that's really that's

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,410
a really cool City they do a lot of fun

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,710
stuff with JavaScript and finally we

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,390
wanted to put all our efforts everything

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,260
that we do everything that we put into

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:47,740
the conference we want to to put this

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,360
into basically put it back towards the

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,470
community to help the local ecosystem

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,330
with this and our model for community

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,180
for for the for the conference is that

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,220
it's a non-profit event was created by

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,890
volunteers from the community so not a

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,080
single person that worked for making

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,470
this happen got paid in any way or will

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,800
get paid in any way we are open and

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:15,280
transparent we put all the details

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,729
publicly through medium posts all about

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,290
how many how much money we need for for

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,150
the budget for the conference we also

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,300
have a transparency report at the end of

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,130
each conference in which we show where

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,660
did those work where did the money go

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,229
actually the money that we got from the

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,240
tickets and from the sponsors and

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:37,810
finally speaking of sponsors we think

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,390
that a simple sponsoring package that

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,200
doesn't include a company booth and

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,120
doesn't does

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,220
bring anything from the realm of

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,980
recruitment and sales into the

00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,900
conference is a better model because it

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,370
focuses on the companies that are

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,690
actually understand the mission and the

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:58,720
mission is that we grow together and we

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:03,400
we folk we center around the community

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,950
every all our efforts of growth last

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,380
year was the first addition as I

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,020
mentioned we had a lot of fun here we

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,940
still have the letters that we had a

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,530
workshop for and we manually actually

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:21,340
crafted all those letters and a few

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:24,070
facts about last year we had 450

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:30,370
attendees this way year we're expecting

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:32,860
more than 600 we had 18 speakers and

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,170
this year including the workshops we

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,560
have 29 people doing other workshops or

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:42,940
speaking at the conference and we see a

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,920
very big very big increase in in the

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,360
interest for the conference so we really

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,080
really like that and we would like to

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,760
thank you all for for joining us today

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,810
one thing which for me was also

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,740
important as a as a conclusion from from

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,500
2017 was that we we managed to form

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,410
relationships professional relationships

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:10,480
between people and we have two accounts

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,670
of of speakers or attendees that after

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,530
Jays Heroes work together or some sort

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,720
of open source projects that was really

00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:20,200
cool that was something that really made

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,630
us think that this is actually one of

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,490
our domain things that we can actually

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,680
facilitate through this conference get

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,360
people together so that they can form

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,370
these kind of professional relationships

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,130
and they can continue after the

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,890
conference so a few facts about this

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,410
year compared to last year

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,680
like I mentioned 600 attendees coming

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,180
from over 30 countries I briefly counted

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,790
we have actually no idea how many

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:52,960
countries we have here 29 speakers who

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,970
are coming from the the almost the edges

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,850
of the world when when we

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,980
when we consider Europe we have people

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,460
coming from Australia from India from

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,500
Pakistan from the United States Canada

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,790
all over Europe we'd like to thank you

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,230
all

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:14,200
we got 140 proposals during our call for

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:18,460
paper session which I think was three

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,740
months it was open for three months and

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:27,160
we had a very tough choice

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:31,330
to pick about 11 or 12 out of those 140

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:35,170
proposals that was a there was a huge

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:38,770
difference compared to last year we are

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:41,080
a group of 15 organizers who like I said

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,200
dedicate their free time to make this

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:49,470
happen and it's roughly about nine

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,470
months of work so thank you

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,040
so it'sit's nine months of work which

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,850
actually so the work actually started as

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,550
soon as J zeros 2017 ended which was in

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,400
June so yeah I hope hopefully this year

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,720
we have at least three months of a free

00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,900
time after this hopefully we have a lot

00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,240
a few interesting programs running this

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,970
year we we had as the same as last year

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,810
diversity tickets in which we offered

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,250
the opportunity for someone to buy

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,670
basically one plus one ticket and then

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,150
we offer that that tickets to to someone

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,610
from underrepresented groups and we had

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,950
a good bunch of diversity ticket bought

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,870
this year so thank you guys for every

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,550
for for for everyone who bought that

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,910
really appreciate it and to let you know

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,890
as I don't have the exact number but the

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,720
exact number of tickets that were bought

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,030
we have the exact number of people here

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,130
invited through those tickets we also

00:10:53,030 --> 00:11:00,200
have a program called adopted JavaScript

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:01,970
er so we facilitate for people coming

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,220
from outside Cluj we help them find

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,840
accomodation it's sort of a couchsurfing

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:11,900
program but for gigs and we hope that

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:15,650
the the pairs that will form have some

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:17,330
some good time together and hopefully we

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:20,870
will see some some pictures on social

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:24,320
media about the the good times people

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,150
had together during this program one

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,080
final note or two final notes actually

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,090
we have we had a budget of around 18,000

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,100
euros for the for the whole conference

00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:39,350
and approximately this is again a very

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,200
rough estimation but it's way it's

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,680
definitely over 1,000 works what are the

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,370
hours of volunteer work put behind

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,980
behind this a few things you can do or

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,890
we encourage you to do first of all you

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,830
encourage you to join the slack channel

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,390
where almost all of the speakers are are

00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,030
there already you can already start

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,340
interacting with people there we can we

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,560
have different channels we we've seen a

00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,470
lot of activity there I think there are

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,620
almost 200 people by now on the slack

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,779
Channel we will try to use the slack

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,100
channel also to to help with other

00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:25,970
initiatives around the conference but I

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:30,050
will briefly touch them a bit later then

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:32,180
we use a slide though for asking

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,220
questions during the talks so except for

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,680
this one I'm not going to answer any

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:41,649
questions after this one all the

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,899

will be able to to ask questions there

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,600
to upvote them and at the end of the

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:58,670
talk the speaker will will take the most

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,069
most voted questions and we'll answer

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,220

00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:11,720
we also have both the slack and the

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:14,720
slide on information on some printing

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,410
papers in the hallway so if you need to

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,629
find them

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,100
I either search for them or you can ask

00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:24,500
one of the volunteers and they will

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,250
direct you to the papers then we have a

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,350

sketches for the third edition of

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:06,319
eloquent JavaScript so we had the

00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:13,910
JavaScript community sort of like

00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:17,449
brought us together so yeah you will see

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,670
those will see these sketches also on on

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,240
social media we will try to share them

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,310
as soon as

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,500

retweet them share them on whatever

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,480
social media platform you use because

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:35,510
because it's it's something that we

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:42,529
would like to spread from the con from

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:44,060
the conference as a Content a few points

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,560
about what we can do in the hallway

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,279
because you've seen maybe a lot of stuff

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,410
here we have a lost-and-found

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,120
desk next to the registration if you

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,980
lose something go there if you found

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,380
something go there it's easy if you lose

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,209
if you lost something in 2017 I think

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:05,570
you can go there and probably the stuff

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:08,390
is there we have a the the far most

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:12,050
corner there is the the the refreshing

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:15,649
area refreshment area house recharging

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:19,790
yeah you'll find there ice-cream water

a bunch of stickers then we have the

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:42,170
tech point where we have we hope to get

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,720
some interesting conversations spinning

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,810
off on whether which framework is the

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,930
best yeah that always is a fun a fun

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,700
conversation to start then we have the

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,160
open source point and I want to I want

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,570
to focus on this a bit because we really

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,149
want your attention on this we have a

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:06,670
bunch of open source projects we have a

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:11,480
bunch of people at at J's heroes who are

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:13,880
who created amazing open source projects

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,290
who are core contributors or maintainer

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,540
of projects and we will offer we added

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,230
there a board which is called the open

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:27,500
source job board people that have open

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,660
source projects will ask for help there

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,540
maybe they need help maintaining a

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,160
project maybe they need help just with

00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,839
some contributions some pork

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,670
or maybe they need help documenting the

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,019
project and whoever is interested in

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,480
helping out whoever's interesting he may

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:46,850
be learning or making their first steps

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,420
into open-source a lot of people will be

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,629
there during the during the day and

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,649
we'll help you out we really wish to to

00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:58,670
get something started here to help these

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,819
amazing people who dedicate their time

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,010
to to build these open-source projects

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:05,510
to also have the possibility to to gain

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:10,069
something from from attending the

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:13,069
conference finally we have the oops

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,130
sorry so this one we have the the

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:20,179
feedback corner which is right next to

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,400
the door we have a bunch of envelopes on

00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,199
the wall with where you can send

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,419
messages feedback messages to the

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,890
speakers we encourage you to do that and

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:33,230
we have a couple some some boxes there

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,870
one boxes for feedback for us and

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:40,220
another box is what we call a Santa box

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,080
in which we want you to imagine who

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,730
would you like to see at J's heroes in

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,919
2019 then we have the memory point here

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:52,419
on the left where you can take a photo

00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:56,169
and goof around with a lot of props and

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:59,270
finally the merchandising giveaway area

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:02,539
which I think it's pretty it's pretty

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,900
clear I will actually touch on a bit

00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:09,409
more now on on the open source project

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,960
sorry here because I forgot to mention

00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:16,640
that so we have a couple of projects a

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,530
couple of people here who will be there

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,530
definitely and who would like to get

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,169
some interaction on their projects if

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,480
this year with code sandbox he will

00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,919
he'll definitely I'm not sure he's here

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,230
now

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,600
he will definitely want to to get some

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,220
interaction on code sandbox

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,750
Sebastian and Alex Japan are here also

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:40,010
creators of NOx and they want also to

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,340
interact with people at the open source

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:47,160
point we have your notes from let's do

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,840
it Romania is one of the

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,510
of the of the program and they have a

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,280
very nice open source app written

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:58,980
written in react that react native is

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,960
used by millions of volunteers around

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,630
the world for the let's do it

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,840
cleanup programs and finally we have us

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:09,440
as the J's Heroes website that's open

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,910
source it's on github and we really want

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,450
really need help on that if you if you

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,640
wish to to join and how would that the

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,640
whole everything the website that you

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,570
ditch is so the website that it is still

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,450
on for for the heroes everything is open

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:30,000
source and everything was built through

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,970
tiny contributions for from our from our

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,340
members and it's a fun fact for example

00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,370
communities like the communities from

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,080
Bucharest and and Timmy Shar were asked

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,080
to actually do pull requests to add

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,180
their logos to the to the website so we

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,430
try to continue this trend and maybe

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:51,180
next year we'll ask the speakers to pull

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:54,810
request their info once they get at the

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,630
conference finally one point on the

00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:59,520
merchandise all the money that you

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,500
donate there at the merchandise point

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,220
where you can get anything from t-shirts

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:08,400
to bags to socks ear socks that's the

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:12,530
most important one and for from someone

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,690
who wears unmatching socks usually I

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,040
kindly advise you to try and mix maybe

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,580
the sauce because you get a better

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,990
better effect on the long run we have a

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,370
couple of initiatives that want to

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,030
support with all the money that we get

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:30,090
from that point one is we want to start

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,640
operating on a more frequent base note

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,440
school workshops in inclusion where we

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,820
teach people the basics of JavaScript

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,560
and the other one is we want to help

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,140
open source projects through open

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,090

basically thank you and now I have one

00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:46,240
one final thing to to mention we started

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:51,549
as as exclusiva scripters this is the

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,530
the local community here and all all of

00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,840
the people and all of the people that

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:59,080
are making this happen at the moment are

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,630
indeed part of Clue JavaScript ours but

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,360
even from the first few months of the

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,679
community and even from from before J's

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:11,559
heroes we already had people in our

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:17,110
community that were not from Cruz we had

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:19,240
a lot of speakers who came include at

00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,090
some point speakers who came dead to J's

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,429
heroes 2017 and they basically from that

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,289
point on they were part of our community

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:30,250
and at this point we feel that the

00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:33,340
community grows a bit beyond our city we

00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,630
are we are no longer tied to to just a

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,870
single city we are truly on

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:40,210
international community so that being

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:44,080
said I'd like to announce that starting

00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:46,900
today crew JavaScript ours is turning

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,669
into the J's Heroes community in order

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,240
to reflect the fact that we are no

00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:51,340
longer

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,300
title to the city we are as an

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,130
international community and we want to

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,140
have jazz heroes as an umbrella

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:01,450
community on top of all the initiatives

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:04,030
that we do with this amazing group of

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:05,710
people that we have and this includes

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,720
the meetups that we do on a regular

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,750
basis every two weeks every three weeks

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,450
on there in various parts of the city

00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:17,260
this includes the conference that that

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:19,030

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,330
to Paul which we will definitely do for

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:26,170
at least ten editions and then we will

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:28,300
figure out what to do from there but

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:32,110
it's also about things like note school

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:35,020
and other educational initiatives that

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,300
