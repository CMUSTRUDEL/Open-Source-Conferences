Publication date: 2021-03-05
Playlist: JSHeroes Meetups 2021
Description: 
	After an unforgettable 2020, let's have a chat and see what you expect from 2021 in web development (mainly JavaScript Ecosystem).

This will be an open talk so anyone can contribute, but if you just want to sit back and listen that is ok too.

Some of the topics that we might debate are:

- what frameworks will be popular
- what to expect from the job market
- will TypeScript be the default choice when you start a project in 2021?
- what new libraries/tool should we have a look in 2021 (ex. Cypress a few years back)
...and many more.
