Description: 
	The tech industry is dominated by men. As a woman engineering leader, I always wanted to have more women engineers and managers working in my team. But somehow we weren’t hiring a lot and the answer that I was receiving is that they’re not passing our interviews.

We ran due diligence to find out where they were failing during the interview process.

I will share our findings and the measures that we took to enable their success.
