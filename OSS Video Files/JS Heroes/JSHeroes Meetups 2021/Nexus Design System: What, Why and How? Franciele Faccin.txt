Publication date: 2021-05-13
Playlist: JSHeroes Meetups 2021
Description: 
	What is a Design System?
Why is it important?
How did we build one? Well, actually we built 2…

In this talk I’ll share the learnings of how we created a Design System for the Motors products at OLX, and what we learned in the process when we moved from that to Nexus, a shared Design System with OLX classifieds.

	00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
so today

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,200
what i'm going to present to you is um

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,719
i'll be talking a little bit about nexus

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,080
which is our design system here

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,720
at alex i'm a front-end developer

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,840
i work at alex for two years now in the

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
motors vertical

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,480
which is focused on on

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,599
car and car parts classifieds

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,239
and and we are presenting in many

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,680
countries

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:41,840
and um in romania poland and portugal

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,440

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,080
and uh before starting the the slides i

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,119
just want to thank everybody for being

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
here today

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,799
uh for some of us we are finishing the

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
day if you are in romania

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
uh for others like the ones that are

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,400
here in lisbon

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,000
it's still 4 30 in the afternoon so

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,360
thank you for taking our coffee break

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
here with us today

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,759
and watching this presentation

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,840
uh and i want to start with a small

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
story

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,200
so because about one year ago it was

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,600
january last year

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,159
we were hosting a meet up in our offices

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
and you remember this before times when

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
we used to gather in closed

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,159
spaces and sit right next to each other

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,240
uh those glorious times and

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
and here we had this meet up and i had

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
the opportunity

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
to to be talking about the motors design

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
system that we had developed

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
had developed for the motors vertical

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,119
and at the end of the talk

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,439
someone asked me um so

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
is this for motors only or is this a

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
shared design system between other

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,759
products in the company

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
and my answer at the time was no not yet

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
but today i can happily say that we are

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
sharing a design system

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
with other products that relax and in

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
the space we learned a lot of things and

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,879
today i'm here to share that with you

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,599
so today what will be presenting some

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,480
main concepts of what is a design system

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,640
uh i will also be presenting why is a

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,640
design system relevant to us

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
and how we build one the tools that we

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,160
use the experience

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
that we gather in building this shared

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
design system with the

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,760
within the company and hopefully you can

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
take some insights

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,959
on how and maybe even start working on

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,319
your own so

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,599
let's go so first things first what is a

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,720
design system

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,560
so a design systems are a collection of

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,400
rules constraints and principles

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
implemented in design and code

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,800
it's much more than just a style guide

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,760
it's a set of guidelines of what to use

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
where to use

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
when and how to use it it's a way to

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
know what

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
should or shouldn't be done to keep

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
consistency on our platforms and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
products it should contain everything

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
from colors typography spacing

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
everything you name it it provides

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,040
consistent robust design patterns that

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,440
can benefit many things

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
and ultimately a design system is a

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
product that is serving other products

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
and it

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,400
should be treated as such and

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,319
why is it important uh a design system

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
is important because it helps us to have

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,799
a coherent experience

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,959
across all locations and platforms

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
here in motors we focus on cars and car

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,120
parks classifieds like i mentioned

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
before

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
and we are present in poland with

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,599
automotive romania with alto vitru and

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,760
in portugal withstand virtual

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,360
and we have millions of people visiting

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
our platforms every month and

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
millions of ads available and we have

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,640
many people working these platforms at

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,480
the same time

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
and we want to keep consistency on what

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,599
we do a design system will help us

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
determine the way that basic elements

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,200
talk to each other

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
and help us create more complex layouts

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
on top of that

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,760
and the design system also help us make

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,239
the experience consistent

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
but it's funny because so this

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,479
presentation now is an adaptation of

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,840
that one that i presented last year

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,320
and i used this slide to to help uh show

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,560
consistency between products but

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
actually really if we look closely

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
uh we start seeing some inconsistencies

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
because we are not

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,759
using a design system still at this

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,600
point we can see that for example the

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,160
primary link caller

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,240
in one brand is different than the other

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
uh the placeholders is a

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,240
subtle gray in one place and it's in

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,240
its black like regular text in others so

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,680
there's a lot of small inconsistencies

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
the spacing is different

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,639
in the websites so this is an example

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,210
of small things that can happen and some

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,440
small adjustments that can happen

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,520
[Music]

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,840
in your product and then that is not

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
replicated in other places

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
but now i'm glad to show you that since

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
then

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
this page has been redesigned and

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,759
implemented with using the motors design

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,960
system

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,720
and this is a super better experience

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
the visual language is now the same the

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
visual cues are the same

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,800
you look at it and you know it's the

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,440
same brand behind it

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
a design system will also help you focus

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
on the real problems

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
uh both designers and developers will

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
know the rules and guidelines of the

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
design system so instead of taking time

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
thinking of what is the button for this

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
call to action what what

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
font size should i use the right button

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
and the right typography

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
will be already specified in the design

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
system

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,400
a design system also creates a common

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,479
language so designers and developers can

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
more easily discuss ideas and projects

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
among themselves

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,520
we are on the same page and gaps in

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
communication are greatly reduced

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
because of this and then now for the

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
developers here

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,160
i have a question for you do you have a

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
folder that looks like this

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
it's a folder with shared visual

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
elements in your project

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,360
but then you are going to develop

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
something and you look at the list and

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
it's like

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,120
what is an informative what is why do we

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,479
have a button and then an arrow button

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
how are they are different

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,000
when do i use those how do they even

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
look like

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
so enters the design system and this is

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
another great benefit

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,759
although a design system is not just

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,880
about the visual elements

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,000
almost always you end up developing a

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
visual compo

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
visual styles and components library

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
that's going to be documented and

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,560
released as reusable codes for

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
developers

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
and symbols ready for use for the

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
designers

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
and these will lead you to a cleaner

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,199
code base

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,560
and okay but how do we really do it

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,199
so before i enter in the how details i

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
have a little bit of story time for you

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
so

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,759
our platform is built on on a framework

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,919
an internal framework called atlas and

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
although atlas has bravely served its

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,039
purpose through many years

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
we are now in the process of migrating

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,759
parts of the system to more appropriate

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
technologies and one of these steps is

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
decoupling the front end

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,000
from it and migrating to react and we

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,599
wanted all of those things that i

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
mentioned before we wanted the more

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,240
coherent experience when we were doing

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
that

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,160
we wanted to also be able to focus on

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,919
the real problems we wanted to be able

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,120
to communicate between designers and

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,199
developers better

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
and we wanted to have a cleaner code

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
base with reusable components that were

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
easy to use

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,080
so we went on our merry way and we

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,599
created ignition

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,240
a design system for the motors vertical

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,400
uh and after a few months of collective

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,599
hard work of the designers and from the

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,240
developers we we started using it in our

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,400
products

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
it was not perfect we still had a long

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,080
way to go

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,759
but it was our baby and we are very

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
proud of it

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
but this presentation is not called the

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
ignition design system

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
it's also not called motors design

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
system anymore

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
so you can guess that things have

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,639
changed since then so one day

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
there was this message in our design

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
system channel and ultimately it said

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
uh the design team sees an opportunity

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
to connect the new design

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
system for alex rebranded and the motors

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,360
design system

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,879
so you see that while we were creating

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
our own design system

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,599
wallex was doing some renovations some

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
rebranding on their websites

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
and the nolex design system was born out

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,959
of this

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,880
and the designer saw the opportunity to

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,919
join forces and connect the work that

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,320
we've done so far

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
with the design system created for for

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,640
design for rolex

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
and with this we would strengthen even

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,920
more the coherent experience

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
aspect of the design system we are not

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,160
only

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
talking right now about sheriff's

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
experience inside a single product

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
anymore

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
but across multiple products and

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
brandings inside the company so

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,440
this made a lot of sense to us and

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,600
another thing that happened is that the

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
designers at rolex had already created

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
their own design system library

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
with visual components so we had a

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,000
choice to make between adapting our

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,399
existing design system

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,720
to match the the new guidelines or adopt

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
their design systems and help

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
adjust it to to be shared between

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
multiple products

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
and it was a little bit of a tough

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
choice but in the end it made more sense

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
to

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
be using the shared design system the

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,240
shared library

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,200
and as it was a little bit more mature

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
than ours

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,920
and it was closer to the final idea that

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,880
we wanted for the design system

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
and thus was born the unified design

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,800
system

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,160
uh but that's a mouthful am i right so

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,720
we started some pose

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
for defining the name of the new design

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,880
system

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,560
and blend was a close contestant

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,720
but we would blend

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
and no we don't didn't want that the

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
joke as well

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,839
so we we changed the name and

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
we went with the other winner the real

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,720
winner which was nexus

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,079
and nexus means connection means

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
a connection between things or a

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,240
connected series or group so this

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,040
was the perfect name to symbolize the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,320
connection between our products

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,240
and now really how did we do it so

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
now that i gave you a little bit of

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,760
backstory on our

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,200
history so far so here

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,120
are the things that we learned after

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,360
working on two different design systems

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
so the first thing that we need to do

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,800
when working

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
and starting a new design system i

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
believe is defining

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,320
the methodology and a common language

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
for the design system

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
because the design system won't create

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,560
itself and

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,800
so i recommend studying and

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
discussing with designers and developers

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
what is the best language

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,920
that will work for you the first

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,800
instinct

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
of many people is to adopt atomic design

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
by bread frost

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
but the thing is that it's really hard

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,680
to apply it

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,800
to web development there is a really

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
good talk from

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,200
cristiano rostelli of badoon where he

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
expressed this

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,360
atoms and molecules can even make sense

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,839
on web development

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,320
but when you get to templates and pages

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,440
how do you define a template and

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,519
pages are not that static anymore you

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,480
you have a page you click on something

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
something else

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
will load on the page is it still the

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,360
same page is it a new page

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,640
no it's it's a living thing and and i

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
agree with him

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,600
um and actually even to me even atoms

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
and molecules are a little bit hard to

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
define

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
because for example if you have a button

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
is a button an atom

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
is a check box an atom but then is the

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
label

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,839
texting the in the checkbox on atom2 so

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,160
are we talking about a molecule

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,839
you can start to get real philosophical

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639
real fast with this

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
so what i recommend is let's keep it

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
simple

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,560
all things are tokens and components

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
after working these two different design

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,399
systems following this methodology i can

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,839
say that the communication is

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,720
way simpler this way between engineers

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,440
designers and even product people

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
it's simple and efficient it's straight

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
to the point

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,600
and of course keep in mind atomic design

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
and the composition that it teaches

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,160
but in the end we are really dealing

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,079
only with tokens and components

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,519
and some components are simpler some are

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,000
more complex

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,440
but in the end it's just components and

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,720
we are going to discuss components in

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,839
more details in a bit

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,200
but first i want to talk with tokens

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,279
um i want to talk about tokens because

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
it will be the foundation of your design

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,160
system

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
and as someone who had to work on

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,959
redoing all the tokens

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
on the new design system and as someone

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,600
who

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,519
kind of became the token police herself

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,639
i can be very passionate about this

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,920
topic

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,920
so let's dive in

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,680
tokens help us solving solving the

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,440
problems

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
of dealing with the many many options

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,240
that a design system can offer

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,000
so a design system will always have many

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
different values for the many different

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,959
properties that we have we have many

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,000
colors spaces

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,760
sizes typography you name it so

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
you can solve some of these problems

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
with variables

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,519
and variables names so for example for

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,720
colors we can have

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,440
blue one we can have blue2 and etc

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,160
but the variables are only taking out

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,399
the mystery out of obscure values

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,320
but they don't bridge the gap between

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
naming and usage

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,040
so they answer what options do i have

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,519
but they leave out what choices do i

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,639
make

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,360
unclear so

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,199
but a design system strength comes from

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,639
knowing how to apply options to the

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,760
right context

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
so instead of thinking if grade 3 or

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
grade 4

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
is the right zone for a border if we

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
have tokens

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,040
if we have tokens in place you can now

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,000
use the token border medium primary for

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,399
example and you don't have

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,680
to worry about the final value anymore

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
because you're thinking about the

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
meaning and the decision that is already

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,880
taken

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
so in the end tokens are decisions that

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,639
are propagating through a design system

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,959
and they are adding meaning to these

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,720
obscure values

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
and now we have decisions that we can

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
use with confidence and propagates for

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,800
products

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,000
and to create tokens that that will have

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,639
to come from you

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,639
and what is best for you to define you

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
can start with colors and typography

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,279
which makes more sense at the beginning

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,560
but but soon you see what else could

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,760
also benefit from having a token

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,320
and here looking a little bit of a code

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,000
finally so here we have the current

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,120
tokens that we are using

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,800
in simple terms we are using it as uh as

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,959
a theme inside the project

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,839
and the tokens are the the variables

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
names

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,480
uh having tokens are defined or at least

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,880
having a clear structure that will allow

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
you

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,639
to expand in the future can help a lot

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
in the long run

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,560
and it's especially important when your

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,000
design system will be used by multiple

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,240
products like ours

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
so like some motors can have very

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,959
different branding

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,880
so that even even then

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,440
using the shared design system uh won't

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
want to block them on that so the names

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,040
that

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,800
so components won't have names like blue

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,920
five which is the primary color for

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,959
mothers

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,000
and and but meanwhile

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,839
like the primary color is charcoal so we

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
are not using names anymore we are using

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
tokens so now we have the primary color

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,920
of prime

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,000
background global primary for example so

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,199
we abstract the values into their

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
meanings

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,680
and then later each brand can just

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
provide the values that makes more sense

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,320
to them

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
and since we're using them based on the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,000
meanings on the components it will

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
automatically translate to the right

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
places

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,880
and in the code we can consume these

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
tokens for example if you are using

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,320
react like us

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,639
with the theme provider here we have a

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,399
snippet for the providers for motors

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,880
and olex team but we can also expose the

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
theme

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
object so you can import the theme

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,600
directly and consume it

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,920
as you wish in our case we are consuming

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,720
it

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,720
and using in css engineers in styles

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,880
and okay now that we are all token

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
experts we can

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,279
start talking about components so

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
related with components

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
we have worked with two different

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,000
approaches

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,720
so on ignition the motors only design

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
system

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
we started using reactances and that

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
decision was made

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,519
because we wanted to have pure html

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
components that could also be used on

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,839
legacy

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,319
code and then we could use the same css

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,720
for react components

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,520
and one strategy that we adopted was

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
that

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,520
one component would hold all the

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,600
variants

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,880
of that that single component so for

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
example a button

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,959
has many variations and it was all

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,440
implemented in the same components

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,760
which made it real simple to use the

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
consumer would only have to load one

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
button

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,280
and then we can import it and just pass

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,280
the prop of the type that you want

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,880
and voila we have a primary button

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,679
but we because we had only

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
one single component holding all of the

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,640
variants that you can have

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,559
uh it can that end up leading with you

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
shipping a lot of codes to your clients

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,400
that you don't really need

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
because even if you only needed one

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,120
variation

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
of this button you are still shipping to

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,960
your to your clients

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
the code for dealing with all the other

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,440
variations inside your codes

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,600
so you are increasing your bundling even

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,000
if you like it or not

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,840
now nexus the shared design system was

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
built differently and i quite prefer

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,760
this approach a lot more

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,400
so we have something similar to what

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,679
airbnb did in their design system if you

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
are familiar with it or

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,480
if not you can check it out it's there

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,480
is a very good talk from them

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,400
so here we have a base component for

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,520
example a base button

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,520
and this base component will hold all of

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
the minimum common stylings and the

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,440
medium information for what a button

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
requires

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
and then its only purpose is to be

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
extended

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,480
by other buttons and create each

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,559
variation

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,320
so now if we wanted to to only use the

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,160
primary button we would only be

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,400
importing that variation

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,440
and we can have as many other types of

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,280
buttons that we need

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,280
and the final client wouldn't even know

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,919
about it at least their bundle size

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,360
definitely

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,400
won't know about it this means that we

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,919
are going to have a lot more files

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,919
since you're not only but now you're

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,799
only getting the code relevant to the

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,520
button that you're using

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,600
and translating this to code nexus uses

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,640
typescript react motion and styled

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
system

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
and here we have some snippets of the

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,679
base

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,280
button component and it's setting the

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,400
base styles and

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
settings for uh for a common button in

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,360
general

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
so like it's doing things like text

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,360
positioning typography

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,640
how to deal with icons basic stuff

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,400
and then uh if i want to implement for

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,960
example secondary button

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
it extends the stylings for the for the

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
button base

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
and then implements its own styles on

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
top of it

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,760
so now when consuming we are going to

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,400
import just that button that we need and

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,960
just that

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
code that we need and nothing else you

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,080
won't be shipping nothing else to the

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,480
clients and all those

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,280
other dozens of buttons variations will

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
be left behind

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,559
and how do we develop these beauties

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,440
in general so here more or less the

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,080
steps of our component development

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,640
we currently have a governance team and

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,200
that helps keeping the house in order

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,200
uh some are working on it half of their

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,840
time so for example we have a product

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,760
manager

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
and a designer that are dedicating a lot

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,159
of their time to to the library

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
and although they're not there full time

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
it certainly feels like they are

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,159
because they're super proactive and and

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
responsive

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,679
and we finally have a full-time

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
front-end engineer

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,880
that is going to start soon working

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,800
dedicated in the design system

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,080
that is hearing the call hi demons

00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,640
[Laughter]

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,960
but also we have some volunteers like me

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,919
and other front-end engineers

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
from molex and and motors that take some

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,919
time

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,240
that they have available to participate

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,919
in the discussions defining processes

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
and doing some tasks on demand

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,159
so so the first step the first step is

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
communication

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,600
and it's communicating with the design

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
system

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,840
team channel in general so we have this

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,799
slack channel

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,440
and every time someone a designer or a

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,520
developer sees the necessity of having a

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,559
new component or reporting a bug

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,720
or proposing a new a new change they can

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,400
go to the slack channel we have

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,520
formats of a format of a message

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,799
where they can state uh what they need

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,960
uh if it's a new thing updates or bug

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,039
what is the impact why is it necessary

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,960
if it's urgent or not

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,159
and then we discuss on slack and it's an

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,880
open channel

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,360
and everyone interested should chime in

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,760
uh

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
but also ultimately the governance team

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
will participate in the discussion

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,000
and help with any clarifications needed

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
and we are committed to at least at the

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
end of the day

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,720
uh to close the discussion to either

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,799
say okay the this is the thing that is

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
going to move forward oh no we

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,159
we actually don't think this is

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,520
something necessary

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,200
uh so and we we put this hard deadline

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,679
because if we are not agile and

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
response and respond to people quickly

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
people will start seeing this as a

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
blocker and won't bother to collaborate

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,080
with the design system

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,240
so we try to make it as agile as we can

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,080
um and then next then the design once

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
the this new change is approved the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,280
designer then creates

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,200
the component in the designer's ui

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
toolkit and make it available to

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
engineers

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,640
using using sapling and it's ideally

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
also at this stage

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,520
that they will be documented documenting

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
the the component at zero height

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
but this might also happen in parallel

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,440
during the component implementation

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,480
depending on time

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
uh zero height is a this documentation

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
platform

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,320
which is very user friend friendly so

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,039
you don't need to know code to use it

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,039
and and it's very powerful because it

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,840
can easily integrate with tools like

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,799
sapling

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,480
and developer tools like storybook so we

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,200
have zero height page

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,200
and it is supposed to be our source of

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,120
truth regarding documentation

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,880
of the design system so everything

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,080
related to the design system from

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,720
principles to foundations and

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,360
component specifications you you can

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,360
find it there

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
and then we start implementing it

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,799
finally the fun part

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,080
so like i mentioned our current design

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,520
system is using

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,080
react and typescript and we have styled

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,760
systems and emotion for styling

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
and here i'm going to share some of the

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,039
tools tools that we use for development

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,480
that help us a lot so first thing and

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,720
for most this storybook

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,679
storybook is amazing for documenting

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,440
everything

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,679
and seriously if you're not using

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,720
storybook yet you're missing out

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,840
even if you don't have a library

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,799
a real library of components you can

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,240
have storybook in your own in your

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,559
product project

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
and and start using it to help you

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,120
document

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,159
uh the components that you have because

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,799
it will with storybook we can create

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,960
stories

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,000
which are examples of different usages

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,960
of the components

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
we can display the api of the components

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
and

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,360
it also serves as a playground for

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
developers and other people and others

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
to

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,799
to play around with the components and

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,720
for example we have a switcher between

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,520
the olegs and the motor spin

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,240
so so we can see how the components

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
behave

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,679
in these different scenarios

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,559
um we also use commitsin

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,960
for our commit messages so these help us

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,720
standardize our commit messages if it's

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
a new feature if it's a breaking change

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,080
etc

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,760
and these so this will create a

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,320
structured commit message

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,120
and this will come behind handy after

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,760
when

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,760
when we are going to publish the library

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,240
and to ensure that the commit messages

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
are actually in the right format and

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,679
and have the right information in it we

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,080
use commit links

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:33,440
to to help linking the commit messages

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,080
we also have tests in place so we have

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
tests

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,440
for implementation and functionalities

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,840
of the components

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,360
and most recently we've also added

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,720
visual regression tests

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,840
to our library so for

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,240
for unit tests um we

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,679
are using react testing library so we

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
use it to check to

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,600
to test the different states and change

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,000
of states if

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,760
it's happening correctly also some basic

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,039
user user interaction

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,799
and if it's behaving correctly with uh

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,320
when something happens to the component

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,200
for example here

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,039
um this is a test for the button base

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
which we are checking if it's raining

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,320
the attributes correctly

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,880
or if it's setting custom items

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,200
correctly for example

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,799
and like i mentioned before we are also

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,840
using now

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,240
we have visual regression tests we use a

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,799
set of official storybook add-ons

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,880
alongside a test runner container which

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,039
has a specific puppeteer version to

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,840
provide it so we are running the test

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,559
inside a docker image

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,880
and what we do is that when we trigger

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,679
the

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,440
the visual regression tests it will look

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,760
through the storybook stories

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,679
so it will get all of those examples of

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,960
the components that we created

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,039
and it's going to create a snapshot uh

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,720
a snapshot of the components in the

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,880
stories

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,799
and then later when we have a new change

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,760
or something and we run the test again

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,960
it will run it will create new snapshots

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,600
and then it's going to

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,520
overlap with the old ones and check the

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,960
difference between them

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,919
and if they don't match we get a warning

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,880
and and this is super useful because for

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,559
example here

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,799
if we are looking just at the new

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,360
screenshots we might not even

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,799
have noticed that the padding of the

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,120
button is actually

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,120
bigger right now than the original one

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,799
if if you're just working and just

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,640
seeing the final button and not

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,919
even comparing to the last one we would

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,000
not have noticed

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,960
but with the visual regression too it

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
becomes

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,200
very obvious that the padding is very

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,000
different right now

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,559
between the two versions so so we can

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,960
now act on it

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,720
and then the last stage we finally

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
publish it

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,960
so for publishing our library we are

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,679
using semantic release

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,159
to automate releasing so it will take

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,960
those beautiful messages created by

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,240
by commitsin and it's going to version

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,720
the library based on them

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,200
so for example if we if the commit

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,760
message was indicating it was a feature

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,880
it is going to bump a minor change if

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,640
the commit message

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
was saying that it was a breaking change

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,320
it's going to bump a major

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
if it's just a patch or a fix or

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,600
something like that

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,480
it's going to to patch a patch

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,120
to raise a patch version and if it

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
wasn't

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,480
if there were no changes at all for

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
example it was just i don't know

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,760
pipeline ci changes

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,360
or something like that then it's not

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,200
even going to bother to

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,399
do a new release because nothing their

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
library really changes

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,640
um and i forgot to mention that also

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,440
semantic release we will also create a

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,679
change log

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,799
based on the commit messages that we

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,000
sent

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,080
and then we have cicd in place so

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,120
we have this set of pipelines running on

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,799
the master branch

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,120
so as soon as a merge request is

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,559
approved and merged to master and the

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,000
pipelines are all green

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
a new version of the library is

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,720
published to our internal registry and

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
now

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,200
it is available and the new version of

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
storybox published and now it is

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,279
available for

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,240
any developer to just any pm install it

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,120
and and profit everybody is free to

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,919
start using it

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,919
in their products

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,960
so these are the development experience

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,159
that we had

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,200
and i want to to close this with some

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,120
conclusions

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,240
uh that i gather after working on nexus

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,880
so so first thing is that i i can say

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
that

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,440
working in the shared design system

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,679
really helped us ensuring the coherent

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,039
experience like i was saying before

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,640
um and it helps with all of

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,559
those other aspects that i was talking

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,240
about it's helping us to focus on real

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,880
problems that we need to solve

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
for example recently i was working on a

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,919
proof of concept

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,399
of a new data structure that we wanted

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,200
to to try in the listing page

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,919
and the layout the the designer

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
delivered

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,520
was based in the design system so

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,840
instead of spending some time trying to

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,960
replicate the ui and creating the

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,279
diffusion components i just got the

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,240
the right components from the design

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
system and

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,039
it was done in minutes and then i could

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,559
spend my time focusing on what really

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,640
mattered which was

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,960
studying this new data structure that we

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,840
wanted to display in the ui

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,760
and and the common language has also

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,480
helped us to focus the discussions

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,279
they are very accessible to everybody

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
and

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,120
like i said not only for engineers and

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,200
designers but product managers in

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,039
general also very easily can grasp the

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,120
concepts when we are talking when

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,039
everything is are just components it's

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:54,000
super simple for them to grasp it

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,279
and and on the topic of communication

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,799
yeah communication is

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,120
very important in in this case

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,440
um it's super important to be aligned

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,760
between tech design and products

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,159
because hardly you're going to start a

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,039
design system having instant buy-in

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,440
and creating a team for it usually the

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,200
motivation we will start with developers

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,159
and designers when they notice that

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,559
creating these

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,080
guidelines and principles is going to

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,799
improve the product they're

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,440
they're delivering and it's also going

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,640
to

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,120
improve their workflow it's better when

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,360
both devs and designers are interested

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,519
in starting the design system

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,880
because once it starts it's beautiful to

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,000
see the results

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,480
recently we had a collaboration between

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,640
designer designers from different teams

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,399
between the legs and motors

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,480
they were both sharing the research that

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,120
they were doing when they were exploring

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,200
some chat components and so they were

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,320
collaborating defining rules and sharing

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,080
experiences

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,760
and these are people that are working on

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,159
different hubs so

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,000
having the opportunity to work together

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
and bring the discussions

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,320
and and bring them closer was really

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,360
nice and the design system

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
helped a lot with that

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
but sometimes the design system might

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,039
start

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,080
one-sided it's either only the designers

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,919
or only the

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,399
developers that are interested in

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,120
starting it especially because it will

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,240
require some work beforehand

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,399
but in the end it's not that much if you

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,159
consider that you still need to develop

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,480
your product either way

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,320
so you might as well be doing it in a

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
more structured manner

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,399
this is not much different of having a

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,480
design critique or code review in place

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,679
we are just scaling the discussions and

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,080
the alignments

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,000
so it's not like you're creating that

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,600
much extra work

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,440
because you still are going to have to

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,919
work on these things anyway

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,039
so in the end we all want to deliver

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,159
good products

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,200
and good user experiences so the design

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,000
system will help you with that

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,159
um on the topic of having a cleaner code

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,600
base i'll bring back the topic about the

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,640
base components

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,559
and it goes beyond that so the base

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,559
components come from the concept of

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,240
breaking down your components

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,080
because when in doubt you should be

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,120
breaking down uh

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,760
so if your component is already

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,519
having a lot of business logic in it or

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,799
if it's starting to become too big

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
it's probably because you're not

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,120
abstracting it enough and you're not

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,679
making it reusable

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,799
and it's starting to become very complex

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,000
situation

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,200
so even even a simple text field

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,559
can be broken down into labeling inputs

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,880
and and then these these smaller parts

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,080
can then be used later to compose with

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
other things

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,320
but be careful to not start breaking it

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,039
too much or you end up with dust

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,000
and we don't want then we won't be able

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,519
to work

00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,399
uh on that level and then finally

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,799
please please please please do define

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,000
well

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,320
your tokens or the token police is going

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,399
to come after you

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,119
and that's it for today thank you very

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,119
much everybody

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,480
thank you all very much it was uh

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,200
it was really nice i really enjoyed it

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,560
now

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,800
we are open for four questions so

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,599
if you have any questions just unmute

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
yourself

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,839
or you can post them down in the

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,839
in the chat

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,079
uh i can i can go can i go first

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,200
yes yes sure so first of all

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,839
congratulations

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,760
it was an awesome presentation

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,560
sorry

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,599
uh it was great very lively and straight

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,520
to the point

00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,680
very clear uh i just wanted to ask you

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:05,200
if you have any idea of the time it took

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,160
for you to develop or to create at least

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,240
the first version that you could present

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,520
to you to the whole company

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,320
and um yeah i just wanted to

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,480
get to know a bit more about that please

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,760
um

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,640
yeah so specific timelines because we

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,119
didn't

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,040
let's say just stopped everything that

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,640
you're working like like i said you're

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,320
not going to start a design system

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,960
saying oh now we have a design system

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,560
team

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
and everybody is going to stop what

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,280
they're doing and work on it

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,520
so we worked on it in parallel to

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,960
the other tasks that we're already

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,079
working on

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,640
um but i have to say that no

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,200
it's not super fast it's not like a week

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,839
or so

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
we probably spent a couple of months

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,599
building

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,200
the design the the basic library

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,960
uh initially i'm talking more about

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
the the design system that we had in

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,839
waters because i worked on that from the

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,040
start

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,680
on the one from alex i don't really know

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,160
so how long how long they took because

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,280
when i

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,640
started working on it it was already uh

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,760
it was already a very big library there

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,720
but but yeah and and we started like

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,040
real simple just getting the components

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,839
that

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,640
actually we already had on on our code

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,880
base

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,760
and cleaning them up and abstracting

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,240
them a little bit

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,760
and moving and moving to to a separate

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,760
library at first we were even

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
considering doing it just in a separate

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,040
folder inside the own project

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,359
but then we're like no let's do it

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,560
properly put in the in its own place

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,000
with documentation and we

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,079
it's not in the presentation anymore

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,760
because we are not using it on nexus

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,640
but we used kcd scripts which is a

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,000
library from

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,200
kcd that is the creator of the react

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,599
testing library

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,280
so he has these really nice scripts that

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,839
he uses for his open

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,400
source projects that helps with boosting

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,800
up running the test and publishing

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,680
so it helped us a lot with setting up

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,320
the

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,560
this individual repo with the library

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,760
and so that sped up a lot the process so

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,240
we only

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,200
really needed to take care of

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,839
structuring

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,599
stretching the the project and moving

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,320
the the components there

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,119
and we had tickets for like all creating

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,359
creating the

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
creating the button creating in pure

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,280
html

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,839
creating it in react and we are doing it

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,359
as alongside oh so we are now working on

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,079
this feature and we need a button we

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,880
need a checkbox

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,200
we need an input so before working on

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
that

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
we are going to create that in the

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,440
design system

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
so maybe having the library itself

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,960
although

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
almost empty it was like two weeks i

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,960
think

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,560
one or two weeks working on it uh

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,119
yeah because like i said this script

00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,320
helped us a lot to speed up the process

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,400
but then but then later uh

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,760
to having a lot of components yeah it's

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,560
how long we took to

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,160
people start moving and even today we

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,599
sometimes make some adjustments because

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,640
it's still being used in parts of the

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,640
product

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,160
yeah thank you you're welcome yes and

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,400
please hi

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,920
so i have two questions but i'm gonna go

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,280
with the

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,000
first one i guess it's easier um

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,400
uh you said that you're using emotion

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,480
for

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,800
uh the styling i was wondering so um

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,920
in our design system we are using styled

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,240
components

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,280
and i haven't found a good way to

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,160
um to do the props like to show the

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,520
props for

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,119
styled components and i was wondering

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,560
if you ran into the same thing because

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,560
the default storybook

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,200
block for props does not work with the

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,720
props that are passed to a styled

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,880
component

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:09,359
okay i see so

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,560
uh for the emotion part i'm i'm not sure

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,280
but i know that so we use emotion

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,760
for the things like css in js and we are

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,200
using

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,839
styled system uh for doing like you said

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
we

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,800
we have props to pass some stylings in

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,839
in some base components and for that

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,359
we didn't have much issues with

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,480
storybook i believe the library

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,520
was able to handle it well

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,320
what i can say is that when we worked on

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,920
ignition

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,560
for the props we use the plugin for the

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,520
for for readme files that would take the

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,119
readme

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,920
and we are using prop types yes prop

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,720
types

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,960
uh for defining the components and we

00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,079
use the tag that was like

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,560
props i think uh inside the readme file

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,680
and it would automatically generate

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,760
the the props itself uh the table of

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,359
of the props of the component but i'm

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,880
not sure if that was

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,960
what you're really asking so can you

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,319
elaborate a little bit more so you say

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,440
you're using style

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,720
styled components yes um

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,920
so um i'm also using prop types

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,520
for the components but i do have some

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,599
components in my

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,119
design system that are just styled

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,599
components like

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,880
let's say a label would be a styled

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,680
component of

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,960
type label and it takes some props like

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
color

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,280
or margin bottom let's say

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,440
and these props uh because i only

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,319
defined them for the style component and

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,599
not for the react component

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,079
storybook doesn't know how to uh port

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,760
them

00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,720
in the props uh so like to

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,160
it you cannot do prop types on a styled

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,960
component

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,680
so the props that you just pass into the

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,760
component

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,440
and that you use in the style component

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,680
they don't get picked up by storybook

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,720
okay and i'm actually here on the side

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,800
and i'm checking

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:24,079
our code base real quick to see

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,640
to see if i because

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,319
because yeah uh we are displaying right

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,359
now in our storybook the

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,200
the props that are coming it is

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,880
finding the props from typescript and

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,960
it's also finding

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,880
the props that we use because of styled

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,560
system

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,480
but right now i don't quite remember

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,160
if there was any special treatment for

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,359
that

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,359
it's fine i don't wanna uh i don't wanna

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,640
hold down the conversation i was just

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,520
wondering if you

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,920
ran into this or if you know more than i

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,560
do

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,640
was this case yeah no in this case no

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,400
the problems that i had with props and

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,640
and storybook was um

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
was related to using prop types and

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,880
using

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,920
cop composed uh oh yeah i also had this

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,880
problem yeah

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,119
and that one i was not really able to to

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,880
solve it uh

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,880
yeah there's an open issue for that

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,560
like object object or something like

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,520
that and yeah

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,599
add a special note for this oh yeah yeah

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,240
we would manually then add to the readme

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,240
file

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,280
uh the specification of these composed

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,440
types because

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,359
yeah i'm sorry now i'm also interested

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,000
if i find something later i'll let you

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,440
know okay i'll let somebody else ask the

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
question and then

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,880
i'll ask another question if there's

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,280
time thank you

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,839
you're welcome uh okay so hika

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,480
hi a great presentation so i was

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,160
wondering

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,079
you mentioned briefly that at least

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,520
some parts of their using organization

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,119
of our companies it's

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,839
uh inspired by by airbnb

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,440
so let's imagine that i'm starting a new

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,839
design system today

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,160
what would be great inspirations for me

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:17,200
like who should i look into

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,240
oh okay the list is big

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,280
uh so so yeah the the airbnb one

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,680
is is a great uh

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,359
is a great starting point there is this

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,480
presentation that they gave

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,319
at a conference a few years ago

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,839
where they explained this part of they

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,560
they also had a similar experience

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,400
to uh it was where they started with one

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,200
design system and then evolved into

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,560
another one

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,920
and and how they structured um

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,560
another really nice talk is and and

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,000
although it's not public is the design

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,079
system from badou

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,079
so like i also mentioned in the in the

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,960
presentation if you look for

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,079
a presentation for from cristiano

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,599
rostelli

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,079
uh he also explains the

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,440
the full process he he has three blog

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,800
posts very

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,480
uh very longs about uh

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
about the process of starting the design

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,000
system at badoo and

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,599
they also have the situation of using it

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
across different brands inside the

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,480
company

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,599
another really good

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,440
really good blog posts uh are from

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,119
nathan curtis so nathan curtis is

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,720
almost like a father of the design

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,839
system he has

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,319
a lot of topics he he's one then talks a

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,079
lot about tokens for example and how to

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,760
help structure them and structuring the

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,440
base of your design system

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,000
he has a lot of also posts about how to

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,400
how to structure your design system how

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,440
to help organizing our team

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,480
and and yes he

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,760
he has a lot many many many topics uh

00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,560
many publications about it and then

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,880
design systems to get inspiration from

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,000
we also looked a lot into carbon

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,560
design system which is from

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,880
ibm yes carbon is from ibn

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,079
uh they they also have the library

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,400
actually done in

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,000
four different frameworks so they have

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,240
for react they have for view

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,520
they have for angular they have for just

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,800
pure css

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,240
so and it's and it's open source so it's

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,560
it's there for you to look at the code

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,400
and it's really nice

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,839
uh another nice library that we use

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,200
um it's a little bit more basic but it's

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,440
the protocol

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,560
uh storybook which is the one for

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
mozilla

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,079
so they actually work more with pure

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,800
components but they also

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,560
have some some nice definitions about

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,440
atoms and so on

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,160
and then lastly i would also recommend

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,000
uh

00:45:52,160 --> 00:46:00,319
i think it's it's it's not spotlight

00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,760
i always i always confuse the name

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,760
but it's the one from salesforce

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,079
i don't find this the design system

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,880
itself super pretty

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,599
but this structure is very good and the

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,800
definitions of the components

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,800
it's not spotlight

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,839
i think it's lightning lightning yes yes

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,720
it's something with light thank you

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,319
yes it is lightning uh storybook and

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,720
it's also very

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,400
very well structured and it's a nice

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,880
inspiration

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,079
thank you fran i gave you a lot of a lot

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,680
of things to research

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,680
i hope everybody took notes

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,040
um and that just before got to you

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,280
because i just saw there was a message

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,560
in

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:50,880
the chat also so dimitro was asking

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,040
how do you organize code for design

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,599
library is this monorepo or a set of

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,200
separate repositories

00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:02,240
uh so currently we are using a monorepo

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:06,640
just sorry just because we found it

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:11,839
easier to to handle it this way we've

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,839
sorry my my voice is saying one second

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,640
so we we very briefly

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,240
considered using something like learner

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,160
and versioning the components

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,520
individually

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,480
but since it was easier to just have a

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,440
monorepo

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,200
and and just doing publishes and and

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,760
everything in a single place

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,520
we decided to to have a single ripple

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,599
with the single versioning

00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,559
and something that could be a lot more

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,160
in the future

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,599
because for example right now we work

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,160
with truncate the

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,960
truncate development so a new version we

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,400
don't have like

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,359
but beta versions or or like if we have

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,200
a new major

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,839
we still are doing things for the

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,880
previous for the previous major version

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,559
so you either fully migrate to the new

00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,440
one or you are missing out on new

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,240
updates

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,880
so so yeah that's that's what happens

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,520
when we

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,880
we need to keep it simple uh in the

00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,760
development process and so far

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,160
it is working dealing with major i can i

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,760
can talk a little bit more about

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,920
how we are handling breaking changes

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,119
right now uh but yeah

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,240
sometimes can be challenging uh and now

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,000
yes

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,559
and sorry uh

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,839
what was your question uh another

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,839
question that i have

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:35,200
is another um problem that i've run into

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,920
with our design system um how do you

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,359
manage

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,480
the api consistency between components

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,119
so do you also describe that

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,839
at the beginning like along with the

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,559
tokens

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,559
or some somewhere uh what

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,240
what shorthand for props you should use

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,200
or

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,040
uh if something is positioning something

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,520
like above or below

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,800
is there always a prop that's going like

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:10,480
end of question you know i

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,400
i got it i got it um we currently don't

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,960
have a proper documentation

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,359
on our guidelines like with the rules

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,839
for the api

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,520
but we do keep them in mind when we are

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,640
doing code review for example

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,960
and if someone is bringing

00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,880
a prop for example for displaying a text

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,880
to to a component or something

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,800
we might go back to it and say oh did

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,640
you check how the other components are

00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,280
implementing this are you keeping the

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,800
the same the same structure so although

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,839
we don't have rules

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,559
we we do try uh as a group to to keep

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,200
consistency and

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,800
we are working harder on it right now

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,480
because for example i can say with the

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,800
previous design system

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,079
uh as it was being done a little bit

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,000
more adult so

00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:01,040
a little bit on more on demand um

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
we we we went a little bit more freely

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,760
so

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,800
let let's see what sticks let's let's

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,880
try it out

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,000
and in the end it happened what you're

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,319
mentioning so

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,240
we had a component that to display the

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,440
text inside we were using a prop called

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,440
display text

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,200
and then another component had label and

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,359
then another component had text and

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,040
another component was using children

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,839
so we didn't have a clear structure and

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,599
and it was a clear problem that we are

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,319
trying to remediate on nexus

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,359
but that is more on keeping a closer eye

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:35,119
on that

00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,800
and and and helping

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,240
using either common practices for

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,440
example right now okay

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,240
for text inside it's better to use the

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,760
to use the children and then we try to

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,720
have a label or

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,319
a text prop we we see the others uh how

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,400
other components are done and try to

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,520
replicate that

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,240
yeah but i would recommend having

00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,599
having an api more defined and with the

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,200
structure of

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,680
how props usually should be should be

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,200
should be done because it will cause

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,160
problems in the future if you're not

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,160
paying attention to that

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,319
yeah let's see welcome

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,319
and then i saw that daniella asked if i

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,400
could share the resources in the middle

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,760
in the meetup details afterwards and yes

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,079
that's a great idea

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,240
uh i realized yeah that i i gave a lot

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,000
of tips on on these resources i'm

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,160
i'm going to publish it to post it in

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,040
the in the meetup

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:40,079
channel later

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:43,520
yes i have a question uh

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:48,000
when do you think it's worth creating a

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,000
design system for a company or a product

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,640
uh when it's worth it

00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:00,480
i want to say always but i know

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,280
it's hard and it's not that simple uh

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,040
i would say that at least trying to

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,920
document the components that you're

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,640
having

00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,760
at least trying to give them a structure

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:15,040
at least trying to use storybook

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,520
so the things that you're creating it's

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,240
very easily discoverable by the

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,240
developers

00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,720
so so yeah at least starting with

00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,839
the basic things so having the component

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,760
structure

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,119
trying to have storybook or something to

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,119
showcase them

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,760
and also on the designer side they

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,760
probably have a shared library

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,800
of the components that they use on

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,800
sketch and so on

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,880
so yeah having that base will help you a

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,960
lot

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,550
to jump to a design system later so

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:54,480
the moment to jump to a design system

00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:57,599
[Music]

00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,720
is perhaps when you start iterating over

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,880
your product

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,079
so perhaps you already have a product

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,720
that

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,640
is starting to get established and

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,040
you're starting to create new things on

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,359
it

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,480
and you want to be consistent on that on

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,119
those things

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,960
so you don't have an impulse that looks

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,280
like something in one place

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,880
and then you have a form that has uh

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,200
because here i'm talking about

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,000
actually about small things like buttons

00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
and inputs

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,839
but it goes beyond that like i was

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,480
mentioning we had these designers

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,640
discussing about chat components so

00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,319
so for example how the chat bubbles

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,000
would be should be structured

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,559
where should we display information

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,040
about time how should we deal with

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:43,760
uh with with attachments to the messages

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,119
we also had designers discussing about

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,440
posting forms

00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,640
and for example the structures if we

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,319
should have steps

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,160
in the form if we should display

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,599
optional components with the fact that

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,760
they are optional

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,280
sorry option optional fields or if it

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,800
should only be marking

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,720
uh required ones so

00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,240
the design system will also help with

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,040
that so when you start

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,880
dealing with more complex things uh

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,680
having this kind of studies and having

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,960
this kind of

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,440
discussions helps a lot so

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,079
you might already have a design system

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,920
happening

00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,440
uh behind the curtains and you don't

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,559
even know about it

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,559
uh so yeah probably that's the moment

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,960
when you're starting discussing and

00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,079
improvements and creating new things

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,880
and you are discussing better experience

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,960
you should probably keep note of that so

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,079
you continue doing that in the future

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,799
and that might be the moment

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,599
yeah thank you you're welcome i hope i

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,640
kind of answered

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,640
it yeah

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,640
does anyone else have any questions just

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,119
unmute yourself or post them in the

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,119
in the chat

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,000
um i can i can also expand a little bit

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,240
more

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,680
on some things uh once i i got a

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,480
question why do we use

00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,280
zero height if we also have storybook

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,040
why not just

00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,960
only use storybook for example for

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,119
documenting everything

00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,960
and the answer that we are liking to use

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,240
zero height one is that

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:20,319
like i mentioned it's very

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,839
user friendly and especially because

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,359
then designers don't have

00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,960
because if we are going to use only

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,760
storybook then

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,440
if the designers want to add for example

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,000
the do's and don'ts and

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,119
and more details about usage of

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,839
components

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,599
they will need to know how to deal with

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,200
markdown language they are going to need

00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,799
to know how to do a commit they are

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,160
going to need to know how to create a

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,319
pull request

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,040
and and this kind of thing so it starts

00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:51,280
creating a lot of layers of complexity

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:53,440
and it's not really worth it so

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,799
so in this case for us zero height has

00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,359
been an amazing tone

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,559
too that they can and it's kind of weeks

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,000
or squarespace you

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,760
they just go there and they just put the

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,440
text box and start typing and then they

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,440
link with the examples from zeppelin

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,160
they link with storybook

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,000
and it's it's a very nice tool and then

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,119
in the end storybook it's really useful

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,839
for the developers

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,640
to have this playground and the api

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,520
check

00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,520
on the components

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:35,920
hey ender okay so uh shout outs

00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:39,359
hey um i have another quick question

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,920
um i was wondering so

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,920
some of the components uh that i did

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,559
that we developed in our design system

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,440
also

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,799
had the same uh path that your

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,079
components started out

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,359
like uh developing things ad hoc as we

00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,040
needed them

00:56:53,359 --> 00:57:00,720
and that keeps happening uh as

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,400
more and more uh like the products are

00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,040
growing and there are more products

00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,640
using the design system and so what is

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,200
your strategy

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,480
you mentioned uh the primary button

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,680
secondary button

00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,880
to not have a lot of props for one

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,040
component or

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,240
having a lot of variants for the same

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,599
component

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,839
but still do you have other tips for

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,200
or a strategy for keeping props

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,480
manageable

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,599
an example would be if um if i have a

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,599
component that

00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,799
has a wrapper and some children like

00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,760
generate some children

00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:37,119
based on like inside like let's say

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
notification and you need

00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,960
notifications inside the notifications

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,839
container and you need to

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,720
space the children differently you would

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,200
need an

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,440
extra prop to pass the container so it

00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:53,440
spaces the children differently

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:56,799
so these things can just pop up

00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,480
as as components grow so do you have a

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:02,160
strategy or tips to

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:05,520
keep these things manageable

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,319
or consistent yeah what we try to keep

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,359
in mind

00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,559
is if we are starting to add a lot of

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,400
complexity

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,000
to one component so like you're saying

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,200
if you're starting to create a lot of

00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,160
props for it

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,200
it's probably a cold smell that you're

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,119
either

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,520
having a component that is doing too

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,280
much so you're probably

00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,280
should be breaking it into two different

00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,400
components

00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,480
or you're probably adding you're

00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,680
probably customizing this component

00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,000
too much for you and it won't be that

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,359
much

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,400
reusable later so probably be because

00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:44,880
we we also have this step so uh

00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,799
what we have in the library should be

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,440
abstract enough to be used by

00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,400
by everybody so if you're starting to

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,559
say

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,520
oh but here for this feature that i'm

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,799
working on

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,079
i actually need this notification icon

00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,280
to be a little bit

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,760
more centered or something like that so

00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,599
when you're starting to change the

00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,240
behavior or you're starting to change

00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,160
the pattern

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,520
of the design system so that's probably

00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,480
something that one you shouldn't be

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,040
doing

00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,200
or if it is something that it's actually

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,240
a recurring case or is something

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:22,400
that will benefit and

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,200
allow more usage then okay then maybe we

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,359
can discuss

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,200
how to how to implement that um

00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,000
and then in the case of the component

00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,160
getting too complex for example recently

00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,760
we were discussed and it all starts in

00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,160
the discussion in

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,280
in that in that slide that i posted

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,720
before about the

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,680
the communication part so it everything

00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,680
starts with that

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,599
so the person starts for example

00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,640
recently we got a suggestion about a

00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,280
tooltip

00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,200
that they wanted to to have steps on it

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,319
for onboarding so like having a

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,040
uh arrows for going to the next one

00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,079
and and steps for changing the the

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,119
tooltip between

01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,960
in different places of the screen and

01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:08,400
we're like okay yeah so

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,160
we see this component it makes sense to

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,400
have this component to help dealing with

01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,720
onboarding so we can we can have them

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,720
the many steps and et cetera et cetera

01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,040
but then we're like okay but remember

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,640
it was still a tooltip what is what is

01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,400
the purpose of a tooltip

01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,240
it is to pop up and show some

01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,880
information and that's it

01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,079
so if we are now adding this extra

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,119
functionality

01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,160
of the tooltip to also be doing a step

01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,079
uh doing steps of onboarding it's we are

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,720
starting to increase the responsibility

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,640
of it

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,319
so perhaps you should step back and see

01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,599
okay so here we are actually dealing

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,920
with two different things

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,839
we have the tooltip that appears on

01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,839
hover or on click when you need

01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,760
and you need a different content inside

01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,960
it that is the onboarding that is a

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,359
stepper

01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,799
so so then we discuss okay so we need to

01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,880
break it down

01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,480
and perhaps we even are needing a pop

01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,839
over something that is more

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,960
uh fixed to the screen and so let's

01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:07,040
define that and and

01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,960
and focus only on this small component

01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,160
and then we can compose that

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,040
with the tooltip inside so this will

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,200
help you

01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,079
with keeping the props a little bit

01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,319
smaller

01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,319
because yeah if you're starting to add

01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,640
too much customization

01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,720
uh then it's a balance if you want your

01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,000
design system to be super flexible

01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:30,400
or more constrained but usually i

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,520
on what i think if you're starting to

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,440
add too much props

01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,799
your component probably is starting to

01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,720
do too much

01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,000
and you probably would benefit from

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,160
breaking it down

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,440
and having the responsibilities more

01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,440
defined for each one

01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,760
i hope that helps awesome

01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,960
may i proceed with

01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:04,960
okay i understand that there are

01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,680
certain kind of behaviors that

01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,000
are not on scope or at least are not

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,559
that

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,440
in geoscope of a design system that is

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,480
the

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,599
explanation growing with the time or

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:21,200
an uncontrolled growing of a

01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:24,960
component or a group of components

01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:28,079
but how

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,160
have you dealt in the past with the

01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,359
same scenario where for instance there

01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,480
are

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,720
not just a couple but multiple teams

01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:40,319
consuming the same design system

01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:44,160
proceeding at different speeds

01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:47,760
and with the different necessities

01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,559
at not at the same time for example

01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,839
they will eventually need a certain

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,119
feature on a

01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:58,960
component but

01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,000
it's just not doable to operate that

01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,720
component

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:09,200
to be widely available for all the teams

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:12,960
have you worked with on spot

01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,160
changes so each team that is consuming

01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:19,520
that component starts to do

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,880
uh not an abstraction but an extension

01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,839
of that component with

01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,799
the functionality they want or they

01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,559
simply start

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:31,760
to mutate the component of noise that

01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,039
becomes unreadable on a

01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:38,799
given period of time uh yeah so

01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:41,280
inside the library itself we we

01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,799
keep a closer look so like i just

01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,119
mentioned now having them

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,319
the components mutating a lot and doing

01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,720
a lot of things

01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,559
on that we try to keep a closer eye on

01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,520
it and

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,559
and that won't happen unless we really

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,960
agreed on it

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,400
but outside the library yes it happens

01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,440
sometimes that people

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,400
take the shortcut and oh i actually

01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,319
needed this

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,480
tooltip to look in a different color or

01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,920
i need something to look differently and

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,359
we'll just overwrite

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,000
when we notice that then we reach out to

01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,760
the people that

01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,599
are doing these changes and asking oh

01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,039
why did you need this variation is this

01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,920
something that perhaps we could

01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,200
be supporting and then yeah we we asked

01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,200
the people to

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,559
to come to the design system and do the

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,520
changes that they need

01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,920
and deliver sometimes if the rush is too

01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,000
much

01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,520
to to deliver something and it's not

01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,760
possible then

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,680
uh they do the change and then we ask oh

01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,119
but please later come back

01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:42,000
and and update that in the design system

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,400
and then update that in the library so

01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,720
it

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,799
it happens and it's more based on

01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,400
communication and we're going after and

01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:51,839
trying to sync and align

01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,599
uh there is no oh bad you now delete

01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,720
these and and

01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,920
we are not on that level

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,119
because we if

01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,920
we want it or not that's something that

01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,000
tends to to kill this kind of

01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,520
initiatives of having an internal

01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,160
design system that can end up

01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,039
as another project that's simply a mess

01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,839
and not

01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,640
easy and it's not serving his initial

01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:26,319
purpose

01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:28,799
yeah that's exactly it uh jimmy

01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:29,760
i see you popping up your screen yeah

01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,800
sorry

01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,440
you had a question too yeah i have

01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,640
[Music]

01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,440
my question is regarding browser

01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,839
capability like

01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,039
what kind of browser support do you

01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,760
provide

01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,640
and what's even more interesting like

01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,960
can it

01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,000
how do you handle browser capability

01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,319
conflicts

01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,520
let's say when consumer wants uh

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,880
something

01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:59,280
like support of ie6

01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:02,000
let's say so yes of right now

01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,200
in the company we are not supporting

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
that out of a naive so that that is fine

01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,319
uh yeah what we try to keep in mind is

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,280
like

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,839
resetting the styles so we so for

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,760
example

01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,520
if you're using the component on firefox

01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,400
it doesn't have suddenly a gray

01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,680
background

01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,200
on something um that is definitely

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,000
something that we could actually do a

01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,920
little bit better

01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,680
right now i think we tend to test more

01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,039
the components on chrome

01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,760
um and and when building the library we

01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,920
have like

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,680
the the configuration i believe the

01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,079
browsers that we support like all

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,440
x minus versions of chrome x minus

01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,559
versions of mozilla

01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,720
like this basic stuff and

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,319
and currently i know that on motors we

01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,960
have graceful degradation for

01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:48,240
ie 11. i'm not sure about our legs how

01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,319
they are doing so

01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,760
i know that our components at least need

01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:55,280
to work on

01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:57,119
edge and up and the e11 is is more of a

01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,640
graceful degradation thing than

01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:04,559
full full-on support

01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:07,839
thanks and one more extra question

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,720
what kind of uh tool chain are you using

01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:11,839
to build the actual project is it react

01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,920
scripts or

01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:20,880
something else to to build the projects

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:24,400
we bundle out bundle we are using

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,400
prolap yes we are using relock to bundle

01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,039
the library

01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,760
and for development react scripts

01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:34,720
probably

01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,760
or i mean development mode to show it in

01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,960
browser

01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,920
uh we are using storybook so

01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,599
we run storybook and create the stories

01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,559
and start seeing the components in the

01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,079
stories

01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:51,359
yeah okay yeah thanks
