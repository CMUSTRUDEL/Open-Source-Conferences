00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,910
I did there

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,280
it's called waiting for response but

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,700
just a second javascript doesn't like to

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,580
wait

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,240
in fact javascript waits for nobody so

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,279
how do we tame it how do we make it wait

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,250
here's how we'll use a sink away and

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,500
we'll work time so that it seems it

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,500
seems that javascript is now waiting

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,900
