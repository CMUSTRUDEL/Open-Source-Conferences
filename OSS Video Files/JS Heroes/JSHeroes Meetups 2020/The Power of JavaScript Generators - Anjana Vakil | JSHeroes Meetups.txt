Title: The Power of JavaScript Generators - Anjana Vakil | JSHeroes Meetups
Publication date: 2020-10-13
Playlist: JSHeroes Meetups 2020
Description: 
	Generators have been around in JavaScript since ES2015, yet remain largely ignored by many JS devs, who don't see why or how they'd use them in their day-to-day work.
But generators - which we can think of as special functions whose execution can be "paused" and resumed later on - are actually extremely powerful tools for producing and consuming series of data. That makes them perfect for implementing lazy sequences, custom iterables, animation, even the convenient asynchronous programming we now enjoy with "await"!

In this talk we'll dive into how JS generators work, what makes them so powerful, and why you should care.
