Meetup Description:

Hi there JavaScript remote (probably) people,

Let's have an open discussion about state management.
Anything from: flux (redux, mobx etc.), MVC, state machines or other design patterns of your liking. Let's talk about them and tear them to bits and pieces.

The open discussion format is a way for everybody to contribute, so don't shy away, we love to hear your thoughts. We also accept the shy ones so don't worry if you just want to listen.
