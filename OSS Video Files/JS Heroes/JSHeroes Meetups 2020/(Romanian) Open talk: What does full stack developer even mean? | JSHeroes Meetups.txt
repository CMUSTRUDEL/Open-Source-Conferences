Publication date: 2020-10-06
Playlist: JSHeroes Meetups 2020
Description: 
	The language used for this meetup  is romanian as we didn't had anyone joining outside Romania participants at this meetup (we would have loved to have guests from outside Romania). 

We open up the meetups season with a very interesting open discussion:

Have you ever wondered what does a full stack developer even mean? So did we!

The term full stack can be a bit opaque and may refer to a whole lot... or does it? Let's find out together!

The open discussion format gives a chance to everybody who joins to have a say and we can't wait to hear your ideas and opinions on the subject. Also, if you just want to sit and listen, that's ok too you are still welcomed.

Note: This meetup will be recorded and posted on our youtube channel.
