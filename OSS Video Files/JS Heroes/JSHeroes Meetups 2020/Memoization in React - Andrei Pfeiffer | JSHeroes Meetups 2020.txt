Title: Memoization in React - Andrei Pfeiffer | JSHeroes Meetups 2020
Publication date: 2020-04-20
Playlist: JSHeroes Meetups 2020
Description: 
	It is said that React is "fast enough". This is very true for most applications. However, rendering performance problems might occur in 2 different situations:

1) when we render many components or native elements, or
2) when we perform very frequent updates, during animations or gestures.

During this talk, we'll focus on the first use-case mentioned above. We'll identify performance problems, measure them using the React Profiler and fix them using various optimisation techniques such as React.memo(), useMemo() and useCallback().
