Description: 
	In the past our lives were simple. Big data chunks were lists of thousands of entities.

Today data is more complex and in much bigger quantities.
The solution that worked for small data just doesn’t scale.
Suddenly your beautiful microservice starts having memory and availability issues.

It might seem that JS may not be your ideal solution. or is it?
In this talk, I’ll show you how microservice can break with big data.
More importantly, I’ll show you how you can work on big data with Node.js Streams while keeping your dream JS job.
