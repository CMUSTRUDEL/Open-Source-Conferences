Description: 
	Cloud is eating the (software) world. More and more teams, companies and organizations are building their infrastructure and applications on AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud. Once you start exploring the abyss that is AWS and their diverse range of services it's clear that it's a *whole new world* to explore.

What if there was a way for us, web developers, to translate our existing skills into the world of AWS and use them to harness the power of S3, Lambda, DynamoDB and all the other services?

AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) makes it possible - in this talk we're going to learn how we can use CDK to define, build and provision infrastructure on AWS using TypeScript! After watching this talk you'll be on your way to become an even-fuller-stack developer - backend/frontend/infra, everything can be built with a single programming language - TS.
