Title: How to build a house in 3D: a short introduction to BabylonJS - Anna Backs & Christina Zenzes
Publication date: 2019-06-11
Playlist: JSHeroes 2019
Description: 
	Who has not dreamed of creating something in 3D, or even better: 3D running in a browser?! We also had this dream, and during a hackathon in early 2018 we finally fulfilled it by using BabylonJS. We started to build an interactive control panel for managing all IoT devices in our office building. Having had no prior experience whatsoever, we got to know the framework by working with it and having to fix our own mistakes. In this talk we, will share our experiences using BabylonJS and show you how to get started with building 3D web applications. We will cover all the basics needed to implement a small 3D web app with BabylonJS.

00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,540
thank you very much we were already in

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,010
use I'm Anna this is my colleague

00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,900
Christina we are both software

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,880
developers and consultants working for

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,710
concentric and Germany but that's more

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,990
than enough about us what I'd like to

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,390
know is who a few has ever thought of

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,580
building something in 3d but maybe for a

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,519
reason or another didn't and yes that

00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,290
creates a few about one and a half years

00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,930
ago Christina and I were at that same

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,790
spot and today we want to show you how

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,760
to get started actually doing that and

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,690
for that we use bubble ingest first we

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,850
are going to talk a little bit about

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,980
what babylons is actually is and how it

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,200
works and then we are going to build a

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,360
small world step by step and at the very

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,809
end of it going to show a live demo

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,120
fingers crossed for that so first what's

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,579
Babylon giant let me go on the website

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,009
of Babylon J as this is what we see

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,420
Babylon J as describes itself as a

00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,039
complete JavaScript framework for

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,100
building 3d games and experiences with

00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,590
html5 web GFF we have web audio or as

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,229
I'd like to say it's the 3d game engine

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,020
that runs in your browser which is very

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,520
neat Babel Andreas is an open source

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,880
JavaScript framework that has been

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,229
around since 2013 and at the end of the

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,500
month they are going to release a new

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:32,009
major version version 4 and so now let's

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,440
get right into it how does it work we

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,450
have three basic thing the things that

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,880
we need to think about the first is the

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,539
engine the engine is like a happy little

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,190
painter that needs a canvas and of

00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:46,050
course it needs something to paint and

00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,310
then babylons is that is called a theme

00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:53,849
that can be whatever you want and today

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,920
this will be a house and this happy

00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,890
little painter is a very very fast

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,520
little dude he paints the scene 60 times

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,590
every second onto the canvas and since

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,410
it's running in the browser and so we of

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,479
course need some sort of canvas inside

00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,770
an HTML document and the important thing

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,209
is we give it an ID bubble on canvas and

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,239
so let's get started with actual

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,910
JavaScript the first thing we do is we

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,680
create an eight-game function and inside

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,740
of this function the first thing we do

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,750
is we actually grab our canvas by the ID

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,420
we assigned

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,970
obviously we are going to initialize our

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,130
engine and our scene and to get

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,160
everything running we tell it to hay

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:40,070
loop around and please render our scene

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,850
the last thing of course is we start

00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,340
everything so let's go on from there and

00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,140
actually start building but we still

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,330
can't control the screen we do not know

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,250
where are we looking at the skin what we

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,260
are going to do the skin how we changed

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,050
its position of the skin that's done

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,420
actually by camera but at first let me

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,400
explain you something about Batman J's

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,650
Bob FASS written in typescript so

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,970
everything is a class and most classes

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,040
are following the same pattern for the

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,989
constructor it always starts with a name

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,640
you can give it somehow some name and

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,800
then you're going to put the options

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,270
inside if it starts one value it would

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,470
be already the value but if you have

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,900
more than this you're going to use the

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,550
option object and then you must say hey

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,500
it belongs to the skin actually when you

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,690
have only one skin you do not need to do

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,730
that but if a multi-bit skin you must

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,989
say hey it's belong to this scheme so

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,610
that's the standard pattern which you

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:31,790
will always see doing our complete talk

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,860
so back to the cameras so how do we

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,269
going to find which part of the skin we

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,190
are going to see and how we can control

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:38,480
the skin it's done by cameras and we

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,519
have here one the universal camera

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,260
actually this camera controls the skin

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,209
by using the arrow keys so if I push

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,860
left I'm going to the left side if I

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,650
push the red arrow key I would go to the

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,900
right side and you have forward and

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,420
backward the same so how does this look

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,860
in the code at first again we use a

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,930
class for that because it's type script

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,090
so the class is actually called

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,579
universal camera like the camera squad

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,560
and then to give it a name and then you

00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:05,980
given it a position where it should stay

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,660
in your scheme and edit to the scheme

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,040
okay but still we didn't define where

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,989
we're going to look with the camera and

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,190
that's by done setting the target and

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:14,840
now we're going to set it by the

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,690
receiver vector so it looks always in

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,609
the center of our scheme but we can

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,280
control the screen at the moment that's

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,100
done by camera attached to con attached

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,540
to control so we say hey this canvas you

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,180
should control by your arrow keys and

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,630
set it to true so it's always going to

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,490
control it but just one camera that

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,919
would be set there more commerce

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,570
depending which use case you have for

00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,189
example there's the equitation camera

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,319
the occupation

00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:45,139
actually a camera which always looking

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,899
on the same point of your skin but we're

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,179
trading around the sky around a point in

00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:52,969
the skin so how are we going to

00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:55,819
implement it again we're using a class

00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:57,649
we give it a name we're going to say how

00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,959
much it should weight hood on this beta

00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:01,879
alpha part which you're going to see on

00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:05,239
the picture and then we're going to say

00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,729
how far away from the center the camera

00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:10,189
should stand and then we must editor the

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:14,419
skin again and we do also do need to

00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:17,269
attach it to control but we still don't

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,189
see anything on the screen right without

00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:21,080
light everything is still black on the

00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,300
skin it's like we're like in the real

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,369
world so what are we going to do we're

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,749
going to add a light in this case we're

00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:28,969
going to start with the simple slide

00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,069
which we have the point light the point

00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,409
light is actually light which do have a

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,809
point like the name set and it's emit

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,050
the light completely from this point to

00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:41,779
all directions which we have yeah that's

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,839
what the point let us so how it does it

00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:47,659
look and cut again we have a class we do

00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,519
have the name again but we do define now

00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:52,639
at the options part we are the pointers

00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,679
and we added to a scheme then you have a

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,579
light on your screen but how about the

00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,079
different lights something like a

00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,050
spotlight which you have something like

00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,999
here on the pot rooftop for that we

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,139
could use the spotlight class and it

00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,789
actually a bit a little different it

00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,550
also have a point we're going to start

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,499
but it gives you a scatter values where

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,949
you can say oh it should be spreaded

00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:15,979
like this like a pool for example and

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,769
then we need to give it a direction in

00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,149
which directions light will show you and

00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:22,819
also intensity it should be something

00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:24,319
like 10 meters or 2 meters depending

00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:29,419
what you really want to do with the diet

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,699
and encode again we use a class we give

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,259
it a name we say where the point is

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:36,229
we're going to say in which direction

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,869
light should be emitted how far the

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,789
scatter values should be and how much

00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:45,289
the intended years for this kind of

00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:46,849
light and yeah we have light yeah so we

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,979
have a light and we have a camera to be

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:52,090
and so we can actually see something now

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,290
but our scene still is very very empty

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,080
and that's where we begin to use

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,810
measures a mesh is basically a bunch of

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,880
triangles that create a shape and I know

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,290
that looks quite complicated but the

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,169
good news is we do not need to create

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,730
those ourselves Babylon's is already has

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,470
a thing called mesh builder which we are

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,350
going to use and the mesh brother offers

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,600
all basic shapes and there's lots of

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,639
online resources of very complex

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,070
measures that you can just use for

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,350
everything you need and of course once

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,210
we have created our mesh and the world

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,370
we need to think about where we are

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,410
going to position it and babylons is

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,330
there's this thing called world axis I

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,660
think it looks similar to what we had

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,950
and geometry class back in school and

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,260
these world axes have an origin point

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,870
that's defined by the vector zero zero

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,520
zero and when we create a mesh and this

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,950
time this tiny little mustache it's

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,990
created in the origin point so zero zero

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,930
zero and if we want to move it around we

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,389
need to give it a vector and then the

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,820
mustache will magically move to where

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:55,660
the vector points of course we can also

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,310
rotate objects and for the rotation it's

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,130
important to know that each and every

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,050
mesh also has their own local axis with

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,830
the center point that's the zero zero

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,020
zero vector of the local axis and to

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,289
rotate that we again assigned a vector

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,380
this time radiant vector and the mesh

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:17,380
magically begins to rotate this is quite

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,840
easy to do let's just create a simple

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,630
box just like before we have our class

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,669
create box I already talked about the

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,250
mesh builder then we give it a name just

00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,380
simple box we have a couple of options

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,990
that you find the size of the box and

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,150
this type in this case we have a simple

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,750
cube and then of course we give the

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,719
scene to the box next we can put the

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,089
position we can address X epsilon and

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,450
set both separately but we can also just

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:51,160
give them a whole vector of three data

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:54,310
points and we have the box we move the

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,320
position we rotated the little box but

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,570
it still looks very very boring doesn't

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
it and in order to make it more

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,100
interesting we use this link called

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,050
materials a material is basically like a

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,870
perfect skin that wraps around you

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,600
- without any sticky hands pointing up

00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,190
or whatever and when we think about

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,959
materials there are three important

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,200
color types that we need to take care of

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,420
the first color is the diffuse color the

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,940
diffuse color is like the color of the

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,029
object itself like my shirt would be

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,950
black and then there's the specular

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:30,000
color that's like the highlight color if

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:33,100
a spotlight would light directly at that

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,220
object that's the color that would

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,930
appear like my bracelet is shiny so the

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,600
specular color would be a light silver

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,029
my pants are not shiny so it wouldn't

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,529
have a specular color the last color is

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,350
the emissive current the emissive color

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,959
is the color that if the object were to

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,880
shine itself like a lightbulb that would

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,519
be the color that we see but with

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,160
materials you can also influence the

00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,890
texture absorb the objects that we see

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,010
like we can make it appear like grass or

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,620
wood or stone or whatever and the good

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,300
thing is Babylon is also is very

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,640
supportive when it comes to materials we

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,170
can just say hey please give us a new

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,990
standard material which we call material

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,390
we said diffuse color we set the

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,130
specular color and then we just assigned

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,160
the material to our books and we are

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,260
done we have a colorful box but now that

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,360
we have the box we also want to interact

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,790
with it right we want to make it

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,920
clickable for example and for this

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,660
Babylon dress has this nice thing called

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,160
actions and when it comes to actions we

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,620
need to think about two things the first

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,110
thing is the action type the action type

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,209
can be something like set value play a

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,380
sound a please execute this block of

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:46,510
code and Babylon jazz has a set list of

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,640
different action types that we can draw

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,110
upon the other thing that we need to

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,029
think about is of course the trigger

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,010
that can be something like hey I click

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,649
the box or I double click the box or I

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,420
press this key again Babylon dry-ass has

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,870
a whole list of things that we can just

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,459
use so in order to make our object

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,370
lickable we need to define an action

00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:08,680
manager on our object and then combine

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,970
the action with the action manager this

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,399
sounds a lot more complicated than it

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,500
actually is because in source code all

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,630
that we need to do is like I said we

00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,640
define the action manager on our box and

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:23,320
then we register and

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,240
action with our action manager in this

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,090
case we are just having an execute code

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,890
action and we set the unpick trigger and

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,080
the unpick trigger means I click the box

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,540
and something happens and what I want to

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,940
happen is I want to have a lock message

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,800
that tells me yes I clicked on the box

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,110
and I want to assign the material that

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,330
we just defined so if we go back into

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,730
the browser and click in our box this is

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,530
what we see our box is no longer boring

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,720
gray but it's like a happy minty green

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,650
and we of course have the lock message

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,480
hey I clicked on the box but we told you

00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,880
we don't want to build the box we

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
actually want to build a house right so

00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,790
let's do that

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,140
so before we could build a house we must

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,980
cover the basics which we have already

00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,450
done now so let's build a house I would

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,340
say a house nobody has some kind of

00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,770
wards so I'm going to use a box for that

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,380
and say yeah I do have obscure pubs at

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,940
the moment so I'm created I do not like

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,490
grey houses so I'm giving you the

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,040
texture for example yellow house texture

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,930
and I think my house needs at least

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,610
something like a roof so I'm going to

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,590
use another mesh which we haven't seen

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,450
before the cat put it on actually it's

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,000
create some kind of diamond which you're

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,010
going to set on the top of the house but

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,020
it's also grey I do not like red stuff

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,850
so I give it a color for example wet in

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,060
this case I going to change the position

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,130
of the diamond because it's now still in

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,650
the center of the box because each mess

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,990
you going create is always at the vector

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,970
seo seo seo normally so you must change

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,890
the position of it and I won't write

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,550
hurt a little bit so that it foot would

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:56,200
fit on the house so how does it look it

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,450
looks like this so we have ours

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:04,090
yay you could have multiple houses yay

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:07,360
but still that's pretty boring and I do

00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,210
like rubber ducks so why not let it snow

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,220
weber rocks how I going to do that I'm

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,830
going to use a particular system a

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,840
political system is actually based on 2d

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,120
sprites for example here my rubber duck

00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,860
and the emitter from which my rubber

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,650
duck is going to emit it in some kind of

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,050
direction now it goes down if I said

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,490
just this single point I want to have a

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,280
little bit more spreading around the

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,140
emitter so can we find a box in which I

00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,670
said okay

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,550
here you're going to omit all my works

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,220
you can even change the size of it and

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:41,000
now you get rapid axe waning from the

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,110
steam but how does it look in code

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,880
you're going to use a particular system

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,470
and say hey how much particular I want

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,170
to use in this case I want to have two

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,500
thousand web attacks but I think I still

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,730
two less products we could use more then

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,279
I must tell them that it should actually

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,100
use my web attack extra by saying that's

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:03,510
my particular texture I must say where

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,519
the emitter is located and I would want

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,870
to have recovered my complete skin so

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,880
I'm going to sit the emitter box a

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,070
little bit further than it actually is

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,769
so it's now covering my complete screen

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,630
and actually I do want to have the

00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,940
rubber ducks falling down like Wayne so

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm given them in gravity vector and all

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,029
my attacks are put in this kind of

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,670
direction you're going to see that

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:25,079
there's a negative why were you so it

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,320
goes down if I would put a positive

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,930
inside of this it would go up and I must

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,140
said how much rubber duck should be

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,890
emitted at one time so my case 999 but

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,209
still also to this and yeah we won't see

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,459
anything at the moment if we would

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:43,529
executed it why because we must add a

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,570
particle system that's something we're

00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,190
going to do then if you want to stop it

00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,750
you can also call it by a particle

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,310
system stuff okay so now we have a house

00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,769
and we have rubber ducks raining from

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,470
the sky but in the beginning I said

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,540
Babylon chess is a game engine so what

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,829
else can it do well in a game we

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,709
probably want to have something like

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:07,440
animation and yes Babylon jazz can do

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:10,320
that it also has a whole list of special

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,790
effects that you can use for example you

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,709
just need a few lines of code and then

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,100
you have a ground that's like boiling

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:19,529
lava or you can create that the

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,500
feature that I have come to value a lot

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:24,600
as the debug layer you can watch that

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,310
every step of you seen you have all

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,769
sorts of parameters that you can look at

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,870
that you can play around with in order

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:34,680
to figure out what's going wrong or

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:37,290
where to improve and before we go to the

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,680
demo we of course want to talk about why

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,600
should you use it and for me it was very

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,600
very easy to get started with Babylon

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,330
draya's

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,950
has a lot of online resources the

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,440
documentation is almost always

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,090
up-to-date they have a nice playground

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,710
where on one side you have your source

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,660
code and on the other side you directly

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,320
see what's happening and you can just

00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,330
play around with it and of course it

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,160
runs in a browser so when I create

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,140
something nobody needs to install

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,090
anything they just type in the URL they

00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,750
had enter and they see what I have built

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:13,780
and the great thing is it's very very

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:15,310
extensive there's a lot of function a

00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,770
lot of features and we've only just

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,950
talked about very few of them but of

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,500
course when something is that extensive

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,860
it can be quite daunting to get started

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,900
with it and sometimes it's just too much

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,480
functionality for what I want to do and

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,430
of course since it's running in a

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,070
browser there are just some limits with

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,830
that we cannot surpass and so in some

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,250
cases Babylon is just isn't the right

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:44,020
thing for what you want to do but in our

00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,680
experience it's a very very great thing

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,600
and there's definitely a learning curve

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,670
at least for us when we started using it

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,710
for our project we had quite some

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,540
trouble with performance but the more we

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,040
did it word it with it the more we

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,890
learned about it the more we understood

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,700
it the easier it was for us to improve

00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,070
on the performance as well and the the

00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,579
community and the resources are just

00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:25,209
great and very very helpful so now let's

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:27,850
actually get to our demo so all the

00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,370
sales code is also on git we will post

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,800
the link later on and that's the wrong

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,700
field I need to be down there in order

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,240
to actually start it up and I typed an

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,200
are too much so there we are and if we

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
go into the browser

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:58,350
we have our small little world with

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,520
robotics stilt and remember the little

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,900
cube we talked about that was

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:07,010
interactable this should be that one

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,620
there we have it

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:12,690
sue with Babylon dress we told you we

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,290
can do a lot more for example we could

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,670
boot put in a height map yeah if you

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,560
start trying with something like this

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,300
normally a playground is some small

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,740
anymore because you said I want to have

00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,630
this feature I want to hear this pitch

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,060
and we want to have a ground because Oh

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,540
houses don't fly in the air so we put

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,330
the ground on it and actually we do have

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,400
something more yeah we also built in

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:41,010
some gravity we can show you the source

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,600
code as well just put it in there I'm

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,040
gonna resize it a little bit so we have

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,850
the source code on the other side and

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,520
there we see a ball falling down which

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,900
thanks to the gravity so in the

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,790
beginning we talked about the inner game

00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,130
method that we can see here we have our

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,260
canvas our engine and our theme we

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,390
define the light and the application

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,130
camera the application camera was this

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,390
satellite like thing that was always

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,160
directed to one point in the scene so

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,100
like you see we can actually watch it

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,080
from all sides but it's always directly

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,080
looking at the center of our scene and

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,520
this is the create hate map do you want

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,690
to talk about that yeah actually what

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,880
you just don't have time something like

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,640
10 minutes so we can do that I hope you

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,800
can all read it yeah we should probably

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,960
make it a little bit bigger I'm sorry I

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,960
didn't think of that before I don't know

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,670
how do we make it bigger actually it's

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,130
just a different kind of mesh which we

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:44,250
are using it's a plane so it's just like

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,780
a paper and what you're going to see

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,300
there is we're going to make a plane

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,620
based on a height map which we found

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,320
somewhere on the internet by Wikipedia

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:55,240
and put it on top of it and also put

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,740
some kind of texture on a tripod so it

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,160
looks a little bit different and some

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:04,030
spots and yeah it's great that it's

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,450
better but that's physics that's another

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,570
story

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,970
hey yeah actually it looks pretty easy

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,710
and is you just import the height map

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,480
from a path which we have power as in

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,150
there are like local set up we're going

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,730
to set how wide and height after the

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,890
plane and say how much subdivided it so

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,990
when we start going to subdivided we

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,940
just get off that plane but we won't

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,830
really want to have the small mountains

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,310
on top of it so we're going to stop

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,330
divided in more sub measures actually

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,680
yeah and we're going to set the height

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:40,630
if we would increase bhai

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:43,720
yeah please it would look like this so

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,020
more like Willie strange mountain from a

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,290
lot of three wings I would say but we

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,850
could make it again back to normal

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,490
that's actually how a height map is

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,860
working and we do have this little ball

00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,280
which is still jumping around that's

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,990
based on gravity and we're still a bit

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:07,090
apart and you think it was above her

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:09,070
yeah so you must enable gravity on a

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,810
branch is there are different kinds of

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,280
drive away under the hood super branches

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,690
is actually not implementing it it's

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,210
using other lobbyists which are pretty

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,760
great like Romeo yet and this kind of

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,170
stuff and yeah we need to some stuff to

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,230
interact so we're going to create a

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,420
sphere and the sphere normally doesn't

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,580
know that it's continuing some gravity

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,830
stuff so going to put an imposter impact

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,260
object onto the sphere and saying you

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,450
will know some kind of physical checked

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,570
and this imposter object actually hurts

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,980
our physic that has what you need and

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,450
yeah again we use affair so we're going

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,250
to use the physic and Porter for that

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,320
we're going to say the mass of this

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,930
stuff so for example this is two

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,650
kilograms and we just say with the

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,500
restoration

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,780
how much junk it is toughest so this is

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:57,490
really jumpy but our bottom plane isn't

00:21:52,780 --> 00:22:01,240
jumpy but we can make a champion now we

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,980
should see a ball there which is jumping

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,730
really high back and low and back and

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,710
low and again again until it

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,240
stops probably in this example it will

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:13,549
never stop yeah and that's actually how

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,480
gravity is working you need at least two

00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:19,370
objects so that you can collide them and

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,500
see the effects of gravity prove out it

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,650
would be really boring to just see your

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,340
ball falling down and the jumping effect

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:30,110
is a little bit better than this yeah

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,570
and I think we also mentioned we could

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:47,419
make the ducks fly upwards oh yeah we

00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:48,860
can have a look at that system I'm not

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,470
sure if you can see that oh yeah and

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:55,580
then got it up so low they are flying

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,090
away mm-hmm and to be honest for me it's

00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,510
to this robotics let's make more rubber

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:07,880
ducks

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:10,100
oh yeah that's sometimes septums you can

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,140
go under the skin like always but you

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,669
can also restrict it that's one of the

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,679
great things about Babylon is in the

00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,330
beginning it just sets a lot of default

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,260
values for you but once you get to know

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,870
it more you can set a lot of variables

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,309
for yourself and then for example

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,770
restrict the camera so that it wouldn't

00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:30,679
be able to actually go beneath the scene

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,450
or can't go above the scene for whatever

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,450
reason you might want to do that and

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:44,179
yeah so I would recommend giving Babylon

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,340
is a try and when you do so please have

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,780
fun with it and go get ready with it if

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,419
you want to have thousands of rubber

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:54,740
ducks flying up or down or wherever just

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:56,090
do it and that's about it we will be

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,450
around for the conference if you have

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,360
any questions or if you want to see more

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:06,620
stuff that we did please just seek us

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,570
out or ping us up on Twitter and we will

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,840
post the slides and all the codes later

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,840
on

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:22,699
[Applause]
