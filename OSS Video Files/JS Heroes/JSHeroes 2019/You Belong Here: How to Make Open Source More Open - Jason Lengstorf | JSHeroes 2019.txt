Title: You Belong Here: How to Make Open Source More Open - Jason Lengstorf | JSHeroes 2019
Publication date: 2019-04-30
Playlist: JSHeroes 2019
Description: 
	Done well, open source is one of the highest-value targets for businesses these days. Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies â€” and even if they _do_ open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch â€” because they're missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.

Projects that survive in today's landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source _and_ the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including:

Offering open pair programming hours
Trusting _all_ contributors with merge access
Sending free swag to contributors
And much more!
Learn how you can borrow our strategies to create a healthy, welcoming community for your open source projects, starting today!

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,830
hello everyone

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,560
I know it's after lunch everybody wants

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,920
to nap so I'm gonna use my deep soothing

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,630
voice in case you want to sneak some in

00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,800
while we while we wait for the next talk

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:36,010
I am gonna be talking today about open

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,760
source as you heard my name is Jason and

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,830
I work at Gatsby my official title is

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,410
the head of developer relations but my

00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,269
unofficial role is human duct tape I do

00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,830
a little bit of everything there and I

00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,409
love it it's actually what I love to do

00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:52,960
because open source especially in a new

00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,699
company is very chaotic and so you get

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,979
to try all sorts of things you get to do

00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,049
sales you get to do developer relations

00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,610
you get to I got to draw a picture of a

00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,839
guinea pig and I'm not gonna tell you

00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,839
why you're just gonna get surprised when

00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:08,260
I post it on Twitter used to work at IBM

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,670
and I'm living in Portland Oregon and I

00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,080
want to talk about why open-source

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,990
matters why it's such an exciting thing

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,299
open source adds value in so many

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,189
different ways I mean just like first it

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,479
just powers so much of the Internet if

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:26,890
you look at WordPress which is powering

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,229
close to 30% of the Internet

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,020
you've got react which is everywhere

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,240
you've got Drupal which is everywhere

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,530
angular jQuery bootstrap like these are

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,380
open source projects that have played

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:43,030
such a huge role in either the current

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,100
or development of the web we get so much

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,829
value from that like who here is not

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,799
using open source at their job like zero

00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:52,090
open source that's what I thought I mean

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920
it's it's just everywhere like it's it's

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,890
doing something for almost everyone in

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,090
development now open source is also

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,100
really good for business like if you are

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,829
a business there is a business strategy

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,039
for having open source as a core part of

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,479
your business you can first use it to

00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,460
build your business you can leverage the

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,250
collective knowledge of thousands of

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,380
developers you also get to do some like

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,569
good for the bottom line things you get

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,060
to offload a lot of the maintenance and

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,680
overhead to the community people in the

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,180
community are gonna volunteer to solve

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,480
your bugs because you're using an

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,310
open-source framework if you're a

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,110
company like Airbnb or Facebook you can

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,459
build a lot of goodwill for the

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,280
community and you know if you're a

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,489
company like Facebook you're you kind of

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,069
need that goodwill right like you so

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,260
like I mean react is such an interesting

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,270
project because most of the developers

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,160
that I know who work on react are kind

00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,580
of like actively repelled by Facebook as

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,870
a platform but they love react and it's

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,190
just it's interesting like that's the

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,630
power of open source right it can make

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:56,980
you use an evil Megacorp

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:59,019
software because it's just that good it

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,000
can also rehabilitate your your company

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,560
image like I don't know if anybody

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,630
remembers what what it used to be like

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,340
to talk about Microsoft but it was like

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,720
if you were like oh yeah I work at

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,470
Microsoft and this is ten years ago

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,760
people go I'm so sorry for you you tell

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,019
you people that you work at Microsoft it

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,640
I mean like half the speakers on the

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,870
stage they work at Microsoft we're super

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,590
stoked to see him it's like well you've

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,239
worked at Microsoft

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,430
that's amazing they're hiring everybody

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,900
cool and I think that's because they

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,049
decided to focus on open source as a

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,780
company that's that's really that's

00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,430
that's pretty transformative and it also

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,769
if you have open source as a core focus

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,420
either using it or building it you have

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,120
the ability now to attract some of the

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:40,239
most engaged and talented people in the

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,400
ecosystem you know if you work at react

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,680
you get to recruit somebody like Dan

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,970
Abramov onto your team because that's

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,910
what he wants to do he wants to work on

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,910
react you get to recruit people who just

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,829
love working on these really cool fun

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,630
open problems and giving back to the

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,760
community that's good marketing that's

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,310
good recruiting that's it's like good

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,709
all the way around open-source is also

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,880
really good for developers if you're a

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,950
developer and you work on open source

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,959
you don't have to have a job to create a

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,970
body of work you can just release

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,280
projects you can contribute to another

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,810
project and you can start to build a

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,180
reputation you can start to build that

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,739
resume build your CV get to the point

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,940
where people you know it doesn't matter

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,190
that you don't have an actual job

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,340
history you've got a proven track record

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,930
of doing great things on the web you can

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,000
build a referral network for paid work

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,100
if you are a prolific open source

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,520
contributor your consulting pipeline can

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,780
stay full and it can stay very full you

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,099
can turn it into a sustainable source of

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,830
income we're gonna hear from Henry next

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:40,479
who's making a full-time living building

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,170
open source and he's not the only one

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,030
that's really

00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,670
that's a really powerful model however

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,780
let's get sad for a minute

00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,630
getting started an open source can be

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,760
pretty daunting if you've been around

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,310
open source for a long time you may

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,410
remember Linus Torvalds who is kind of

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,870
infamous for being super rude as a

00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,790
maintainer and I'm kind of picking on

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,380
Linus he actually did apologize and said

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,750
he's gonna work on the way he treats

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,980
people which I like I laud him for that

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,900
because I think it's great that he

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,370
recognized that it's a problem and it

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,040
shows a good shift you know you see

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,450
people like Linus Torvalds you see

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,790
communities like Stack Overflow who are

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,760
classically kind of looked at as not

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,480
that inclusive or friendly making public

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,220
commitments to solving that problem and

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,780
that's really good but doesn't change

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,880
the fact that a lot of projects still

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,340
aren't and you can still feel pretty

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,220
stupid if you show up in a in a project

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,230
and people aren't nice to you

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,940
open-source projects themselves can just

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,710
be really intimidating they are

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,170
sometimes thousands or tens of thousands

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,300
lines of code you've got tons of

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,560
required context years of history people

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,770
who have been working on these projects

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,270
for so long who are not you know you

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,170
don't have time to necessarily learn all

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,420
of that you want to make a contribution

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,860
but like do you really have the the

00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,210
months that it would take to gain the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,450
context to put like meaningful

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,130
contributions in you also have to use

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:07,210
git and like I love get I think get is

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,620
one of the most powerful tools out there

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,090
but you have to learn how to use it and

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,170
that's that I mean that can be a steep

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,880
learning curve if you've never done it

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,190
before I sincerely hope that you put

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,510
that work in but if you're trying to get

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,700
into open-source and you want to like

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:22,660
build a website and contribute to a tool

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,820
like you shouldn't have to want to build

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,710
a website and then learn a whole other

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,320
system and ecosystem and a bunch of

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,220
boilerplate to be able to do some HTML

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,600
on the web right so you know it's it's a

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,020
thing that you have to do it kind of

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,630
sucks but it's it's it's just another

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,010
hurdle that you got to come over github

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,990
itself can be a little confusing

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,790
I still get confused sometimes trying to

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,060
figure out which branch is which when

00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm opening a pull request I don't know

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,840
is I open them backwards half the time

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,460
I'll open a pull request against like my

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,639
own fork and then I'm wondering why

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,139
you noticed it there all sorts of things

00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,850
that can get weird with github if you're

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,430
not super familiar with it and if you're

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,900
a first-timer like it's a pretty there's

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,669
a lot going on in there there's so much

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,759
to do on github and it can be really

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:12,280
really intimidating there's also just

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
social dynamics like it's awkward you're

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,069
walking up to a group of strangers and

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,110
saying like hi can I like touch your

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:21,490
stuff and that's that's not necessarily

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,880
something that a lot of people feel

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:30,099
comfortable doing you know I saw this oh

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,080
man I spelled things wrong there's this

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:34,479
tweet that I saw that just made me smile

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,310
so much and it's it's such a good take

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,750
on impostor syndrome and I'll read it

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,120
because I like it that much it says

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,449
impostor syndrome I am surrounded by

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,940
beings of impossible cosmic intelligence

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:49,780
also imposter syndrome I an incompetent

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,830
have tricked them all I love that it

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:57,460
makes me so happy you've also got kind

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,050
of a lack of support if you go into an

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,080
open-source project and the maintainer

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,050
is overwhelmed or you just doesn't have

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,820
a lot of interest in a community they

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,370
can be really rude and if you're a

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,889
first-timer that that can be like a

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,710
permanent damage this this person is

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:17,259
talking about they did a PR it was a

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,300
first PR maintainer just closed it and

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,740
said wrong and that was it they were

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,460
like okay well open-source is clearly

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,599
not for me that's not what we want

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,759
that's that's definitely not what we

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,710
want at all and really if you look at it

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,620
like open source is kind of a luxury if

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,649
you have time to work on open source

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,209
that's like you have to be able to set

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,469
aside time or you have to have a job

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:41,800
that will let you do that and not

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,630
everybody has that luxury you may not be

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,730
able to go to your job and then go home

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,470
and put four hours in in the evening or

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,060
work over the weekend you might have

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,770
kids you might have a second job you

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,570
might have a family earth or someone

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,890
that you need to take care of and or you

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,089
might just have a hobby like maybe you

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,540
just want to like wood work or something

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:05,170
you shouldn't have to do that like it in

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,329
it just you know it puts a puts it puts

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,259
a little bit of a strain on on people to

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,359
get into open source

00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:12,279
and sometimes we don't have that

00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:14,589
opportunity and if our jobs don't

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,790
support it where if you're working on an

00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,929
open-source project you need to fix

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,229
something and they won't let you

00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:21,489
prioritize making that fix upstream well

00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:23,019
then what do you do you just wait until

00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:27,069
the the maintainer finally gets around

00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,629
to it and so that's a challenge and a

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,589
really big problem is that a lot of

00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,509
people don't see themselves represented

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,009
an open-source at all you know when I

00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,329
open up github it looks like a mirror

00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,919
it's a bunch of white guys looking back

00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:40,509
at me for somebody who's not a white guy

00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,539
it can be a little intimidating to go on

00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:46,059
github because there are people who

00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:48,519
aren't white guys on there but not in

00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:51,699
near the numbers as of the the 20 and 30

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,289
something year old white guys and all of

00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:56,109
that added up all of those different

00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:57,309
hurdles can kind of lead to ask any

00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:59,229
question like as open source actually

00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:01,899
open or is it like only open to certain

00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:06,519
people who have certain like freedoms

00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:08,559
and privileges and that makes me sad

00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,269
like it really bums me out to think that

00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,230
open-source isn't actually as open as we

00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:16,959
thought so if we want to make

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,649
open-source open we need to be really

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,910
proactive in creating that community

00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,939
open-source is only as open as we

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,100
actively make it we need to reach out

00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,869
and welcome new key new contributors we

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,549
can't just say we're an inclusive

00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:32,049
project we have to go find those people

00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:34,449
and say hey we'd love to have you please

00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:37,299
come here please come work with us we'd

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,100
love to have you an open-source we also

00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:41,619
need to remember and empathize with

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,739
beginners this is a steep learning curve

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:46,509
development is hard I know that when I

00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:48,249
was first starting like I'm not a

00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:50,889
particularly emotional guy I don't cry

00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:53,439
often I got so worked up trying to learn

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,100
PHP that I wept at my computer I was so

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,019
mad I was like angry crying and I'd I

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,909
forget that because now when I look at

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,499
code you know it's like somebody who can

00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,269
just like sit down at a piano and play

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,589
like I can just write code and it makes

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,929
sense that's the language I speak now

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,879
but that wasn't true when I started and

00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:11,139
I have to remember that I have to

00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,309
remember that when somebody asked me a

00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,229
question that I'm like oh that's so

00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,549
obvious I can never say that to them

00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,350
it's not obvious to them until they've

00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,949
learned it and it wasn't obvious to me

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,880
until I learned it we also need to

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:23,920
invest in

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,330
unity is a primary measure of success if

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,850
you have a project if you are calling

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,770
open source something that you do the

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,510
community around your project needs to

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,800
be like number one or two on your list

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,030
of whether or not your project is

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,490
successful if you're not actively

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,620
measuring that and Counting that is part

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,890
of the success of your project you're

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,390
probably on a on a decline or you're not

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,570
gonna get as far as you could have if

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,800
you would focused on community and if we

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,870
don't focus on these things we're gonna

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,080
lose we're gonna lose so many brilliant

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,150
people who have so many good ideas and

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,220
so much talent and if we don't welcome

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,190
if we don't bring them in that's it it's

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,200
gone we lose it we lose an opportunity

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,370
to add more maintainer x' if you're a

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,530
maintainer on an open-source project

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,260
that is a tough job

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,520
people are coming in with problems they

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,190
have bugs they need help they have

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,300
questions they want features if you

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,980
don't have people who are willing to

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,750
volunteer and do that work and help you

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,150
out how many hours in the day

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,370
do you have like how how long before you

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,870
get completely limited by the amount of

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,230
hours you can physically spend at a

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,730
computer you have to grow horizontally

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,470
you have to add maintainer x' you have

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,820
to add more people and that requires

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,290
community you have to have people who

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,090
are willing to do that work who are

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,890
invested in it and who care about it and

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:43,480
they can't do that if you don't welcome

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,590
them in you also lose the ability to

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,720
build a support network if you're a

00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,430
maintainer and you're not bringing a

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
building your community not only do you

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,860
lose the ability to get people to do the

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,180
work but you don't have anybody to

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,240
empathize with you you don't have a

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,760
community like working remotely can be

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,530
really lonely but you at least have a

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,970
company most of the time you have people

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,710
like co-workers and people that you talk

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,740
to all the time if you're a maintainer

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:09,760
working remotely by yourself and you

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:14,880
have no community like you're just alone

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,880
all the time that's that's not fun

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,760
and things are really sad and that's the

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,760
end of my talking I'm kidding

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,600
fortunately we're seeing a really good

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,980
movement I have been really really happy

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,600
to see that there are welcoming

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,690
communities popping up all over the web

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,450
a couple of my favorites Seren started

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,500
code newbies I love this problem it's a

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,010
podcast it's

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,050
community it's a Twitter chat and people

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,310
are just so excited about code and they

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,630
post what they're learning and what

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,520
they're excited about they share their

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,320
problems and talk through them with each

00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,210
other in public so that it becomes this

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,610
public repository of amazing information

00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,340
you can search the code newbies hashtag

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,820
and just it's it's such a joyful

00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:00,850
community like it makes me so happy free

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,440
code camp is another one incredible

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:03,760
amount of resources if you're trying to

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,520
learn code you can just sit down at free

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,020
code camp and get like a full education

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,330
you can get to the point where you're

00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,040
employable without spending a dime and

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,800
with this amazing community of people

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,450
who are so excited about learning code

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,100
you've got a hundred days of code which

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,140
is another project I love you just do a

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,400
little bit of code every day and post it

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,830
in public what you're working on what

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,090
you're excited about and there's just

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,830
people who follow this hashtag and they

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,020
cheer each other on and I love it it

00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,000
makes me so happy

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,660
you've got company initiatives like

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,030
digitalocean

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,840
does hack tober fest every October and

00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,550
they just I mean it's it's like a small

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,410
incentive you get a t-shirt if you open

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,660
five pull requests but like oh my god do

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,810
I love that and projects from all over

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,240
put a hack Tober fest label on issues

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,220
that are good for first-timers and

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,660
people just devour them I mean we did it

00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,970
at Gatsby I think we have like a hundred

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,290
and fifty issues get closed it was

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,330
amazing it was like double what we

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:04,260
usually see for Gatsby open-source is

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,880
like the core of our business and our

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,340
open-source project is a hundred percent

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,720
powered by community if gatsby didn't

00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,400
have the community that it has if it

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,340
didn't have the people who love to use

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,020
it and share and work on it we'd be dead

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,340
in the water we never would have had the

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,690
ability to grow to where we are I

00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,060
wouldn't be on this stage talking to you

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,210
about Gatsby today I'd probably still be

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,550
at IBM and I'd be real sad about it

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,700
I'm kidding I liked IBM I just like this

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,700
better

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,850
Gatsby has a stated goal we want to be

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,310
the most welcoming most inclusive most

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,280
fun open-source project on the planet we

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,350
want everybody to have it gatsby pull

00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,670
requests in their name on github every

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,420
single developer we want you in there

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,070
and to do that we've kind of defined

00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,570
some core values as a company some

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,130
things that we really care about and it

00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,930
really mattered to us and we've got a

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,430
blog post if you if you want to google

00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,260
that it's Gatsby's core values you'll

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,650
find it but the one that I'm talking

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,970
about today is you belong here this is

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,740
one of our core values we deeply believe

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,750
that the community is gonna make or

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:15,550
break us as a company and when we say

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,930
community we mean you and any one of you

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,880
who just thought like that he doesn't

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,320
actually mean me no I mean you we

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,960
actually want literally every single

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,210
person to come in and join us and so

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,990
we've put so much work into making

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:30,340
gatsby welcoming and most of this is

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,590
something that if you're working on open

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,110
source or working in open source I would

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,120
love to see more of this get pulled into

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:39,040
every project and I'm happy to help

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,450
please reach out to me because you don't

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,980
have to just talk to me about Gatsby I

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,360
just like open source in general and

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,510
Gatsby just likes open source in general

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,980
so use us we have the ability to support

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,710
open source we would love to help you

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,110
get involved so we've done a handful of

00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,480
things to really focus on this we've put

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,920
in a code of conduct which we think is

00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,050
really important we actively enforce

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,160
this we do

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,780
very rarely do we ever have to do

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,160
anything but if somebody crosses the

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,720
line we just send them a message and if

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,040
they have done something terrible we

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,510
block them and kick them out but I think

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,030
we've had to do that once in years of

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,000
having this project open we've committed

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:17,550
to accessibility we are trying very hard

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,400
to meet the the minimum standards of the

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,720
WCAG 's accessibility requirements it's

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,100
a little bit harder because we have like

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,270
a bunch of community plug-ins that are

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,160
difficult to audit but we're doing our

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,990
best and we're working on that we just

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,370
hired marcy sutton to be the head of

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,740
learning and also an accessibility

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,540
advocate she is doing fantastic work in

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,330
that space and and helping call us out

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,530
on the stuff that we probably should be

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,490
doing better

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,540
and she's already made some great

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,100
improvements along those lines we have

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,630
put together extensive documentation

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,080
documentation is something that we

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,700
consider a kind of a first class

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,740
property we call it a product it's not a

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,680
thing that supports the product it is a

00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,550
product and that's I mean we hired Marcy

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,440
to own that that is her product we also

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,690
have a whole section of our Docs a top

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,040
level navigation item specifically about

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,780
contributing and there are a lot of

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,480
different things in here we've got you

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:13,090
know why you should contribute we've got

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,830
things about you know how you can get

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,370
involved different ways to participate

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:21,970
whether that is actually writing code or

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,940
if you want to do a grammar fix on our

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,230
Docs you want to talk into local meetup

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,060
about Gatsby you want to run a workshop

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,070
we have an open source workshop if you

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,330
just want to give a Gatsby workshop go

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,590
download those materials you can give it

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,600
tomorrow you don't even have to write it

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,990
we just want you to do anything you can

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,440
to get involved we also do a lot of

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,380
things

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,500
has anybody opened an issue on a open

00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,450
source repo can I see it show hands keep

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,260
it up if your issue got auto closed by

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:54,700
our robot I see a few hands keep it up

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:58,690
if that made you feel good I see one

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,790
hand back there so one of the things

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,030
that we've worked on is like Gatsby gets

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,990
hundreds of issues and not all of them

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,300
are issues that we're gonna have a

00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,500
chance to close and not all of them are

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,000
things that we have a chance to really

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,920
work on and sometimes we just don't know

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,450
what somebody's asked for and if we ask

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,020
for more information in it and it's it's

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,790
we do want to use a bot to close those

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,820
issues but a lot of times those bots are

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,960
just gonna say something like issue auto

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,680
closed due to inactivity like that's it

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,100
that doesn't feel good

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,990
it doesn't give next steps it doesn't

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,540
recognize the fact that somebody took 20

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,490
minutes out of their day to contribute

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,590
to your project by saying hey I'm having

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,470
an issue or I noticed a bug or whatever

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,940
it is I mean even if it feels like

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,010
they're creating work for you by opening

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,930
an issue they're giving back they're

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,910
participating because the worst thing

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,119
would be if nobody cared about your

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,859
project and

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,179
weren't opening issues and you never

00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,879
found out about that bug you could even

00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:57,969
get a chance to make the project better

00:19:54,879 --> 00:20:00,619
but if you don't have a chance to fix it

00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:02,449
we just you know we wanted to make the

00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:04,849
bot friendlier so we taught the bot to

00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:09,079
be nice and by that I mean we wrote some

00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:10,609
copy but we first we don't just Auto

00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,529
close we give you a warning we say hey

00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,819
it's a little quiet in here we haven't

00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:15,199
heard anything from you in a while is

00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,809
this still an issue for you or are you

00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:20,419
still working on this and if not we're

00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,549
gonna close this in 10 days and after 10

00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,969
days passes if nobody says anything then

00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:27,649
we post this message and this message is

00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:28,969
meant to explain what's going on to try

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,099
to show some appreciation that you're

00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:32,899
part of the community and to give you a

00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:35,269
next step if we closed your issue and

00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,319
you weren't satisfied if you'd you know

00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,309
if it's something that you actually

00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,599
didn't need help with and you just

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,879
didn't see it within the 10 day period

00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,709
we want you to open it again we're not

00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:44,599
saying like go away and never come back

00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:46,009
we want you to be here we just don't

00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:47,289
have time to do everything and so we

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,549
want to make sure that we don't have

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,839
thousands of open issues that aren't

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,959
moving

00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,549
you know that's stale issues can be they

00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:58,789
just add to the overload in a project

00:20:55,549 --> 00:21:02,929
and so you want to find a way to control

00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:04,999
that that's not alienating people we

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,849
also believe in just implicitly trusting

00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:09,289
the community so when you open a pull

00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,599
request as soon as that pull request

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:13,519
gets merged our robot is going to invite

00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,439
you to the Gatsby organization and

00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,539
you're gonna get invited to become a

00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:19,219
maintainer you get the ability to label

00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,499
issues you get the ability to merge

00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:23,119
certain types of issues we do use code

00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:25,579
owners to make sure that like core parts

00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,589
of the code don't don't accidentally get

00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:29,959
broken and we require certain teams

00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:31,429
which aren't all get to be employees by

00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:33,859
the way they're like community members

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:37,069
that are on those core teams that can

00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:40,369
merge those issues but we want people to

00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:42,139
be able to feel ownership over gatsby

00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:43,489
and we don't want to be gatekeepers if

00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:45,919
you want to be part of an open-source

00:21:43,489 --> 00:21:47,479
community if you want to manage issues

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,549
and make that something that you're

00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:51,049
doing we want you to be here and we

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,209
don't want to tell you that well you

00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:54,829
have to prove yourself to us like no

00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:57,049
we're gonna we're gonna trust you until

00:21:54,829 --> 00:21:59,329
you give us a reason not to and so far

00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:02,119
nobody has given us a reason not to we

00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:03,470
have a lot of contributors and the

00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:06,590
second part of this

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,429
that we also give people free swag as a

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:13,220
thank you for contributing and we do

00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,580
this by we just associate your your

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,950
github email address with with a coupon

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:22,390
code and Shopify and then you can go to

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,440
our Shopify store built in Gatsby and

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,760
you can log in with your github account

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,830
and will see that you have contributions

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,039
and then we will give you a coupon code

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,049
to download some free swag and we do

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,450
this because you know we don't want to

00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:36,799
introduce cash into the equation we

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,350
don't want to turn this and do like an

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,500
odd kind of mercenary situation where

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,450
you feel like we're valuing your time at

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,130
a certain dollar amount and and that

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,450
shouldn't be how open-source works and

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,210
it can't function that way it won't

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,850
scale but we definitely want to

00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,710
acknowledge you contributed like you put

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,020
timing you took time out of your day to

00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,510
do something whether it's a grammar fix

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,150
or a core feature or something in

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,919
between you were willing to volunteer

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,590
your time to make the community better

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,650
to contribute to this project and we

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,240
don't want that to go unnoticed so you

00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,100
know it's a it's a t-shirt it's a ten

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,110
dollar t-shirt or a hat or some socks we

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,130
just got dresses which I'm super excited

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:23,030
about stole that idea from Tracy Lee we

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,100
are like really happy to just give

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,929
something and to say thank you and to

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,080
make it easy for people to get into the

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,520
the gatsby community we do active

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,919
mentorship we open up a limited number

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,360
of one-hour pair programming sessions so

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,520
anybody who wants to get involved in

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,559
open-source can sign up for one of these

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,000
pair programming sessions and somebody

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,890
from the Gatsby team will jump on with

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,419
you and we'll just kind of work with you

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,620
on something the only thing that we're

00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,090
not going to work on you with is a

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,320
commercial project so if you're like I

00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,789
want you to solve this problem for work

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,440
we're not going to do that but if you

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,700
want to get started an open-source you

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,140
want her to your first pull request you

00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,820
want to get involved in gatsby core dev

00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,320
we will jump on a call and we'll walk

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,860
you through it we'll screen share and

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,429
and just help you get started and by

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:10,460
doing this we've been able to build an

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:12,890
incredibly active community we we have

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,310
around 500 pull requests and issues a

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:19,330
month in Gatsby right now

00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:21,320
which are our core maintainer czar I

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,080
don't know how they do it but they stay

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:27,140
on top of that they're some of the most

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,920
like welcoming and amazing people

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:33,890
because they can be nice and still close

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,390
this kind of volume of issues and I love

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,150
it because it we regularly see people

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,320
saying like wow I just merged my first

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,640
pull request to Gatsby and I can't

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,700
believe how welcoming that community is

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,210
and to me that's as good as getting my

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,740
paycheck because I've seen so many

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,630
people try to get involved in

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,220
open-source and I'll talk to him about

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,740
it and they go oh yeah it was so hard

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,850
like nobody responded to me or I didn't

00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,870
feel like I knew what I was doing I

00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,640
didn't know where to start

00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,000
I got stuck somebody told me I was wrong

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,620
and I just stalled out and so if we can

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,260
get you through that first contribution

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,630
if we can get you excited and give you

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,550
that first win so that you hopefully do

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,730
a second and a third and a 100th

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:17,900
open-source contribution to me that is

00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:19,940
the best possible outcome and you know

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,420
like I said Gatsby holds that at it as a

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,000
core value and so it matters a lot to me

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,400
but also like I get to put this as one

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,440
of my like core deliverables which is

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,750
why I like this job so much and why I'm

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,340
so excited about the ability to just

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,170
really double down on open-source since

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,660
we started doing this we've been able to

00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,180
add about eighteen hundred contributors

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,070
to the Gatsby repo we've got over a

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,160
thousand people in our maintainer zorg

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:51,260
who are all part of a you know you get

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,520
like a private message board and and all

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,800
those good things so that you can get

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,410
involved

00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,590
we are just absolutely in love with that

00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,230
because people who maybe would have

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,660
liked contributed once when they get

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,000
invited will see them like labeling

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,110
issues for us will see them adding like

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,910
a comment or a code review on a PR and

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,170
every single one of those is such a cool

00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,240
thing because we get another perspective

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,580
we get another piece of value and I

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,620
would just so strongly consider if

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,260
you're doing anything an open source

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,970
like look at this idea like how can you

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,580
get the community more involved how can

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,600
you make this part of what you do so

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,640
that you

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,100
to spread the spread the love around and

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,290
build that community that's engaged and

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,930
active it's gonna pay you back so many

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,000
times over now and not just in like

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,090
feeling good but it does feel really

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,740
good it's gonna pay you back in actual

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,030
time saved I mean every time somebody

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,700
goes in and labels an issue for us

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,840
that's two three minutes that we're just

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,760
kind of taken off of our plate and

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,740
whenever somebody goes in and does a

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,510
poll like app Laura Quest review that's

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,230
that's like twenty thirty minutes when

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:03,740
somebody opens a an actual like PR with

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,500
AK or change that could be ours we have

00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,020
people who have dedicated 20 30 40 hours

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,460
to building these projects because they

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,610
get excited and they feel like somebody

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,860
cares that they're doing that work and

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,390
you know you can leverage that in any

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,680
open source community you just have to

00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,170
be willing to put the work and to

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,640
welcome people and treat them really

00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:27,770
well to show them that they're

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,780
appreciated and that you care we have

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,900
kind of set a goal we want to live the

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,120
example of what it is to be a great

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,880
open-source community we want gatsby to

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,430
be the gold standard and we're setting

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,890
that up as you know from from my

00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,260
perspective the best possible outcome is

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,610
that when other people are starting

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,160
open-source projects we want them to

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,660
steal all of our ideas we want to become

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,830
the blueprint and that's why we open

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,510
source all this stuff if you want to set

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,760
up a swag store do it it's open source

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,940
you can clone it and start it tomorrow

00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,130
if you want to do our robot that's open

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:04,550
source you can clone Gatz bot and put it

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:07,940
in your project tomorrow and we would

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,140
love to have you join us as part of as

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,360
the open source community

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,240
I'm also very confused because I have

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,880
the wrong slides open here I had another

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,770
slide that was like a breakdown of all

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,900
this but ultimately to just recap I

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,940
would really love to see the entire

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,520
open-source community embrace this idea

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,480
of community first community is a

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:35,300
primary a primary metric and the way

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,710
that you do that is you have to be

00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,780
willing to do the work you have to

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,400
actively welcome people into the

00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,830
community you have to actively include

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,460
them you can't just wave you know say it

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,630
once and it

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,820
expect that people will show up you have

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:50,120
to seek them out and and say hello and

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,350
say please come you know come join us if

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,750
you want to have a great community you

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,980
have to lead by example you can't hope

00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,779
that people will follow a code of

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,620
conduct you have to follow that code of

00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:02,059
conduct you have to be the standard you

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,710
know you lead from the front an open

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:06,200
source in any community you have to lead

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,419
from the front and just you know

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,880
