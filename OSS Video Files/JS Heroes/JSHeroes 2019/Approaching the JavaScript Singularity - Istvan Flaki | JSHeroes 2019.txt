Title: Approaching the JavaScript Singularity - Istvan Flaki | JSHeroes 2019
Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: JSHeroes 2019
Description: 
	Developers are quick to complain about "JavaScript Fatigue", the perceived high volatility of libraries, tooling and the JavaScript language itself â€” yet very few look at these changes and additions as a whole. In this talk I will take some of JavaScript's new features with the biggest transformative potential (ES Modules, WebAssembly, the DOM-Node.js API convergence), and I try to showcase what they mean for web development and how, when used together, they are able to address various hurdles and complaints that have been plaguing Node.js & web development for a long time.
