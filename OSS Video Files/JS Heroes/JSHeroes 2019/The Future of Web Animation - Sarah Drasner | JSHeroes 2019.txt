Description: 
	We talk a lot about how to animate on the web, and what's possible in browsers today, but where is animation heading? In this talk, we'll start with some bleeding edge techniques such as native-like page transitions with client side rendering, but then we'll push it further. The intersection of health and animation with biofeedback sensors, the future of 3d in the browser complete with interviews with people who are writing these specs... this talk will show that in terms of animation on the web, we're just getting started.
