Description: 
	What if we took care of ourselves the same way we take care of our code?

As developers, we spend large amounts of time and energy making sure we are building the best solutions and learning the latest tech, but significantly less time on taking care of ourselves and others. Physical health problems are often very obvious. Mental health issues can be much harder to detect in yourself and others, but is essential that our community focuses on improving how we talk about and respond to them.

In this talk, I will share some personal experiences and lessons I've learnt about mental health, and suggest steps anybody can take to support those facing mental health issues. I will explain how we can best be supportive and break down the stigma that surrounds mental health.
