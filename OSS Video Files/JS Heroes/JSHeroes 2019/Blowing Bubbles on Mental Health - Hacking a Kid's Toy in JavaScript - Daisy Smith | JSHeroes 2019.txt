Title: Blowing Bubbles on Mental Health - Hacking a Kid's Toy in JavaScript - Daisy Smith | JSHeroes 2019
Publication date: 2019-04-27
Playlist: JSHeroes 2019
Description: 
	What if we took care of ourselves the same way we take care of our code?

As developers, we spend large amounts of time and energy making sure we are building the best solutions and learning the latest tech, but significantly less time on taking care of ourselves and others. Physical health problems are often very obvious. Mental health issues can be much harder to detect in yourself and others, but is essential that our community focuses on improving how we talk about and respond to them.

In this talk, I will share some personal experiences and lessons I've learnt about mental health, and suggest steps anybody can take to support those facing mental health issues. I will explain how we can best be supportive and break down the stigma that surrounds mental health.

[Music]

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,869
so hi I'm Daisy and today I'm going to

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,130
be talking about mental health I just

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,740
want to have a quick introduction about

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,110
why I'm doing this talk and midol for it

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,419
I didn't want to come up here and sort

00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,700
of present you with stats and videos

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:35,040
about how important mental health is and

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,079
how it's affecting our society instead I

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,309
wanted to share a bit more of personal

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,590
stories my experiences in life to help

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,640
sort of create some empathy for anybody

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,659
that hasn't dealt with these things

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,730
before and also try and break down the

00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,920
stigma that surrounds this just so you

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,129
know I am severely nervous right

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,379
now

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,600
when I am nervous I swear a lot I'm

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,609
really really sorry

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,179
well I am my pants obvious so I

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,830
don't gonna start so before I give a

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:05,880
talk I like to sort of tell you a little

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,860
bit about me so you know who's talking

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,299
to you I'm a software engineer at

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,260
domaine in Sydney Australia and

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,740
throughout my career I've always been a

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,690
creative develop for them I love solving

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,460
problems in creative ways using code to

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,900
bring joy and happiness into things so I

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,460
do that by night now

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,010
but also I'm not just a developer I'm

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,170
also a human being and I'm shy and quiet

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,520
but I'm also out during out drawing and

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,290
entertaining when I'm comfortable or

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,770
I've had a few drinks so after this I

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,930
will be quiet happy but yeah so

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,320
let's do it to it um so what is mental

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,980
health oh that's really awkward so what

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,230
is mental health

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,880
um it's generally considered anything to

00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,180
do with somebody is psychological or

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,250
emotional well-being and in saying that

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,310
there are always these two sort of types

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,220
that come associated with it

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,010
one is depression when my favorite

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,690
things to sit in it's a great dark

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,570
little place so much fun

00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,330
please sense my sarcasm as well and

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,250
anxiety this one really does get me so

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,200
 excited I have had this all

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,060
 day or wait leading up

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,819
to this conference it's made me really

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,250
rethink my decisions about putting my

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:22,440
proposal in for this talk but

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,720
it'll say that yes it's it's a fun time

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,950
but there's also a million other things

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,210
that you can be diagnosed with or

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,260
whatever you've been diagnosed with to

00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,640
do with mental health

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,010
some of the ones as well I know that I'm

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,470
still being diagnosed with I see my

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,200
doctors as well figuring out if I have

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,030
PTSD or association disorder but there

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,130
are a ton of other things that you can

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,020
have it is not all just depression and

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,750
anxiety and sometimes depression and

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,160
anxiety also comes in waves of it should

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,910
be very mild and it's also be very

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:58,380
severe but let's talk about what this

00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,060
can look like right usually we sort of

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,790
think of an image like this right doodle

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,760
search sad person sitting alone you know

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,710
alone and it's not wrong that is kind of

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,350
what it looks like sometimes it can also

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,090
be in body language the way somebody

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,200
holds themself up the way people are

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,270
watching torching yet and definitely be

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,580
in conversation I resonate with this one

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,560
a lot if I laugh at really inappropriate

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,600
 during this talk I am so sorry it

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,450
is just a part of it

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,209
but yes so sometimes you met some really

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,370
obscure jokes that people don't love it

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,900
but also it looks like this this is also

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,910
a photo of me

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,310
I think I looked quite happy I

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,850
was but this photo was also taken in one

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,350
of my most lowest depressive States and

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,380
I will talk more about that later but

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,880
there is why I show you that is because

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,989
we're all unique as individuals and it

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,760
will never look the same in everyone

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,520
mental health doesn't affect everybody

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,910
the same you'll have different ways of

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,080
dealing with it doing stuff I forgot my

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,200
point about what I was talking about but

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,750
I think I hid it and now I want to talk

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,920
about sort of the symptoms that you can

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,870
get when you have this and the reason

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,970
why I want to talk about this is to sort

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,209
of help educate but anybody that have it

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,450
hasn't seen it firsthand and also create

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:22,380
a bit of empathy not sympathy just

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:24,180
empathy okay so there are a wide range

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,740
of symptoms agent yet and which was were

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,140
all you need they are not the same

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,590
either so I'm mainly gonna be talking

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,210
about what I've personally felt so one

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,340
of them is this

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,680
that I can have my depression depressive

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,479
States and then BAM I'll have inside at

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,979
the same time this is this is some of

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,860
the funnest time at go ahead and laugh

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:47,520
those ones it should also look like this

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,160
what would face I have social anxiety as

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,740
well that really makes me myself so

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
make them made up last night that was

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,680
left oh okay there are also physical

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,430
side effects come with it as a result or

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,289
yeah just yeah but one of my favorites

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,490
is one of the oldest ones that I've had

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,110
since the very first time I got

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,020
diagnosed is this is me at 4:00 a.m.

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,300
with insomnia the should I do it for him

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,669
is just great life decisions get made

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,139
here we can think about these symptoms

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,229
as well about how this affects our

00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,729
day-to-day life imagine going to work

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,199
going into your meetings and trying to

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:25,560
function as a normal human being that's

00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,020
slept like the total eight hours it's it

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,870
sort of builds up so it's not that fun

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,900
alongside the insomnia comes massive

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,240
headaches in my brains absolute

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,590
confusion is a great one medicine was

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,000
touched on this to Italy because this

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,680
one comes with some great side

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,150
effects sometimes when you do get

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,639
diagnosed with a mental illness you can

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,720
get treatment with medicine and that's

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,710
totally fine if you do what you don't

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,159
it's your preference

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,050
really but in my face I've tried a few

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,909
different medicines I don't particularly

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,020
like some of them but I'm still swollen

00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:02,039
up

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,380
but yeah the I really wish that I should

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,599
have taken a picture of the you know

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,789
pamphlet that comes in like medicine

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,800
when you buy it right so in this size

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,720
four or six font whatever you want to

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,220
call it it's like a whole page of the

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,780
side-effects that you may or may not get

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,550
and then the ones that are severe it's

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,970
it's it's a really great read I

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,080
recommend it but some of them like I've

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,889
had so many difference I've had

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,330
constipation diarrhea nausea headaches

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,669
hallucinations you name it it's been a

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,810
fun time but I think the one that makes

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,090
me laugh and I'm not sure if this is

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,740
just because I'm a sarcastic human being

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,880
but is when the bigger ones that they

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,650
warn you about in the first three to

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,409
four weeks of taking some of these

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,150
antidepressants is the higher risks you

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,889
are of committing suicide when you are

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,909
already suicidal that made me laugh I

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,650
mean nobody's really laughing now

00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:50,760
because it's hot it's really awkward but

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,290
you know there we go yes so not nausea I

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,790
walked around all the time feel like I'm

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:59,040
gonna vomit you know it's very hard to

00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:02,160
see confusion this is also another one

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,120
I reviewed I have the worst memory in

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,620
the world right now I don't know if you

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,930
to notice with me looking at my slides

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,410
be like what the home stats but I

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,449
try to remember things I have done it to

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,940
the point where I forget things I can't

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:16,770
concentrate I think I'm repeating myself

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,150
but I have neurologists and MRIs that I

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,669
do it to to try and diagnose these

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,100
things better but yeah there's some of

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:24,240
things that obviously if you really

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
think about them they will it will

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,780
affect your day to day life especially

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,110
as programmers trying to solve buds and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:33,620
go to meetings and talk to people so

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,720
where can we get help

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,150
first off with professionals I recommend

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,070
going and seeing your general doctor not

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,810
sure what you call any Europe but yeah

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,389
just a family doctor and they can help

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:48,180
you set up a mental health plan and they

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,650
can sort of coach you and guide you into

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,080
maybe referring you to see a

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,690
psychologist that usually provide you

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,460
with some some good therapy which is

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,280
usually taught back I found it very

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,080
helpful also they can send it to

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,380
psychiatrists who can help diagnose you

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,770
further with more pinpointed lots of

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:12,090
mental illnesses but yeah in saying that

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,770
as well if you don't gel well with one

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,810
and you finally go and have the courage

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,070
to see one and this professional it's

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,250
not great and it doesn't fit with you

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,580
don't feel like you have to stay with

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,169
them shop around you're unique you're

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,289
not going to gel with the first person

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,840
yet I can happily say that in the last

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,630
year I have had seen about six to seven

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,390
different psychologists doctors you name

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,159
it just to find the right one so oh also

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,130
you shouldn't officered yet help from

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,919
the people around you it's also easier

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:47,029
to talk to people that you feel sort of

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,339
safe with already so family and friends

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,620
but yeah I can't stress enough how

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:56,610
important is to get help there's no

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,410
shame in doing that again I'll just

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,240
start talking about stigma

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,949
like what if we could help remove this

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,839
right just even if we're not suffering

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:09,069
from it we'd want to do it right so what

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,199
happens when these things come knocking

00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,459
at your door your friend tells you

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,360
something personal and it's telling you

00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:16,329
they're having a really downtime or

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,290
something like that I've noticed this

00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,660
day and age and I'm gonna tell your

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,379
story in a little bit is especially with

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,449
you know social media or you know modes

00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:28,000
of communication like slack

00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:32,560
I noticed you know we like to react to

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,639
things with emoticons right now please I

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
know I've put a lot of tips on this

00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:38,879
right remember whether to crop it down

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,129
but let me give you a bad story I Cho

00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,079
organize and run a little collective in

00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:46,060
Sydney called dev dev women and it's

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,959
just a bunch of female engineers where

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,389
we have a safe place to talk about

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,449
things share stuff whatever but for

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,939
World Mental Health Day I decided to use

00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,870
my story and just share it with some

00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,000
people that I felt safe and comfortable

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,470
with and this is what I wrote and I'll

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,899
just read you a short passage to sum it

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:06,519
up so yeah this one I could have many

00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,439
breakdowns these days which 10 looked as

00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,970
simple as an anxious person smiling or

00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:12,160
true leader meet up to full-fledged

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,269
crying fits or even zoning out to the

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,880
point I'm not there anymore

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,889
in some of these states I've had to call

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,360
to be picked up or be consoled on a

00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,850
phone for 45 minutes because I'm a

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,069
danger to myself having people see me

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,899
struggle made me feel in immense shame

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,699
and embarrassment in the moment and the

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:30,550
following days after so that's generally

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,199
the point of this message right and when

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,329
I shared this story was right at the

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:36,550
time we only had about 3035 women in

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,470
this group and 21 of them that saw it

00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,600
showed that compassion and made me feel

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,519
you know accepted and this was an auteur

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,649
message to share by reacting with a

00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,380
little of her in his brain I felt a bit

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,600
of compassion but I started thinking

00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,029
about it more and more right is this

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,750
really the way that we used to respond

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,769
to these sorts of messages and then it

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,800
dropped me thinking about human

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:02,290
connection to me that a murder trial now

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,620
doesn't really create a human connection

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,170
with me but a week later I drop this

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,809
message from a woman who had just caught

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,940
up with the whole channel and she sent

00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:14,100
me this

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,150
and I got one message out of the 21 and

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,430
it made me really realize how how much

00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,690
of an impact spend in five minutes

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,150
writing a message about how you actually

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,700
feel can actually mean something so much

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,020
to somebody it's pressing things so you

00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,530
don't actually have to read this it's

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:37,320
just a picture but um but yeah so how

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:39,600
can we help start with a negative maybe

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,130
don't say like this oh this is

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,990
probably the most annoying thing you'll

00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,910
ever in here if you say you're

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,800
feeling down cheerful like yeah right um

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,990
there are multiple things not to say to

00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,000
people like cheering up just don't think

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,650
about it sweep it under the rug do you

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,380
know if you're suffering from that

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,810
somebody told you do it don't do it

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:03,710
but yeah like if you're not suffering

00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,630
this like help us remove the stigma

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,820
because if we do this it'll be sort of a

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,650
little bit more confident - even me I

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,940
still struggle to do this at work to say

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,690
that I need to take a mental-health day

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,310
I will do it on the side till my manager

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,840
in private and then in the channel say

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,260
I'm taking a sick day because I still

00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,460
feel embarrassed to say mental health so

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,230
how we can help is by sharing your

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,150
feelings and your stories the more we

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,610
realize that we're all the same and we

00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,840
all feel sad and angry at different

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:35,370
points in our life it makes it easier

00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,860
also learn how to ask are you okay it

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,500
sounds so simple like these three little

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,380
words can actually sort of save

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,790
somebody's life sometimes but I'm going

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,200
to share some resources which will teach

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,090
you how to actually have this

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,660
conversation with ease and sort of

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:54,510
prepare yourself for and be comfortable

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,030
with uncomfortable sometimes I gave this

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,250
talk at what a few days ago and it was a

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,730
lot smaller of a crowd the holy

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,620
where people uncomfortable and sort of

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,450
with that the woman that sent me that

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,770
personal message that's sort of where

00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,660
I'm getting out it can be uncomfortable

00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,340
sometimes to face these sins and even

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,510
talk to somebody about it even though

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,580
you're not suffering and that's

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,700
perfectly fine like we all have to grow

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,820
and learn these sins I've literally

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,569
forgot my actual point but do

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:27,120
that whether it was on the slide

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:29,160
but yes we'll touch on a few things now

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,800
about the workplace and how we can help

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,139
with that this is something that my

00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,180
company has really been pushing on me

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,480
and teaching me and it's been really

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,610
great understanding that taking care of

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,420
ourselves and other people way more

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,579
important than a JIRA ticket like I know

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,350
we all want to release a new feature or

00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:52,050
I don't know it you're alive with

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,490
something but I can tell you that it is

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,110
much more important to take care of the

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,240
people around you because it will only

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,810
benefit you in the long run to get

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,459
better work out of people lead by

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,639
example especially if you are a manager

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:10,980
of some sort promote down time maybe

00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,439
show your employees that it is good to

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,019
leave on time right leave at 5:30

00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:18,680
don't stay back till 10:30 and think

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,120
that that's the appropriate way to work

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,009
other things is try to have open

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,819
conversations ask people how they are

00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:29,100
not just how their work is going but

00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:31,769
another one is also that I tell you a

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,209
story about I have a good friend and

00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,180
colleague that sits next to me his

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:38,220
name's Steven and we are absolutely

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,069
equals we're just developers we write

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,399
JavaScript that's it he has absolutely

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:47,309
no leadership or management management

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,949
roles but he has personally taught me so

00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:51,240
much about how to handle these sins and

00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:53,670
that's I think the best thing is that

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,800
even though I'm on this stage suffered

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,680
from it talking to you I learned by the

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,379
way people interact with me as well and

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,149
what he's shown me is that whenever I

00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,550
don't come into water he knows that I'm

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,199
feeling down or sick he reiterates to me

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,420
how important is that I take care of

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,800
myself so never feel like you can't do

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,699
anything because you're not in position

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,910
of power and also prepare yourself to

00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,920
ask are you okay like one tip is don't

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,809
ask the person if you're in a group of

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,629
people because you are definitely gonna

00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:26,699
get a Olalla yeah I'm doing sweet

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,290
maybe instead are some sort of coffee

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:31,230
order for water around the block you

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,660
might get honest answer and check in

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,399
with them afterwards they might be fine

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,150
one day but they might not be fine a

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:41,590
nest it's always good to just

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,580
chatter what's going on so yeah I didn't

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,920
it's what I'm only going to touch on

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,190
really quickly just because I have

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,500
prepared a larger sort of resource deck

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,880
fee to go through sort of gives you tips

00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,220
and tricks about little life fat so you

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,840
can try I love life hats I've tried

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,110
everything from yoga to

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,250
meditation to draw out eating salads and

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,360
 I don't know you know there's

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,760
there's a whole list of you can do

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,150
but the one thing that I can really say

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,950
that helps is communicate with people if

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,660
you've already told people how like wait

00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,820
you're suffering from and that you're

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,500
having a hard time communicate with them

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,600
in the best way that you can that will

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,730
help you and will also help them I do

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,950
this with work all the time if I say hey

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,270
I think I'm starting to slip I might

00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,310
need to work from home for a day or two

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,600
and just reset myself but I'm still

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,210
getting the work done but without the

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,670
social anxiety of having people around

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,870
but another big point is I will say this

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,090
probably another five times you know I

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,640
talk is reach out for health like there

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,840
is nothing I mean there is like you make

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,400
you feel embarrassed but there really is

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,860
nothing embarrassing about asking for

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:46,270
help like it is a really brave thing to

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:48,040
do so now I'm gonna give you a warning I

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,780
will talk about some sense in content

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,580
that does revolve around suicide and

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,020
death so if you are uncomfortable that

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,380
you are more than welcome to leave I

00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,970
will not be offended but it's only

00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,530
really wrap to this patron I told you

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:05,110
this was taking that one why I'm very

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:06,670
very down States and yeah I just don't

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,160
own a big road trip I told what you know

00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,780
I'm starting to burn out I'm gonna take

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,970
my two weeks of annual leave I'm gonna

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,400
put an impromptu trip to Western

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,990
Australia went camping by myself I like

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,630
to be away from as many people as I can

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,230
so I went to the rural desert and just

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,360
 can't

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:26,080
and it was great I had so much fun I was

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,570
happy right on the surface but this was

00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,900
towards the end of the trip and within a

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:35,410
week of taking this photo I was admitted

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,600
to hospital for a suicide attempt that

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,150
was a fun time it really was and I had

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,690
about eight police and paramedics burst

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:48,640
into my bedroom door sure it was fun but

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:50,680
yeah so in saying that when I look at my

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,980
life and I looked at society's view of

00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,670
what

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,900
success means right I on the surface

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,130
like I've traveled the world

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,390
I've lived in different countries I've

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,610
seen some really beautiful things

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,040
climbed some epic mountains and I have

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,110
fun doing it but I've had an amazing

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,170
career I've traveled the world and done

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:10,150
all these great fun things that I love I

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,120
have an amazing set of friends and

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,240
family that are super supportive and

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,160
love me to bits and pieces I now have

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,590
this adorable dog which I love

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,480
and I also have an amazing partner right

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,020
this is kind of a recipe for success

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,170
right

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,760
 let's good not really I mean this

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,820
photo still got taken and I still got

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,830
taken to the hospital so sometimes when

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,720
we view people there's other things

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,070
going on in the background so don't

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,370
always assume somebody's fine just

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,730
because giving it a thumbs up and

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:46,090
saying everything's all right but I'm

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,600
saying that mental health is not a sign

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,910
of weakness

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,290
I know sometimes in my dad states an

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:53,140
even stay on this stage I'm embarrassed

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,850
and feeling a bit of shame right but it

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,740
is not a sign of weakness I'm a strong

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,840
person I get through things and I deal

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,610
with lots of stuff Austin for health

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,700
health as well it's not a sign of

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:08,710
weakness and again if I didn't ask for

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,050
help I probably would not be here today

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,710
so I cannot stress how important it is

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,710
to ask for help

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,950
also I want you to know that your

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,320
feelings are valid no matter how big or

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,240
small a problem is whether it's because

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,140
you lost your phone or because you've

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,180
lost a loved one

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,920
okay I know they're not the same but if

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,480
you are feeling sadness because of

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,730
either you are still feeling sadness

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,690
your feelings are valid don't compare

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,860
your sadness to somebody else's um and I

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,960
really wanna talk about the side effects

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:43,510
of not talking about these sins and not

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:48,340
learning about emotional health well yes

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,650
sir my cousin Jesse when I was 21 she

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,840
took her own life

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,430
no shitty but I'm learning to laugh and

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,830
be really sarcastic right now just so

00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,020
you know um well yeah she did cheat her

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,120
in life and we were three months apart

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,120
in age we grew up together we were the

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,750
same classes were very nice

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:10,630
but yes there was no no left we we

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,000
didn't know much but the hard fact is we

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,490
did know she was actually depressed

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,710
bring on the guilt but none of us were

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,620
really educated enough to know what to

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,510
do about this and these these are the

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,700
side effects of what happens if you die

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,510
talked about it

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm real estate this various um that's

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,010
why I think it's really important to

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,140
learn about emotional health because I

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,190
really wish that this was taught at an

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,990
earlier stage in life

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,840
I really wish this was taught in primary

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:42,399
school which is when we're that young

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,919
we're taught that if we stripe our name

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,169
you should put a bandaid on it but we

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,809
are not taught what to do if we feel sad

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:52,840
or angry as soon as these Aneta they're

00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:55,059
seen as these negative emotions I don't

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,220
think they are emotions just teach us

00:20:55,059 --> 00:21:03,850
things right it teaches how we respond

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:05,049
to stuff that we think oh right but yeah

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,179
it's saying that if we don't acknowledge

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,010
being sad right we don't want to be sad

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:11,620
then how can you be fine with being

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:16,299
happy like they are literally just

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,399
emotions and this again don't take

00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:19,480
everything I say as fat I think I

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,419
actually forgot to mention this earlier

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,309
but I'm up here talking to you about my

00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:25,960
personal experiences I am NOT a doctor

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:28,149
I'm not a trained professional

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,210
do not take everything I say like as

00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:33,730
 truth it's not it's just life

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,169
experiences that I've had but yeah this

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,289
is just my personal belief is that I

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,700
don't think there is anything I don't

00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:41,740
think there is such thing as a negative

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,870
emotion I know there are some that we

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,700
don't like as much as the other ones but

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,870
our emotions are there to guide us in

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,429
making decisions when I'm happy like it

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,230
teaches me that that's something I like

00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,159
I have my partner right I want to be

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,169
with her because she makes me happy

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,909
right she just we have fun time it's

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:01,360
right right I made a decision for that

00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:04,299
but when I'm sad right I don't feel that

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,000
why it's stupid when Jessie died I was

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:08,370
sad was one of the things but I didn't

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,049
really deal with I tried to push it away

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:15,660
but sadness just was just telling me

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,770
that I loved her that's all it is and I

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,120
like to encourage you to just

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,170
acknowledge your emotions this is

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
something that I practice a lot

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,640
especially when I'm having really down

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,830
days is where I need knowledge and

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,900
emotion and start to figure out well

00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,240
okay why am i angry this person fat

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,040
swine said oh okay maybe I can actually

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,910
explain that to them or maybe this is

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,170
the real reason why I'm upset so I can

00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,740
talk more about this later I think I'm

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:43,890
out of time but yeah now I just want to

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,040
talk about a little life hack and sort

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,780
of the idea of turning these so-called

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,540
negative emotions or these feelings that

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,500
we don't really want and sort of pushing

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,140
that into something a little bit more

00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,720
fun so this is my little effect I

00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,880
started with a problem one I'm

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,910
it's really depressed and I have severe

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,040
anxiety but that leads to the fact that

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,330
I struggled to get out of it Jesus

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,370
Christ so that should be an easy

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,680
thing right and it's not I have like I

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,290
slept sometimes I can't get out of bed

00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,920
but I physically can't choose I'm just

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,400
too upset

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,990
so how they're held Trifexis well I

00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,290
thought every morning I wake up with my

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:24,720
alarm right what if I could pair that

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,360
with something that mates me immediately

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,490
feel joy something quick and easy and I

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,780
came up with bubbles because yeah

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,250
who doesn't get happy when they see

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,450
bubbles right even that little

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,920
five-year-old in the play-doh you want

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,000
to snatch that little magic wand out of

00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,450
their hand and blow your own bubbles

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,790
true so this is my doll I wanted this

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,970
thing to fire when my alarm went off so

00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:46,590
luckily I'm a developer so

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,180
I worked at the little ladder

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,340
got me a board this is probably one of

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,930
my first actual hardware projects as

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,490
well but there's some good motivation

00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,800
behind it I got one of these servers

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,960
that like twist I got a piece of

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,690
rope yeah it gets professional right

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,210
there I got some gaffer tape

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,090
this was this was the key

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,880
ingredient to making this and then I use

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:11,160
25 to write the code to interface with

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,750
the hardware and I'm also not going to

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,190
show you the code because it's really

00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,050
relevant right now and but I mean what

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,550
about that's what I had I had my little

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,960
alarm clock I mean it looks like you

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,910
know hey tennis hazard it really was

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,500
some bubbles went into my eye but I

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,860
still laughed and I had a great

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,960
time

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,920
um it looks really professional I know

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,030
you can see the gaffer tape in the

00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,230
string and like what the is going

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,419
on there but it what

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,519
that's right um and it did it helped me

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,740
get out of it some touches instead of

00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:37,019
that immediate feeling of like just

00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,809
self-doubt and just I don't have just

00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,639
pure depression I was laughing in the

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:43,230
morning and I got out of bed and I

00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:46,260
really helped I was gonna brilliant

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,980
today and slide demonstrate it but I'm

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,590
gonna be honest

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,700
it broke a few months ago and I have

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:56,789
been too lazy to touch that yet

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,139
so with that I took to social media as I

00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:59,909
do and I thought maybe I could use this

00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:02,940
again to break the state map to turn

00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:04,440
these sort of negatively viewed emotions

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,760
and feelings into something that can

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,080
bring a little joy and you can get

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,659
through it but even though we're

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,000
suffering right we can still like I find

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,080
it hard to do side projects now but when

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,970
this one came up had a little bit more

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,220
passion motivation so I thought that was

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,929
fun but yeah

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,850
forcing happiness doesn't work as well I

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,620
mean as much as I tried to do what other

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,240
people have said I talked about think

00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,830
about a later yeah it'll all get better

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,320
in time you just translate that

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,360
away like don't do it

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,880
mental health is hard it really is

00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,909
 hard but it doesn't easier and

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,809
it is easier when you do have supportive

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:42,659
people around you and I can't really do

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:44,639
this story for that saying thank you my

00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:48,090
thank you is because one thing that I

00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:49,559
did was I created a little mental health

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,179
network every please

00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,500
so these people all helped me out and

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,960
they're all different in special

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,779
different ways and I will reach out to

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,830
them even in my happiest points when I'm

00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:02,039
just I'm feeling a bit little bit

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:05,639
anxious it's okay to when I'm like in

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,110
the moment of self-harm right and they

00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:08,490
come towards me out of it but each one

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,289
of them talks to me differently as well

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,330
which I like about the variety which is

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,159
there are different moments when you are

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,529
sad that you might want to talk to

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,059
friend a because friend a really breaks

00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,799
it down towards about the problem and

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,659
that sort of thing then friend be sort

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,830
of towards you about it but then tries

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,450
to make you laugh and happy and unless

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,679
sometimes what you need and then

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,429
sometimes one friend just takes you to

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,470
the pub and that's what you're fighting

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:29,940
you know burning out of it you all that

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,500
different things but I really did want

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,389
to say a bit thanks to these five

00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,230
special people because I will not be

00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:39,090
here without them yeah and I'm summing

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,500
up these let the last two slides but I

00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,120
just want to reiterate that our

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,440
strongest tools are ourselves

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,330
which means that we don't need anything

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,070
special really like you have your voice

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,720
you have your thoughts and you can take

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,220
action on them if you see somebody

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,870
feeling down

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,880
you can approach them ask them are you

00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,159
okay if you're feeling down as well

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,450
please don't feel alone you can reach

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,309

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:05,549
after this but yeah we all have what it

00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,559
takes to change someone's life for the

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:10,700
better and it really can be as simple as

00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:12,720
three little words like I would hear

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,750
