Title: Maintainers Anonymous - Henry Zhu | JSHeroes 2019
Publication date: 2019-04-27
Playlist: JSHeroes 2019
Description: 
	Much of open source starts with scratching your own itch. It's possible that your project turns out to be useful for others. Soon you may find yourself responsible for a critical piece of the internet and are really excited.

Later you realize you have no idea who is using it, find it hard to communicate to your users, are burdened with the ever -increasing workload, and desperate to find help. You discover that it's hard to let go or trust anyone else. Should you just make more tools? How do we even begin to start solving this problem?

This talk will go into my experience of working on open source full time for the last year and the many issues faced: whether it's the burden of work, the issues of freedom, fundraising difficulties, and on top of that emotional well being. Let's talk about working to support maintainers personally, consistently, and in community.

[Music]

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,930
so thanks for having me

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:25,380
this talk is gonna be about I guess

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,300
being a maintainer maybe and it'll be

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,149
maybe it's I'm gonna bring up a lot more

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,439
questions and answers since I don't

00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:34,379
really know what I'm doing which might

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,739
seem weird yeah I want to think like how

00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,450
do we think about what a maintainer is

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:42,239
are they anonymous is it okay for a

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,710
maintainer to be anonymous does it

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,180
really matter if you even know the

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,989
people that work on the projects that

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,569
you use and yeah if you didn't know I

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,719
work on a project called Babel and yeah

00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:58,729
maybe some of you use it I want to talk

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:05,700
about a serious topic the pronunciation

00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:07,290
so Sara had this great poll I feel like

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,840
every year someone's always like oh how

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,190
do you pronounce Babel and I love that

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,740
but last year Jessica she asked the same

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,690
poll and I figured we might as well

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,850
finally like you know make a change on

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,910
the readme and so I asked someone to

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,840
make a pull request and so that was cool

00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,930
because that was actually someone's

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,090
first pull request which is pretty cool

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,720
and so what we did on the readme just

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,520
added little parentheses so it's fallow

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,820
I mean I don't really care how you say

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,500
it but that that's how we did and we and

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,630
then Sebastian who's the creator about

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,850
he he like basically recorded himself

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,860
saying it just in case you didn't know

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,720
and then speaking of audio we're

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,950
probably the only open source product

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,050
that I know of that has their own

00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,300
official song so Angus scroll he just

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,310
randomly wrote a song called the babble

00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,060
song it's kind of like a rendition of

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,560
hallelujah and yeah I thought it was

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,170
cool enough like you know we can make a

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,970
song de MD and add it to the repo so

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,849
yeah we try to have fun it's not that's

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,659
always that serious okay

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,580
so yeah it's kind of hard to imagine but

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:22,500
you know it's been one year since I

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,090
couldn't my job to work on open source

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,750
full-time somehow yeah I like this I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,660
2089 I supported myself solely on

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,640
crowdfunding through patreon and open

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,940
collective yeah so thanks to the

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,709
community I've been given time to think

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,230
about you know this problem of open

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,660
source and kind in a position now where

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm forced to think about it instead of

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,650
like Russia design but like what am I

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,980
actually what am I thinking about I

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:56,160
think if I look back to the first blog

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,260
post I wrote when I quit I was you know

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,910
I know initially before I quit I took a

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,769
year to think about if I even want to

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,330
make this decision

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,060
and at the time I was like oh I just

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,500
want to work on code a hundred percent

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,690
of the time and I was doing it half the

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,640
time and you know I think I would have

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,670
been perfectly fine doing that but then

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,230
I guess later I realized why would I

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,769
leave my job to just do that when I

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,380
could

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,290
I've already already had like a stable

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,060
job doing at half time and so I thought

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,799
you know maybe I want to think

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,580
differently about how I see open-source

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,660
I think I didn't really know what that

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,769
looked like I still don't really know

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,870
what that looks like now even though

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,220
it's been a whole year but I think what

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,660
was important for me to have you know

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,930
kind of like the mental space to think

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,640
about more the non-technical aspects of

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:48,299
open-source and so this is like a side

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,650
note but like I think myself and other

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,910
people might expect that if you're

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,209
working on open-source full-time you're

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,549
gonna like output a lot more and I think

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,410
in a way I I might expect myself to

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:00,209
output less I just don't want to it's

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,220
not that I don't really want to work

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,560
more than before and then get paid less

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,700
and then ask people that keep asking me

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,859
for help I just don't want to get burnt

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:13,560
out so yeah we we use this term open

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,910
source sustainability a lot you know we

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,220
had a panel about yesterday but like

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,660
what is it is it solely about paying

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,820
maintainer x' paying them more or at all

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:30,030
is that even a bad thing so this was fun

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:33,389
so this was at my last year's react

00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,710
reality talk after I gave my talk which

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,880
I was kind of depressed at the time I

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,580
guess

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,410
and my friend Harry and Donovan they

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,600
thought it'd be funny to they take one

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,390
of the boxes and we had like one of the

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,670
sponsors left and so they set up this

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,050
little funny tips for Babel thing it was

00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,940
like a joke and then like people

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,790
actually gave me money I think I got

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,200
like $200 from that it was it's kind of

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,640
it's funny I guess it's kind of sad too

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,100
so yeah maybe we should take a step back

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,740
and think about the phrase like what is

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,080
open-source what does it mean to sustain

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,300
it why is open-source something that

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,740
needs to be sustained and why is this

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,390
term means so many things to so many

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,950
different people yeah I think about the

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,810
word extraction we use this a lot in

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,490
computer science you know it gives us

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,250
the ability to make assumptions about

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,870
what we work on and focus on something

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,240
that matters it's a specific kind of

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,000
ignorance basically you might think of

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,770
it as being able generalize or model

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
things just like our frameworks and

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,690
tools help us to do what we need to do

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,100
and for example bowell abstracts over

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,900
browsers and JavaScript so you don't

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,400
have to think about what syntax is

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,790
writing you can write the latest syntax

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,710
or even proposed syntax but then we

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,870
think about extractions we also think

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,090
about leaky abstractions that you know

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,550
in a way in statistics we say that all

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,530
models are wrong but some are useful

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:58,320
what happens when you can't ignore the

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,070
details where those details get exposed

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,470
and the potential problems that you have

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,180
hidden but then ironically sometimes

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,680
that kind of automation in the

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,560
abstraction leads to less understanding

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,500
so this is a good example I've used this

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,620
picture before and that time I didn't

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,020
even know what this was in reference to

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,790
but you know in dawa in Bell seven we

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,070
made this decision this painful decision

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,530
of removing the stage presets and this

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,140
was like a convenience that we added so

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,390
it's my fault that we add this in and

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,110
it's abstraction not over a code but

00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,180
actually the tc39 process of the comitia

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,340
people that work on JavaScript you know

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,120
people don't really know what stage 0

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,190
means and a lot of times we I don't even

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,390
you know either it's like what what are

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,220
these numbers don't actually mean

00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,810
anything so

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,030
what is the windows of proposal get

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,380
advanced to a new stage when should I be

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,580
using it these are questions that people

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,940
don't really ask themselves they just

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,620
kind of plop it into their config

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,290
instead of stage 0 actually means strong

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,150
name or aspirational that means that

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,860
there's no requirement to be staged

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,270
there other than that someone decided it

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,750
was a good idea to present to the

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,890
committee so that's why you might be why

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,120
the committee members might be scared

00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:18,110
that people are actually doing this and

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,850
so after some time we finally decided ok

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,040
we should just get rid of this so people

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,140
have to opt in and figure out for

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,270
themselves is it am I willing to take on

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,320
this risk of adding something that I

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,720
might get removed and so you know what

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,960
about abstraction in terms of open

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,220
source what about open source as a whole

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,720
is is open source just about the code is

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,060
it just about money

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,800
clearly just adding money to open source

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,110
doesn't seem to work like after

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,910
heartbleed you know that was a big shock

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,410
to companies and they want to pour all

00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,960
this money in but we didn't solve the

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,430
problems of open source we have people

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,970
that work full-time on open source and

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,690
they still go through burnout so what is

00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:06,350
open source about you might think of

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,790
licenses but I think now like most of us

00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,280
don't really think about licenses at

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,750
least for new projects we don't think

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,260
about what we should usually just use

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:19,100
MIT it's pretty ubiquitous I like this

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,480
article that Steve Catholic wrote if you

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,390
ask you around developer what open

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,610
source means you know people might say

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,930
just something that's on github or that

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,180
there's no difference between free

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,780
software and open source aren't they the

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,040
same thing

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
I think a lot of us don't really know

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,550
the history and I didn't really know the

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,800
history of it before or - you just kind

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:40,339
of write some code you put it online and

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,219
that's open source you know maybe we're

00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,770
conflating these issues of what open

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,180
source is about and sometimes it makes

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,310
me think yeah well I agree with what

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,220
you're saying that licenses might not be

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,990
enough for us that licenses are mostly

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,820
about the consumption of open source

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,370
versus the production consumption

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,280
meaning the access of who's allowed to

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,470
use that open source

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,600
and in a way the whole point of open

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,850
source is that anyone should be able to

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,530
use it so maybe it's a mistake to try to

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,960
regulate consumption when it's actually

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,000
about the production side which is the

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,410
maintainer does that work on this and so

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,350
what how do we think about what software

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,360
freedom is kind of like what Jason said

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,070
it's not really about code anymore

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,220
I think we think about it differently it

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,340
might be freedom around process and the

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,230
community and you know I think not every

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,570
open-source project is the same not

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,170
every kind of project can raise capital

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,390
and make through a VC company or even

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,310
transition to that I wouldn't I think

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,110
it'd be kinda weird if we I made like a

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,480
battle company and like me battle as a

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,280
service although it might be funny I

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,620
don't think it's a good business model

00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,950
so you know what exactly are we trying

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,470
to sustain here in some sense I don't

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,770
really care who is using our code it

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,290
doesn't affect how much I can output it

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,350
doesn't cost me anything to support more

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,380
people using the open-source my friend

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,220
an idea wrote an article about licenses

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:15,040
and yeah I think like the more people

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,450
that download babel it doesn't affect my

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,810
production about it that scales

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,850
infinitely so in a sense even though we

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,440
talked about this idea of tragedy of the

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,180
commons in the free rider problem like

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,460
the whole point of open source in a way

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,390
is that people can free right on it it's

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,520
just that when people finally go to that

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,830
production side of asking for help

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,500
that's when it affects how much we can

00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,420
do and so we have these norms these

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,940
cultural norms are like entirely self

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,650
imposed that like in a way most

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,110
open-source if you're doing volunteer

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,790
work like you can quit at any point and

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,400
you don't have to answer it anyone you

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,100
don't have to but you feel like you have

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,250
to I wrote about this not actually not

00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,180
that long ago and there's no legal

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,470
reason to continue supporting anything

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,390
we're just in an environment where like

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,460
when we think about like inbox zero

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,200
there's an issue zero and there's a

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,190
place where like every single possible

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,570
thing that someone's going to ask you

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,400
have to find out and you have to answer

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,660
them immediately so I haven't learned

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,960
how to say no

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,940
or prioritize what to do yeah I'm like

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,110
free to do anything I want but then I

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,040
still can't leave because I've like

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,710
taught myself yeah so I think about like

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,330
what is our responsibility to our users

00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,850
or even just to people in general and I

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,920
like the way Paul States's in his letter

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,710
to the Corinthians that he's free from

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,110
all people he's free but he chooses to

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,180
make himself a servant to others using

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,410
his freedom I think he does that by

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,930
meeting people where they're at and I

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,490
think that's the way I want to live into

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,940
the open source in my life in general

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,870
and so looking back at the the name of

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,640
this talk maintainer is our maintaining

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,170
abstraction does it matter that who

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,690
works on our infrastructure doesn't

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,280
matter how we treat them yeah I guess

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,350
it's kind of obvious but like whenever

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,440
we use any technology we get used to a

00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,330
certain way of life we expect people to

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,280
act like robots that they have to

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,170
respond immediately

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,330
you know when people work in like retail

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,850
or restaurants or hotels easy to forget

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,550
they're people that have nine names they

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,140
have actual lives just like us and so

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,440
I'm just saying that maintainer ZAR

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:27,670
people too we tend to make these kind of

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,040
extremes around who maintainer czar if

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,080
you don't care that just black boxes or

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,570
robots and it's our full-time job to

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,400
just answer your questions it doesn't

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,610
help that you know you have like screen

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,500
names and you know that you know and

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,240
sometimes you know the other way around

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,700
is like I'm known as the babble guy and

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,920
so now I like I'm like shoehorn into

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,960
this ring back and we or an or that you

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,240
might think maintainers like a celebrity

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,790
you get scared to talk to them and shoot

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,710
them as these other kind of people you

00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,900
see yourself as inadequate and you can't

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,500
see them like yourself every single

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,870
thing they say becomes like this truth

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,550
and so it's kind of like it's weird

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,110
because I need people to kind of know

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,320
who I am because that's how I sustain

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:15,490
myself but I also don't really want

00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:18,100
anyone to know so yeah in a way it

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,050
creates a sense of fear and so for

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,880
longest time I was like so afraid to

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,410
like do the things I actually wanted to

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,560
do the things that I thought were

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,670
important because I had a picture of

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,020
what being a mean

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,080
Tanner watts which is like fixing bugs

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,340
and issues you know and then kinda like

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,840
what Jesus said there's a point where

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,750
you realize you don't have enough time

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,300
in the day and having more money doesn't

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,830
help either there's a point where

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,780
there's so many things you just can't

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,270
respond to it all whether it's on slack

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,090
or github or Twitter or just random

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,450
emails it's easier to feel like what

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,950
you're doing is never enough

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,630
every time you output new thing you make

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,960
a release you're always wondering like

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,790
oh what am I gonna do tomorrow but Who

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,250
am I doing this for I'm only doing this

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,020
for myself or other people that you kind

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,090
of like create this like god complex

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,470
on yourself you think of yourself is

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,600
infinite you think you're so never

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,440
getting tired or bored or anxious or

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,810
weak I really like this quote from a

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,580
book I just recently read figures about

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,920
yourself prevent you from doing your

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,390
best work or fears about your assumption

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,780
by others prevent you from doing your

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,210
own work so I think it happened both

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,560
ways I became so anxious about pleasing

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,110
other people I couldn't even do what I

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,180
wanted to do you know I looking back

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,910
this last year I did half as many

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,760
convinced in 2018 as 2017

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,060
and so I guess the question is like if

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,320
the issue is on the production side

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,970
don't I have all the leverage in the

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,300
world to say no I really like this

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,960
article called last call from Laura so

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,810
milk for choir I was in 2013 I guess the

00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,720
warning that this is kind of depressing

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,570
so it talks about the life of this

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,820
Buddhist monk in Japan and say Minamoto

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,080
and there's a really long article and

00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,570
you should read the whole thing in the

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,760
entirety but it's relevant to I think

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,620
people that just want to help others and

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,520
I think it resonates with me as a

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:22,320
maintainer and so in it he talks about

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,700
how people that are dealing with suicide

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,530
have a hard time talking to people and

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,760
so he may say made this website for

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,060
people to be able to talk with each

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,270
other

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,430
and he describes how like he would get a

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,110
lot of emails but I reply would come

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,750
within minutes and he replied to that

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,520
reply and then he would answer his phone

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,890
calls day and night and through

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,870
that like bearings already became his

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,450
anxiety he practiced something called

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,540
Zen listening where he would try to take

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,720
on how they felt so he became a fellow

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,640
sufferer with them eventually he had he

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,860
developed his own heart issues he got to

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,700
stick and respond a lot of stuff

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,250
happened and basically you know he told

00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,540
them why he couldn't respond anymore and

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,040
they actually said they didn't care that

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,890
he was sick they just had to help him

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,200
anyway and so at that point he got to

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,820
the point of you know basically to the

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,410
point of breakdown where it's like I'm

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,210
trying to help these people and I'm

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,960
dying and people still don't care about

00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:24,320
Who I am and so at the end after a long

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,640
struggle for some reason he felt like he

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,690
wanted to help them anyway even though

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:37,190
they didn't appreciate what he was doing

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:39,500
and here I think we see humility as a

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,750
sense of self-forgetfulness rather than

00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,540
stink being yourself is lower than other

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,240
people he's able to I guess detach

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,950
himself from that suffering and think

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,960
that you know the way we should be

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,630
helping people it's just like it's an

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,770
everyday thing but then he also did

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:59,810
realize that he has to change something

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,340
about how he works you can't he can't

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,520
literally talk to every single person

00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,190
that needs his help so he set some

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,020
boundaries he thought about all the

00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,209
emails and phone calls that would go on

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,440
for years with no progress and he

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,850
thought it would be weird to swallow

00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,560
himself in all these anxieties but

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,780
people he didn't even know and so his

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,280
way of studying boundaries was telling

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,830
them that he would only help people that

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,940
he met in person and even though he knew

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,820
that would be really hard for people

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,589
they would have to pay for it if he felt

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,120
like for him that if they couldn't get

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,150
there it would be unlikely he could help

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,950
them at all but I don't know how that

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,390
applies directly to what we're doing

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,290
because the whole point of open source

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,760
is that it's digital

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm not going to ask people to come to

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,780
my house for to have to get help you

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,280
know so then the question is more of an

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,250
existential question like why am I even

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,650
doing this our rationalization for doing

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,570
work only goes so far you know is it

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,000
because we love coatings because we love

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,210
of helping people to build a portfolio

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,950
to learn something new this is even

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,960
about me yeah I think a lot of the

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,340
questions of the questions and issues we

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,630
face and open source are pretty

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,649
complicated and so it's really

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,159
disheartening when people say something

00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:17,720
like just do X and even myself I feel

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,730
like open source is this monolithic

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,309
thing so I have to follow what other

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,409
people have done and I can't only find

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,850
that that's not the case and I really

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:29,809
need to learn from other different

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:32,779
fields or different kinds of people I

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,059
think about vision and not being stuck

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,980
in a certain way this quote from

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,450
boniface says the person who loves their

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,519
dream of community will destroy

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,379
community or the person who loves those

00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,389
around them will create community and

00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,789
the point there is to say that if you

00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:49,429
have this idealistic vision of what

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:50,750
should be and you have to do whatever it

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,639
takes to get there you're gonna judge

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,769
yourself and others based on what that

00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:58,309
vision is versus caring about the people

00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:02,029
themselves and I think you know this is

00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:03,559
true in other fields so in in faith I

00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:05,779
think we have to deal with the same

00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:08,659
problems and so I released this podcast

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:11,269
last year called Hopeton source with my

00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,129
friend Nadia and it was just a tiny

00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:14,960
posters on how faith released open

00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:17,769
source so whether there's this idea of

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,029
serving people commitment trust

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,700
evangelism fundraising there's a lot of

00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:26,330
parallels in what we do so I reckon then

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,440
you check that out even in urban

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,870
planning there's pretty well-known

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,179
author Jane Jacobs in the last chapter

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,889
of her book the leffen life and death of

00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,679
great American cities she asked this

00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:41,389
question what problem is a city she

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,250
talks about the kind of thinking that we

00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:46,190
need to solve the problems of a city and

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:49,309
we know that now is complexity science

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,919
or this concept of emergence and she

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,929
talks about how the city is living it's

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,399
like more of a biological thing versus

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,019
something mechanical when we think about

00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:58,909
city sometimes we just think about the

00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,220
buildings rather than all the

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:02,990
interconnectedness of a city and isn't

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:07,130
the internet and open source just a

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,530
digital city I mean you can look to gain

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:13,010
so like there's this game called Konami

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:15,080
and there's a lot of rules to it but

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,190
basically you can't see your own cards

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,350
but you can see what other people have

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,440
and you have to just help them decide

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,870
what cars to play down and so if you've

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,180
heard of deepmind which is a machine

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,270
learning thing to that Google has done

00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,470
to play the game of Go and Starcraft

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:34,760
they're actually working on this game

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,740
next which is really interesting I just

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,800
played this game recently called Baba is

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,680
you which is pretty fun name essentially

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,380
you're this little rabbit Baba and all

00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,090
the blocks are the rules of the game and

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,390
you can actually move those rules around

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,100
to change what happens and so normally

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,170
you can just walk over to the flag and

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,760
then it wins but you can move it so like

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,380
the wall isn't stopping anymore you can

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,660
walk through walls or you can make the

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,110
wall win so that when you touch the wall

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,060
you win so an example of this is lava is

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,070
push so normally if you touch the lava

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,020
you die but if you change the rules and

00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,540
now you can push the lava and you can

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,650
touch the flag and the cool thing about

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,690
this game is that there's a lot of

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,670
emergence like this idea of these

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,390
complicated things working together and

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:23,900
so in the same puzzle a different thing

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:27,230
you can do is lava is baba so what that

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,150
does it turns all the lava into baba and

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:33,140
then now you can just touch it the flag

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,580
and then you win and so you know I

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,930
talked about all these different topics

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,450
that seem like had nothing to do the

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,460
open source especially in gaming so I

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,510
figured it'd be a good intro into what's

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,060
next I'm I just I'm releasing a new

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,490
podcast today and the first episode is

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,950
about video game speedrunning which it

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,330
seems pretty different too so I'm

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,110
calling it the title of this talk

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:59,180
maintainer is anonymous and and

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,910
basically the idea here is a podcast

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,350
about sharing our lives as maintainer

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,110
'he's like how can we work together to

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,060
share a common goal whether it's in our

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,610
code or our cities in our infrastructure

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,740
I want to talk to other maintainer xand

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,020
different disciplines about how they

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,460
practice what they do what their

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,080
motivations are and what those struggles

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,080
are as I learn in public

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,100
yeah I think as programmers we have this

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,530
it's usually a good thing a tendency to

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,480
optimize everything you know that but it

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,030
tends to be that we want to solve all

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,440
our problems through technology and

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,570
technology isn't necessarily neutral

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,810
because it changes how we perceive the

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,670
world and just thinking about

00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,280
microphones and technology like we

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,720
expect things differently and so do we

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,120
ever stop to wonder is that always a

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,860
good thing and you know in the areas of

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,600
dealing with people in our relationships

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,790
do we really want our communication to

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,320
be more efficient in a sense we want it

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,520
to be inefficient because we want to

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,150
spend time with the people who are

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,130
around not to just leave and in a

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,040
similar way are things that we are all

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,170
the things that we care about measurable

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,390
or should they and so when I think about

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,580
like different fields like math and

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,300
physics versus like art and history and

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,830
literature and there's this trade-off ER

00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,830
graph between measure ability and how

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,250
complex something is and an example of

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,290
this is I've been wanting to teach some

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,360
people at church how to code and I was

00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,890
wondering if people had any advice on

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,390
this you know what does it look like to

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,790
teach someone that isn't gonna change

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,070
your career what programming is about

00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,990
and I thought that you know teaching

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,540
things layer is so abstract like

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,890
variables and functions are kind of

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,260
weird and telling people will do like

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,180
write the foo and bar it's kind of weird

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,630
too and so it'd be nice if we had a

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:51,500
concrete example so this is completely

00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,660
weird but I so we have this elevator and

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,220
short office and you have to like call

00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,620
the phone you have to bring them go

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,880
downstairs bring them back up and then

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,800
I've been doing this a lot so that's why

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,150
I've been thinking about it and then by

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,560
the time you get back up someone calls

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,550
you again and then you have to go back

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,290
down again so I think I'll back down

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,170
like a million times I was like okay

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:13,250
what if we just automated this and so I

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:15,050
did this over like a week basically text

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,580
a number had to figure out how to use

00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:19,010
Tullio and then that sends a web hook

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,100
and I had my computer have a server that

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,490
talks to this button pusher through

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,380
bluetooth and I think people thought it

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,240
was like magic and I was like this is a

00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,250
great recruiting tool to get people to

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,020
learn

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:36,270
but then I you know also it's like what

00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,860
is the point of this is something is

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,270
there something lost with this change I

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,580
think if we just went through like the

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,460
whole efficiency thing you would forget

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,860
that why this is needed in the first

00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,050
place and so I try to remind myself and

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,030
other people that in a way having

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,530
someone go down to pick someone up in a

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,720
way to greet them is a good thing it's

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,060
some kind of welcoming and at least this

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,120
is important for people that are new or

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,380
coming in for the first time and so like

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,610
it's not something you would normally

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,470
think of unless you're thinking like

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,060
aren't you know our cities and

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:10,140
opensource and churches whatever it is

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:12,930
aren't they for people in a similar vein

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,350
you know our bodies matter you know in

00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:19,320
the way technology and digitization it

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,820
creates this loss of physicality and you

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,990
know in our work sometimes it's weird

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,240
because you feel like you don't you

00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,980
don't seeing what the changes are you

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,290
know like whether it's like it's not

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,970
woodworking and so you know why do

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,610
people still buy physical books why do

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,290
people get vinyl why do people care

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,970
about being in presents with other

00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,770
people and even in this case of trauma

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,990
like this the title of this book the

00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,570
body keeps the score that our bodies

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:46,760
actually have a certain sense of what's

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:49,470
happened to them and so it's hard to

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,210
kind of get rid of this idea that

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,310
there's a one-size-fits-all like we need

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,600
to seek for this kind of answer but I

00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,840
think you know I want to live in a

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,520
posture that is curious and is okay with

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,590
not knowing anything in this world of

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,540
uncertainty and so maybe we should just

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,880
continue to pay attention to the

00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,470
problems that we're working on you know

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:13,550
I don't want to be afraid to just live

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,550
out the questions themselves thank you
