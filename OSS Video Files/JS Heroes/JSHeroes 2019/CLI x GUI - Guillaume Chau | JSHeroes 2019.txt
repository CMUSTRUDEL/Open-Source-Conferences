[Music]

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:22,490
thank you what an amazing conference a

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,800
ball so thanks for the organizer

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,930
inviting me it's the first time I'm

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,559
coming to Romania it's a very nice

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,890
country as well so today I'm gonna talk

00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,920
about UCLA so my name is Guillaume

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,940
I'm from vue.js co-team and I welcome

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,570
various projects like the view dev tools

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,120
and use alive you can find me on Twitter

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,300
on Twitter on everywhere else at Actium

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,859
so let's get started so if you Silla is

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,909
mostly all about creating view projects

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:05,129
so let's go back in history and take a

00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:11,280
look at what was happening previously in

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:14,250
Vietnam yeah like cats so the previous

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,330
way of using visual I was this view init

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:22,230
command so for views like version 1 and

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:27,210
2 it was great but as a few problems

00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,370
like yeah it can like use a lot of

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,250
different templates for your projects

00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,290
but the problem is all of those

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,590
someplace are incompatible with each

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,080
other so for example you can have like a

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,520
default template in JavaScript and then

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,920
you have another template with

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,030
typescript and then another template

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,170
with PWS support but you come like mix

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,690
them together also it was mostly for

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,780
scaffolding so basically generating a

00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,840
bunch of files that makes your project

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,200
and then basically it's snowing in the

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,950
no longer there to help you

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,319
it also automatically like the only the

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,739
only if you had it was to eject you

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,610
because basically you create a new

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,000
project generate spike and well as I

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,450
said no longer there also upgrading was

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,849
difficult so for example if we made some

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:30,909
changes to our web pack templates

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,849
well basically you had to read the

00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:36,579
commits and try to manually make those

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:41,409
changes back to your project so very

00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:44,319
difficult as also the forked template so

00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,360
we had a hard time of graying as well so

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,079
for example the amazing tax rate came

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,810
from Microsoft had our offshore

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,030
template to make the type 3 1 and when

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,230
we made it some changes there there like

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:04,290
always had a lot of trouble updating so

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:09,400
basically guys some like a lot of issues

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:13,420
so we thought well maybe we can like fix

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,359
all of those so that's why we like

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:21,299
started working on the new version of

00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:24,310
usally which i think is like amazing

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:28,150
so visa live free was released last year

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,819
in in the summer and it was like a lot

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,819
of effort to get there but I think it

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:38,139
worth it it was a so you can install it

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:42,370
now so if you previously used it you

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:45,220
saliva version 201 you should remove it

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,780
from your computer because we renamed

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:53,940
the the package to use the NPM

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:57,430
organization scope so at view / CLI and

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,349
to use it you can use the view create

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,930
command with the name of your app and

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,609
then it will like ask you a bunch of

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,160
questions and then create your project

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:09,220
and then you can go to the project ran

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,500
several commands like serve to to other

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,319
web pack development server running or

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,470
built to like build your files for

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:22,300
production so it's very quite easy to

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:25,090
use and this is one of the most

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,760
interesting but of this it's compared to

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,490
view in it it's going to be a very very

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:36,270
differently and it also has a lot of new

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:39,939
things like web pack for bubble PWS both

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,719
purposes touch great

00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:48,639
a lot of beauty videos really so that's

00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:52,379
great and um how did we manage to do

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,699
that compared to the old view today so

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,709
previously we added template system

00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,240
which were incompatible with each other

00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:03,520
as I said and so we ditched it and

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,729
replaced it with a plug-in system which

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:12,339
is totally different but it's great

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:14,199
because it allows us to like well ask

00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:16,419
you what feature you want when you

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,580
create a project so for example we can

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:22,360
you can select if you want touch it and

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:26,619
if you want a testing solution or if you

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,319
want bubble you can even like add new

00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:31,330
feature after creating the project so if

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,919
you forgot to add unit testing or

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,899
end-to-end testing solutions to your

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,149
project you can like add them later

00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:40,569
you're like not forced to recreate

00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:44,589
project from scratch also we made a

00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:50,469
great it makes upgrade easier because we

00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:52,719
can just like put make some changes

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:55,779
inside the begging's and picking us up

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:59,949
basically NPM packages so you just have

00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:05,550
to upgrade them and you good to go so

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:08,740
that's pretty amazing right yeah perfect

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:13,179
but that's not the only thing we have

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,009
for install for your saliva tree so it's

00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:17,139
no longer ejecting you from the start

00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:20,079
and it's red it's gonna live in your

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:26,979
project and help you build your app in

00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:29,019
its entire life life cycle so this is

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:32,769
what we call the the runtime and it is

00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:36,369
it's you sell a service like command you

00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:38,679
can run new scripts on with npx and it

00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:42,039
takes a common name and you can do a lot

00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:45,459
of things basically what it does is it's

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:48,059
going to look for this package which is

00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:52,959
installed in any views of everybody acts

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:53,860
and this package contains basically all

00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,500
the basic star

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,530
to a few up running or paid for

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,900
operation so basically we're back on

00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:04,540
some of the south and it's gonna also

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,490
look for the other plugins which are

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,310
installed in your project like for

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:13,270
example touchscreen or PWA or yesenin

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:17,400
and then gonna configure it everything

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:22,420
so and like does it do some work for you

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,460
so you can both modify webpack

00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,430
configuration for example so if you have

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,950
a scene picking in your project and you

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,530
can like a daddy s name rotor for you

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,440
and then you get the errors from the

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,170
essence in your like application after

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,750
webpack compiles it you can also

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,640
register new commands so the async

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,130
bugging again can register a length

00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,350
command for you so you can run just a

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:53,650
light service length and then will like

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:56,230
fix your your files so basically now

00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:00,070
this is no longer just about creating a

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:03,250
project but you can also you can also

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:07,720
use it for developing the app testing

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:11,260
the app producing the build for your

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,290
production servers and deploy your apps

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:18,520
or your files on s3 for example and

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:22,000
minimal so now this light is like the

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:26,230
complete build tool for the whole like

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,580
application lifecycle and if by any

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:33,130
chance that's not enough for you so if

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,810
you like all the built-in features

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,110
you're missing something

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:41,140
Oh thankfully we have a public API that

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,710
allows the view community to create

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,470
pickings as well and I'm very happy

00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,230
because the this number of plugging is

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,230
always increasing so it's amazing we are

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,560
almost 500 pickings you can choose from

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,110
and you can create your own because well

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,550
it's a public API and then you can share

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:08,350
it with the world and that's not

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:11,680
I have to say about this life and this

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:18,820
is what I worked Masson it's the view

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:21,580
sly user-interface what you can call it

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,530
with this c'mon so if you like install

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,320
this Ally you can run GUI in your

00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:29,170
terminal and this is quite strange

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:34,600
because it's supposed to be a

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:37,840
command-line interface but just so

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,820
before like going into why just to let

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,250
you know a little bit but what going to

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,280
happen if you run this this command so

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:48,640
first I'm gonna spin up a little node

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,630
server with a power server and then open

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,850
a page in your browser with which is

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,150
basically if you app and then both will

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,360
communicate with each other so that

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,810
means you you don't have to to download

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,300
gigabytes of excellent library is

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,700
dependencies so it's basically just a

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:15,280
little web app on your on your computer

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:17,860
lovely but yeah as I said usually is

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,430
like it's a lie so still I stands for

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,490
come online interface come online so in

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,370
the terminal so why do we got a user

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,550
interface in there

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,470
and the reason the reasons are since

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:36,220
like justify free is more complex

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,280
because it has like more choices you can

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,140
make it has like way more comments than

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,700
previously because no longer just create

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:49,420
project and also like all those building

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:55,420
videos creates a lot of options to show

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:58,090
farm as like the view framework we like

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,810
we say we are progressive framework

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,840
because we try to always improve the

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:08,110
variants millions and make the oath the

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:13,600
whole framework and ecosystem easier to

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:16,540
use and get started with so so I like

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,470
this this rice is the code so

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:24,100
let's interface size everything I like

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:27,850
this and this atom was from FS from God

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,459
sandbox and basically the goalie hairs

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:35,050
like to turn all of those like CLI

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:40,329
interfaces into graphical user

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:42,850
interfaces so the benefits are you get

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:45,699
more contacts so for example here you

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:48,060
can quickly see that when creating a

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,820
project you have a few steps like

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,410
details presets features and

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,660
configuration and also we can like put

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,760
some more information about what's going

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,000
on in which folder you're gonna create

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,519
your project like what are all the

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,190
options available

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,380
we can also like provide more detailed

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,220
explanations because we are not limited

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,560
to small text on the interface in the

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,709
terminal so for example here I can

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,940
describe what a Prezi is without you

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:24,699
having to go to the documentation and we

00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,800
can also improve this capability so for

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,649
example if you want to add a new plugin

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,810
to your project this is an entire

00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:36,459
session interface for that so you don't

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:40,360
have to go to npm and try to find which

00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:42,790
picking are available we can also

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,880
improve the like the interaction

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,819
experience with yes so this I think this

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,100
is the best example so basically instead

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:55,420
of asking you which color you want you

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,029
can directly display we all color picker

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,399
so I think that that's great and I think

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:04,480
will be quite hard to do in the terminal

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,269
and also we can viously

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,300
localize everything so that's quite

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:15,100
important for example in Japan so that's

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:17,589
the Japanese version I'm much more like

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,300
it can do much more things than that so

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:26,350
let's give it a look shall we

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,660
so it's everywhere so I have it already

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,070
running so the first thing you want to

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:34,120
do to try it it's

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:37,420
and the view UI command and then you see

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,570
this webpage opening up in your browser

00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,699
and it's basically you survived but

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,880
turned into a graphical user interface

00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,980
so the first thing you notice is this

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,160
view project measures so it allows you

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,310
to list your your all your projects and

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,100
then switch between them easily so that

00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,550
for now we don't have any I can import a

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:05,920
project so for example visa like UI

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:07,870
itself and then you get like a full user

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,440
interface I think I'm gonna get back to

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,300
this in a moment so as you can see we

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,860
have our project listed here

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:22,149
you can also create new projects so here

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:26,440
you got a little like folder in the face

00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:29,589
so you can like browse your your

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:35,339
filesystem I'm gonna like select this

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:40,180
folder and then you get into the project

00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:46,510
create wizard we can zoom a little bit

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:48,850
more yeah so you can start by choosing

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,800
them and the nice thing is since we are

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,560
like in user interface we can like add

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,139
little like things like saying oh this

00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,370
folder already exists now maybe you want

00:14:56,139 --> 00:15:14,439
to change the name or overwrite so let's

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:16,149
say I want I will like name okay then we

00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:18,519
can see there are a bunch of options you

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:23,139
can accelerate different kind of package

00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:25,120
managers and well you can by default

00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:28,600
yesterday we created we get repository

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,279
but you can disable that and then when

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,709
you're finished like with the basic

00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,500
details of your project you go to this

00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:38,649
second step which is choosing a preset

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,290
and the preset is basically a section of

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,290
videos you want for your project to have

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,779
so big by

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:49,680
what you have this preset will only

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,470
bubble in the essence you can also save

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,500
preset so those two are like my own

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,670
presets and the most interesting thing

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:03,240
is you can select manually and then go

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,639
like manually select the features you

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,360
want for your new project so for example

00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:12,389
we could say want some CSS purposes

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,139
thing for example and some unit testing

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:18,690
why not I'm gonna use configuration

00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,660
files as well and then on the next

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:25,079
screen you can configure the features

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,660
you just selected so if they have any so

00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:30,660
since I selected CSS preprocessors I can

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,620
like choose which language I want to use

00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,389
in my project so for example stylus and

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,399
if you selected yesenin for example you

00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:42,180
can select which yes name configuration

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,819
you want for example standard and you

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,750
can also select unit testing solution so

00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:50,730
button we have mucho chest you know go

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,649
with chest and when you turn you can

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,290
click on create project and then save

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:58,260
the selection you just made into a new

00:16:55,290 --> 00:17:00,029
preset so that next time you can use it

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,329
directly instead of going through this

00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,640
all all process again I'm going to skip

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:10,140
this and then it's going to create a

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,179
project so I mean dev FML so that's why

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,559
it's very fast but normally will like

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:18,600
install things from NPM but I'd like I'm

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,600
not sure it's good idea to do this in a

00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:27,150
live demo okay so II go in in your like

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,790
the first you you you see in a project

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,429
is the project dashboard and this is

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,860
basically a grid of widgets so if you're

00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:37,799
familiar with Android for example you

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,780
have this like this top like a feature

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:42,059
on Android when you can like put widgets

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,200
and that's basically what's going on

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:49,340
here so I can like click on this and go

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:53,850
to customize mode and then I can move

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:56,330
widgets around I can add new sorry add

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,330
new widgets

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:10,950
some of them can be resized you can move

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:15,000
them around like this and wear you down

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,670
you can have this customized like

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,160
dashboard experience in your project and

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:23,730
by default this widget will like show

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,940
you the the view gist news you can

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,310
configure some widgets so for example if

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:34,170
you have an analysis think you can use

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:36,000
it there this one is gonna like run some

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:40,080
tasks so and you can just select the

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,190
tasks we go to task a task a little bit

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,770
later the second page is the picking so

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,620
here you can see all the views lively

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:53,270
pickings in installed in your project so

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:56,310
as I selected unit testing with chest

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,340
when I created the project you can see

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,470
it's installed here and the nice thing

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,260
is you can add new plugins

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:07,110
so if you go there you get a nice search

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,920
experience with all the views life

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:13,770
really begins available on NPM so for

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:19,530
example you can like search for graph G

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:25,290
wall and have a few options I'm gonna

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:28,890
choose for example PWA support and then

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,750
you install the plug-in and then it can

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:34,470
have some configuration with this one

00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:38,000
doesn't and finish and then Agana

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:41,730
it's gonna like install the bringing in

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,180
into the project so this view like isn't

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:49,740
working because I mean a demo but I can

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:52,170
show you what what it looks like this is

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:58,710
another instance I'm using to develop

00:19:52,170 --> 00:20:02,610
you said I you I show you this I'm gonna

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:06,360
need the network but it's so good it

00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:08,299
like works so for example if I attach it

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:17,130
to this demo

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:20,360
by the Wi-Fi God so this one is actually

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,360
asking a few questions

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,580
but basically what but it's gonna happen

00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,890
when you are bringing is that it can

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,010
have what we call generator so you can

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,950
add new files and modify existing files

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,770
so here we have this get get up like

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:45,330
view of what just happened in your

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:49,080
project so for example the plugging

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:53,790
added those new files here so a bunch of

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,640
type files and also happens to update

00:20:53,790 --> 00:21:00,660
existing files like the package.json

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,020
file so we you can directly see that it

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,770
added a few things like a new scrape and

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,590
new dependencies and then you can commit

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:14,580
all of this with a get up commit give it

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:18,179
a message and then save so going back to

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:22,470
the demo you can continue and now we

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:26,580
have this new PW a pinging I was heading

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,520
yeah so that's like crazy to add

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,890
pickings you can also update them from

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,760
the user interface so if you have

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,710
updates will show up the next page is

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,960
dependencies so that's everything which

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,510
is not a fusillade picking installed in

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,840
your project so you can see that we are

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:49,320
using a few of them like view for

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,410
example you can update them and install

00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,870
them or install new dependencies you can

00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,059
say that between a main dependency or

00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,790
government dependency and then for

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:03,299
example if you need a lot of mesh you

00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:07,860
can search for it select it and then

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:09,450
install it the next one is configuration

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,250
so this is very interesting because

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,270
since we are in the graphical user

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:18,570
interface we can turn some configuration

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,840
files into configuration screens so I

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,940
think we it's a great you

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,270
better using the experience than having

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,940
you just like a cryptic configuration

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,980
file you don't really know about even

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,380
sometimes the Confucius and the

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,270
configuration file is like empty and you

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,930
need to find out on the internet what

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,180
you can you can put in in it so hey we

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,570
got a few different configuration

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,130
screens

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,560
so the first one is about this light

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,680
itself and you can configure a bunch of

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,860
things and as you can see we can like

00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,770
explain what which option that's right

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,140
and you can even like click on more info

00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,740
and you go directly to the documentation

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:04,360
and this one is very interesting as well

00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:07,280
because we are actually dynamically

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,910
getting all the available rules in the

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:15,320
view es9 packing and we can show them to

00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:18,530
you here so you can directly see which

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:22,670
will you can you can enable or disable

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:25,940
in your project and what they do and

00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:31,010
since I just added the PWA plug-in as

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:32,870
well well I got a PWA screen when I can

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,300
like change the name of the app all the

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,990
different colors associated with the

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:47,600
splash screen for example and so let's

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:50,060
open a new project here so it looks like

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,160
very like standard Java Script project

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,670
with a package.json file and a few

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:58,070
different exhaust files but there is no

00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,800
web pack configuration to be found here

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,380
so that's because this referee is doing

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,800
all the hard work for you so let's say I

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:12,620
want to change the name of the

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:17,000
application here and then change also

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:20,990
the main theme to be like cheese arrows

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,750
blue maybe something like that and then

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:28,220
I'm gonna click Save and the last thing

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:31,400
is just right you are just like applied

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,890
but I the changes I just made to the

00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,610
whole project so it just created nice

00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,460
new

00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,380
configuration file for you so it wasn't

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,809
there before you didn't have to know

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:46,250
about it but now it's there and you can

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:49,429
see the what I just entered is also like

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:52,010
inputted there and the nice thing is you

00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:56,240
also it also just updated the web

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,529
manifest of the app so it added the like

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,399
the the right color

00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:04,059
I just changed and the nice thing is you

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:07,100
don't need to know about like updating

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:10,669
manifest on the view configuration file

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,970
so that's nice for example if I go back

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:17,090
to view so I can like enable for example

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,090
the runtime comparative view and save

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,519
and you have an Andy little button here

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,940
to open directly the configurations

00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,710
files

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,200
impacted by this configuration screen

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,200
and we can see it just added this year

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,370
and the last screen is task which is

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,250
basically all the scripts you have in

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,340
your project so the first one is like

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:46,549
the most just for one in in the webmin

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:50,149
because it's gonna launch we're packing

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:53,899
the with no modes so let's run it and as

00:25:50,149 --> 00:26:00,010
you can see we can enhance the the like

00:25:53,899 --> 00:26:03,409
the task with oh it's not working sorry

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:12,080
with like a specific user interface here

00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:15,010
Oh demo you know demoed that on the

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,010
stabilization

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,050
so he what's gonna happen is that when

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,640
webpack finishes building your project

00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:32,290
it can directly show you a bunch of

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:35,260
stats like speed estimations and what

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,230
well like what is the biggest dependency

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:43,570
in your project and it can also display

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,730
an analyzer graph so you can browse what

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:50,230
what's inside your project on like which

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:53,560
is taking some space in your bundles and

00:26:50,230 --> 00:27:01,180
you can directly open the app and it is

00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:04,150
all like you and actually lab isn't

00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,270
gonna work you can also build a project

00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,820
no German will not work

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,000
sorry about that so you can also build

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,520
for production here and the nice thing

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,190
is you can also go to like the

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,760
parameters of the task and enable for

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,370
example modern mode which is gonna build

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,770
two versions of your app and one is

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,780
going to be optimized for modern

00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,020
browsers so that's why we have two

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:35,200
different progress bars here so the

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,570
green one is the legacy bundle which is

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,940
going to support all browsers like IE

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,680
and the blue one is the modern mode

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:48,460
bundle so you can switch between them

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,290
and you see for example that the the

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:54,550
college is polyfills are not there

00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:56,980
anymore so that's nice you can also run

00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:00,160
other tasks and if there is no specific

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:07,390
UI for it you just see the terminal

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:12,460
output directly here I think that's

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:14,410
pretty much it for for the demo well you

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,040
can play with it around you there are a

00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,480
lot of other things you can do but

00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:25,540
meaning out of them so that for the demo

00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:27,600
so that's that's pretty much it so what

00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,640
was going on a little bit of

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,610
explanations of when I created

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,880
basically view like installed the

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,980
plugins corresponding to the fridges as

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,110
selected during created in project and

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:47,460
then like Iran we call generators to

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:53,700
create new files or edit existing files

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:56,080
as we saw in get like this view and then

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,880
generators can like for example add new

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,420
dependencies to your project so we can

00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:04,420
install them for you and then we can do

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:09,040
some like fun processing like lynching

00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,610
the files or why not that's not all you

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,600
can do

00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:15,940
so it also have a public API so you can

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,900
extend the user interface in your

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,970
obviously packing so that's like your

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:26,950
little explanation graph but basically

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:30,700
it says you can do stuff so for example

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:33,450
you can add like prompts in your plugins

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,610
but you can extend add more informations

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:39,940
for the UI so for example you can add a

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:42,970
link to a documentation page or you can

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,000
group the prompts to get there in the

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:48,570
user interface which is going to look

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,820
like this so this is from the the

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:55,420
paragraph table dragging so it's like

00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,840
enhanced for the the user interface you

00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:01,000
can also like we saw add new

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,770
configuration screens which is going to

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,250
look like this for example

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:09,910
so the the screen is configuring Apollo

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:13,180
server you can also load custom

00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:16,210
components so this is what we call clay

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,630
and atom here and you can load load new

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,250
components so Jupiter routes and then

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:25,120
you can communicate with your plugin

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,640
which is a node.js server we started

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,870
with the view UI common and then you can

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,570
do nice things like adding custom

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:37,180
components and so a bunch of example

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:39,490
code you can see that you you will be

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,060
able to pose this slide those rights

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,660
later and for example with those you can

00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,660
okk month like enhance the tasks so like

00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,600
we so we have a web pack dashboard but

00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,450
for example a plug-in can add new

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,780
components like this graph QL playground

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,660
directly in your user interface so

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,440
that's again from the Apollo cough q

00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:09,660
opening you can also add new widgets to

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:14,080
the dashboard so for example you can add

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:17,830
let's say monitoring widget sorry widget

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:22,060
to the dashboard from upload engine for

00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:24,880
example but yeah that's pretty much what

00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,920
I wanted to say a little bit of

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,200
information about what's going next

00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,590
what's going to come to views live free

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,470
and DUI in in the future so we are going

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:38,890
to be walking on PNP M support so can we

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,100
wish about NPM on yawn and we can very

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,900
since both the NPM as well

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:47,050
we also gonna improve the great

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,970
experience for these applicants improve

00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,670
the euro village currently it's like the

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,570
standard web pack you overlay but we

00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:57,730
have plans like being able to click on

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:01,510
the errors and open the the right file

00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:05,700
directly unfit for the UI walking on a

00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:09,190
settings page more keyboard interactions

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,080
and also the ability to install Google

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:14,710
plugin so for example you can imagine

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,870
someone creating a gate plugging which

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,290
integrates with the UI and like

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:25,630
displaying the the gate graph on commit

00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:28,300
user interface so that's coming soon so

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:32,200
you can find out more by going to our

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:35,320
road maps for views live at this URL and

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,840
that's it you can like check out more

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,590
about viscera this is the official

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:45,400
documentation and I have a patreon page

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,710
so if you like the openSUSE work I do

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,810
for the do community on graph geo

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,450
community you can check it out I have

00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:56,920
four amazing sponsors so if you scroll

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:59,770
on vo mastery great learning resources

00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,560
for view and also beautify which is much

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:06,040
design component library and from the

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,280
love which is the organizers of view

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,360
Amsterdam so picture love to them for
