partner so I'm here today to read you a

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,370
story

oh this is

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,670
hark you've heard the commotion there's

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,410
word you're getting a promotion your

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,300
boss calls you in and starts to suggest

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,120
that the management career path might

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,489
just be the best you tell her yes and

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,320
quickly start nodding inside your bodies

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,060
applauding but as you get up to leave

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,880
your legs start to shake what if you've

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,950
made a terrible mistake the rest assured

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,450
good friend and I told mean to offend if

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,780
this is a misstep it's the first of

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,490
plenty so gather around friend rhyming

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,360
sound I plan to list off a few of the

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:29,789
many hoo the management mistakes that

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:33,750
you'll make so hi I'm Jeff limbic that

00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:36,780
guy I'm from Seattle and I'm an

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,330
engineering manager at NPM yeah we have

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,100
managers I'm one of four in the

00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,990
engineering department yes we have

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,300
departments we're like a whole company

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,890
of people that sells goods and services

00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,289
that you could totally buy and that's

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,270
how we pay for things like the registry

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,990
and the CLI and now that I'm a

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,619
management

00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:01,380
I'm totally obligated to plug that yeah

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:06,989
so it's been roughly a year actually I

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:09,800
was promoted I was put into management a

00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:12,900
year ago from senior software engineer

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,450
and sometimes it has been really really

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,940
awesome and sometimes is the key there

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,430
because it is not always awesome it's

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,129
like a super firehose of a job and so

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,569
today I'm here to prep you for some of

00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:26,760
the stuff you are bound to do if you

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,250
also make this transition and I say prep

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,640
you because I was warned about all of

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,849
this stuff and I did it anyway so here

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,849
we go

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,200
after the news of your change sinks in

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,520
you'll update your title on LinkedIn

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,080
manager of engineers you think with some

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,050
Cheers and that's when something else

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,880
creeps in notifications might give you

00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,890
the notion that this is some sort of

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,090
promotion but I'm here to tell you good

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,040
friend you're no closer to the end than

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,530
if you'd started swimming the ocean and

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,810
truly the fact of the matter is even if

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,030
you're a very good string adder managing

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:10,100
humans and writing code are a completely

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:13,310
different career ladder mistake number

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,740
one it's a promotion so let's talk about

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,540
career progression and ladders a very

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,760
common misconception is that becoming a

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,430
manager is the next step for a senior

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,410
engineer this is where you go to make

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,320
more money and have more power and buy

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,740
hot tub boats and retire and this could

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,060
not be further from the truth

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,650
real talk you know how you'd spent

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,450
several years getting from like

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,490
associate or junior engineer into the

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,770
senior position engineer position you

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,690
get to do that all over again like from

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:45,020
the very beginning you know how people

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,459
get hold degrees in business that should

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,660
be an indicator that this isn't just

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,470
something you're going to be an expert

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,239
at and this is actually a super real

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,190
problem that's inherent in our industry

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,930
we frequently expect an act like

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,310
management is just some extension of

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,590
engineering that you can pick up as you

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,630
go but it's a completely different craft

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,820
it's something you'll need training and

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,220
a lot of reading and holy cow a ton a

00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,739
practice to even crack the level of

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,400
getting good and but don't take my word

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:16,250
for it Marco Rodgers has an excellent

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,330
tweet storm about this and basically so

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,100
as everybody else who's been in

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:24,620
management for a while so if it's not a

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,150
promotion if your company only moves

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,370
into management after the senior

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,470
engineer and management isn't a path

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,600
that you're interested in maybe talk

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,120
about implementing a career ladder for

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,040
engineering alone like do you have

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,330
levels above just senior engineer do

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,580
have senior two and three do you have

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,470
staff or principal engineers these are

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,419
actually super important roles to an

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,270
organization like that you can structure

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,610
or to create structure and growth and

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,720
they're completely different positions

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,720
in every way than man

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,030
now the journey continues let them see

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,100
what you've got in you to start to

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,650
adjust the plan is a must read this

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,360
entire new thing will pin you you

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,190
schedule your meetings you do all your

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,160
greetings your drive to succeed is

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,690
sincere what to do now you wonder oh wow

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,460
what could be better than what got me

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,479
here

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,250
suddenly it's three months later and

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,800
your projects are past their dates and

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,630
your team is acting quite sorely because

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,880
instead of focusing on being a manager

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,880
you decided to do two jobs poorly

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,020
mistake number two doing what got you

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:35,000
here so now that you've hit management

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,250
the whole what do I do a phase kicks in

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,740
and your instinct is extremely clear at

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,599
this point why not continue what got me

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,020
here people are happy with that work

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,660
obviously you're in leadership now right

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,090
well if your bosses are good at their

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,590
jobs they likely didn't switch your

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,970
whole career path on you because you are

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,830
the best coder around this guy so they

00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,690
are hopefully moved you into management

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,010
because they saw something in the way

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,110
you motivate people

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,470
this means that focusing in the work you

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,510
were doing before will actively sabotage

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,110
your ability to succeed in your new

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,110
position

00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,180
and watching for this is difficult at

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,680
best it's easy to fall back into

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,650
patterns of comfort and what you're good

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,789
at sometimes you're the only or you're

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,099
the person who knows best how to

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:24,710
accomplish a certain task and it only

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,750
take you a day but the problem is is

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,490
that's not your job anymore you've been

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,220
moved into a position where your job is

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,940
to manage a team and you can only do one

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,310
of these things well at a time so what's

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,620
the alternative

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,659
make everybody on your team level up do

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,880
you know a task better than anybody else

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,190
document it walk somebody through the

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,909
code teach them how to do those tasks

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,860
pair heavily for knowledge transfer and

00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,039
make the other person drive while you do

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,490
it

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,050
now you can take a step back and look at

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,050
the future of what your people need

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:09,229
well now that you're not coding day to

00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:11,419
day you can start to think away you'll

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,489
schedule I bet some new meetings to set

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,119
yourself as the team's brand new

00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:17,019
architect

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:21,580
and while this naturally elates you

00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:21,580
unfortunately your team now hates you

00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,860
mistake number three time to be the

00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:30,259
architect day-to-day coding didn't work

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,999
and so you slipped into what's next

00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:35,059
instinctually for you long-term

00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:37,189
technical solutions this feels good it

00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:38,629
feels natural you've likely been at it

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,330
for a while if you're a senior engineers

00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:43,039
so making this transition you know the

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,610
arena well and these decisions are

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,069
pretty easy to make except now you've

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,929
robbed your team of agency you see

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,909
planning ahead for your team doesn't

00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,889
mean choosing their tech solutions it

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:58,759
means helping them see what products

00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,979
they're building and as a manager you're

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,929
able to give important information and

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,959
context to your people that will help

00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:07,429
them inform their own decisions you can

00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,709
help them take that information to the

00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:11,990
next level by helping them write rfcs

00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,490
you can help them you can help them

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,050
provide value and show their worth to

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,139
the company by letting them drive some

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,849
of the product decisions even now this

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,800
doesn't mean that you sit back and forgo

00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,360
your knowledge about the subject you

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,509
should be spending time reading and

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,559
keeping up and keeping yourself sharp

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,360
because there will be times when you

00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:31,309
hire new people and being able to

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,300
onboard is a really nice way to get in

00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,819
some of that pairing time that you

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,380
probably miss and keeping sharp also

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:38,870
allows you to be a sounding board for

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,849
your team so you're not the architect

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,849
you'll be the architects right-hand

00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,150
you're helping your team you're living

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,520
the dream it's time to help with

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,690
coaching you do code reviews but don't

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,420
set too many rules you don't want to be

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,520
encroaching you deliver advice and try

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,910
to be nice you don't want to be the bad

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,800
seed but soon you will mind because if

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,970
the process is not defined it's

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:11,660
definitely not guaranteed mistake number

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,460
four assuming expectations okay so when

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,170
you're an engineer and the next project

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,120
comes through from product you normally

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,650
have some level of expectation you

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,990
expect the spec to have some level of

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,510
detail to it you expect the requirements

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,310
if it's UI or UX work you likely expect

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,140
some designs this is pretty standard

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,440
stuff

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:33,650
hold what you're thinking they're the

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,450
same stuff goes literally for everything

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,760
else in human interaction and now that

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,290
you're a manager it's 100% on you to

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,410
make sure that all things are defined in

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,840
one heck of a crystal clear way if

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:46,820
something is going to be not okay then

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,660
the parameters that somebody can deliver

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,740
within need to be drawn very clearly

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,690
how's the team show the work that's

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,600
doing is it a Kanban board oh is it the

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,250
expected velocity written down then how

00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,900
about the card sizing how about

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,540
estimations is there a way you expect

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,460
these things to be done if you haven't

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,589
written it down and talked about it with

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,330
your people and taken their feedback and

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,460
iterate it on it and come up with a

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,960
process that is clearly defined then you

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,910
haven't come up with anything at all and

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,650
nothing is guaranteed and you should

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,490
fully expect to be frustrated later and

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:21,589
it's all your fault that's just the way

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,210
it is welcome to management you're

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,100
setting the rules and these are software

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,290
engineers do you know good software

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,839
engineers are at getting directly to

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,760
where the lines for rules are that's

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,050
actually kind of their specialty that's

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,870
why you hire them so the thing I said to

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,430
hold earlier um where you expect stuff

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,920
from product and they don't actually

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:46,010
give you the things you ever need that's

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,110
a tough one but in being a manager

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,830
sometimes the people giving you the

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,390
things they want they're gonna be really

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,270
really nebulous and you need to help

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,590
your team and it's not ideal but you can

00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,880
work with it before you start to code

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,460
turn around and write out a statement of

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,810
work that makes them happy declared the

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,490
business value in what you're about to

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,530
do just in the first paragraph like

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,660
write it out and then go spec out the

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,580
pieces that you're going to build then

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,690
pass it off to product like give it back

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,150
to and be like this is probably what you

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,610
meant to give us and they'll go hmm yeah

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,680
sure check and then you can give it to

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,290
QA for some requirements checking as

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,060
well and that actually provides an

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,650
opportunity for your team to really own

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:31,400
something and in the end everybody will

00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,870
love your team because of this

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,970
especially your bosses because when they

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:40,790
say where is this thing you can say well

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,790
I delivered it and there's no excuses

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,260
you get messaged a lot her in meetings

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,930
all day and the video calls are just

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,070
ruthless you're answering questions left

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,770
and right and off your head you're

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,480
saying just do this but you're finding

00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,780
the solutions that are being proposed or

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,160
coming off and effective and toothless

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,630
because you haven't given thought to the

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,470
statements you make and not thinking

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:10,010
through things is just hubris mistake

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:13,920
number five making quick decisions

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,690
so this rumor that people like somebody

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,730
who thinks quickly or a person who like

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,440
responds right away to solve a problem a

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,810
person who tells it exactly how it is

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,140
and that's when you're their

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,830
leader

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,140
you see hard problems they take time to

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,030
think about they take a lot of thinking

00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,190
time if you end up just flying off the

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,810
handle with answers you end up being a

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,940
reactive manager instead of a proactive

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,660
manager and I promise that's not where

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,430
you want to be so like how much time per

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,720
day do you think like sit around and

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,580
think about problems that you're dealing

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,530
with like really the problem itself in

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,150
rich hickies talk hammock driven

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,410
development which if you haven't seen

00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,730
hammock driven development it's an

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,620
awesome talking it's totally on YouTube

00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,540
and you should go check it out he

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,460
focuses on solving engineering problems

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,350
by setting aside distraction free time

00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,730
to really think about what the problem

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,860
is that you're solving instead of the

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,070
feature you're thinking of building this

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,720
is true for management as well I suggest

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,100
removing yourself from all distractions

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,360
and cutting out some time on your

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,670
schedule where you're suddenly

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,950
out of office so you can go stare off

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,100
into the middle distance to think do it

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,930
for an hour sometimes do it for a day

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,730
really think the problem through don't

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,350
think about solutions yet think about

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,040
the problems that you're dealing with

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,470
think about what you're trying to solve

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,450
this approach will solve you or save you

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,709
a lot of heartache and trouble it will

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,649
allow you to get to the bottom of what's

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:39,480
happening and what needs to be done

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,890
instead of just patching over what you

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:50,670
think the problem is with a quick

00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:52,769
solution you've noticed something

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,230
bizarre one of your teammates are not

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,640
performing to par won't bother you say

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,339
this will surely go away that person is

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,140
usually a star so you let the few weeks

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,390
pass and then the mistakes are happening

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,950
happening time and again are these acts

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,399
malicious that's certainly fictitious

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,589
you tell yourself to maintain sin now

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,029
your bosses have noticed a slip and you

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:14,070
acknowledge that performance is dipped

00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,079
if you just on your work you wouldn't be

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,740
going berserk because now you're stuck

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,740
writing a pip

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:31,050
that's the sound of a raptor so mistake

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,110
number six

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,520
allowing unwanted behavior to slip so

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,530
you've got somebody on your team who's

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,450
like an extremely high performer

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,460
normally and then you notice they start

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,960
falling behind on things and it's like

00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,790
that's no big deal you think they're

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,420
normally very consistent and humans have

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,920
ups and downs and that's fine then one

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,870
week you feel the complaint that they're

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,810
reassigning all of their pager Duty

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,300
pages like they're jumping all of them

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,220
up and that feels a little odd because

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,360
they clearly know how to address all of

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,460
the problems that are coming through and

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,870
even if they didn't you'd expect that

00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,270
these problems would be well documented

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,460
and would they be taking the opportunity

00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,270
to learn how to do the task and document

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:15,450
them so then one day it hits they check

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,970
in something and it passed a PR review

00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,650
but it broke production and this isn't

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,360
like some things that's gonna get

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,610
somebody in trouble it did pass the PR

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,980
review but there were nowhere to be

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,080
found during the fix and now your boss

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,580
is breathing down your neck because the

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,790
name of somebody on your team is they're

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,620
coming across her desk and now they're

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,050
talking about how unreliable someone is

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,839
on your team and she's ordering you to

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:42,210
write them up or fire them and how did

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,830
it even get to this point now you have

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,680
to write this person up now you have

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,620
that conversation you know they're

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,900
better than this so then you go and you

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,600
write them up and you talk to them it's

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,880
like hey help me out here what's going

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,680
on and it turns out they're a bit

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,420
burnout it's been too long since they've

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,920
had a vacation and they're having some

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,460
family troubles and their head is just

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,410
not in it right now now if you talk to

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,630
them earlier you might have figured this

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,339
out and you could have helped them you

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,960
could have watched their PRS a little

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:15,210
tighter and maybe covered a page of duty

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,640
shift or two or even made sure they took

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:21,360
a few three-day weekends in a row or

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,480
like even or real vacation so remember

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,830
to have the hard conversations early

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,040
because they will only get harder over

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,040
time

00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:37,619
so someone got fired or here comes a pip

00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:39,749
or maybe there's even something more

00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:41,610
scary but it's your job to be the

00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:45,089
messenger and you must do it right that

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,410
part is indeed necessary so you shoot

00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,790
them a message the second you found out

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,920
hey let's chat I've got some news you

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,779
say you don't want people in the dark

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,420
and that's respectable so you feel you

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,799
must tell them right away and so

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,739
communicate to them from the top of your

00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,389
head and that's when things go awry you

00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:01,949
didn't think this through you weren't

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,829
quite prepared and now you're set to

00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:07,529
dissatisfy you didn't want to seem

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:09,199
insincere that is quite clear but here's

00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,939
what the fact is to deliver bad news

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,409
without first rehearsing is basically

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,569
management malpractice mistake number

00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,630
seven delivering bad news without

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,579
rehearsal so at some point you'll have

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,559
to deliver bad news to somebody like it

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,449
might be layoffs it could be putting

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,940
them on a performance improvement plan

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,830
it might actually be firing them the

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,269
point is part of your job is to be the

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,760
messenger and to actor in these

00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,710
situations now so the worst thing you

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,130
can do is try to deliver this

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,080
information without rehearsing it so

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,940
first thing you do write it down write

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,510
down what you plan to say then read it

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,860
pick it apart think on it share it with

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,440
somebody you trust to give you the

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,809
feedback you need maybe a pier manager

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,120
then rewrite it go through this process

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,760
until you're satisfied with it then

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,470
practice it I know it sounds kind of

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,360
hokey but you probably need to have a

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,139
friend or a partner for this one deliver

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,429
the news to them don't read the script

00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:10,710
keep it around though make an outline

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:12,029
and go off of it the point is is that

00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,500
you're not doing this without feeling

00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:15,240
this isn't some cold thing that you're

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,429
doing but you're not being mechanical

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,950
but you're dealing with the life of a

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,500
human and delivering news that could be

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,919
like this could be really really hard on

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,529
them and because of that they deserve

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,049
the respect of you having going through

00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:33,870
how you'll approach them once you've

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,350
done this go sleep on it give yourself

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,210
some rest

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,559
and do it again in the morning make sure

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,510
you're okay with how you feel presenting

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,320
this information then make time for the

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,039
talk once it's time to tell them deliver

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,149
what you

00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,950
planned and then shut up listen make

00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:52,229
space for them to emotionally deal with

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,479
what's going on they're probably gonna

00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:57,629
say some things and it's probably best

00:18:54,479 --> 00:19:00,779
you and internalize those things because

00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:03,690
during crisis people lash out or they go

00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,700
quiet they do all sorts of things but

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,590
what's most important is that the words

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,720
you're getting from them at that exact

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,739
second are not necessarily how they

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:22,379
really feel

00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:24,330
they need time to think - you feel like

00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,639
you're getting this down you've turned

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,379
your team and behavior around all things

00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,820
seem to be a measurable success and

00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:32,580
without much of a mess you're not even

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,200
wearing a frown so you decide to take on

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,720
all the things and something in your

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,340
heart sings you're so excited to be this

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,249
person that you see that you forget what

00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,629
overwork brings and now for the last

00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:44,369
blow your worries started to grow

00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:46,320
because you're burning out and this is

00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:52,309
without a doubt because you forgot how

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:55,679
to say no our last mistake for today

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,389
never saying no maybe you have a family

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,940
maybe you have hobbies you need to take

00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:02,039
- maybe you have school or have medical

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,229
issues or something outside of that that

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,429
takes up your time just know that no

00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:07,169
matter what you're doing you're gonna

00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:08,970
have to make extra time now that you

00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,849
dropped yourself back to junior just for

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,340
studying you will consume books you will

00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,049
consume articles do you know how many

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,099
podcasts about leadership there are you

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,509
can't do any of this while you're

00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:20,549
working because now you're being dragged

00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,989
into meetings all day and it's expected

00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:23,549
that you keep up to date on any kind of

00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:24,899
tech stuff that your company's doing as

00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:26,279
well and you should probably know what's

00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,349
going on for every single team member

00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,379
like where they are in their project and

00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:33,330
what their problems are so maybe give

00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:34,950
yourself a little bit of space from the

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,239
extracurriculars while you adjust and

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:44,070
level up otherwise you are here let's

00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:47,940
make this more literal you are sitting

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:50,970
up here and you were on a stage because

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,289
you decided to take on a talk when it

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,929
was probably not a good time for you to

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,780
do that and you're thinking to yourself

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,190
well at least the crowds go

00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,810
and they run a really good conference

00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,720
and like the food and the drink are good

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:07,790
and can somebody give me a pálinka

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:15,640
because Jesus I'm tired I'm getting

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:15,640
really tired what the hell man

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:24,530
so to start at the beginning

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,850
hi I'm Jeff Lembeck and I'm burnt the

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:32,080
 out on management give yourself

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:36,100
