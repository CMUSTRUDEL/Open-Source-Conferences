Description: 
	Why are we afraid of releasing stuff to production on Friday evening? Mostly because it's hard to know if nothing is broken because manual testing takes time and automated testing was not reliable. (And we really want to go home)

With cypress things are different. In this talk, we are going to cover how to start covering your app with e2e tests and showcase coolest features that cypress.io has to offer.

Automated tests don't have to be boring, difficult to write and even harder to debug. We deserve to have tests we can count on, even when shipping stuff as soon as ASAP.
