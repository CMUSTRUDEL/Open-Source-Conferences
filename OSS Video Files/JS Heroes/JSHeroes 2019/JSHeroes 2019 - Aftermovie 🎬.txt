I'm really amazed by this conference

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,250
it's really unique that Jesse Rose does

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,030
events leading up to the conference of

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,160
health then there are meetups and then

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,330
you get so many more chances to interact

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,309
with the audience I think that's

00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,260
fantastic the audience is really great

00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,120

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,769

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
first time in Romania first time in

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:48,880

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,959
[Music]

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,920
now ya think in general the lineup is

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,140
really great and the quality of the

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,360
talks is really high so I really enjoyed

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,370
most of most of them yeah well it's a

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,880
lot to take in so Tom have it's good to

00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:13,320
just take your breath but it's really

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,320
good it's really really an inspiration

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,799
[Music]

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,879
[Music]

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,440
since this is our general JavaScript

00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,300
conference I think that everyone who is

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,670
involved in web development in any

00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,560
degrees should come here because some of

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,450
those conferences are quite daunting but

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,070
here if you do any web development

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,990
you're going to have a lovely time

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,820
because you will learn a lot I've been

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,370
doing web development for six years and

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,780
I've learned so much yesterday and I'm

00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,200
looking forward to learning even more

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,200
today

00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:01,910
[Applause]

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,910
[Music]

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,340
yeah it's the second time I'm here I'm

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,840
back to the second year in a row I came

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,489
back because I had such an amazing time

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,709
last year it was such a great group of

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,680
folks I really loved the format of the

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,269
conference you know a single track so

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,180
you can kind of give your full attention

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,030
to everything lots of breaks so you can

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,010
talk to people and ask your questions

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,780
and you don't really get into it which

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,099
is always the best part at conferences

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,629
like this is it's all about the

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,459
community and that's really like how it

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,400
feels being here it's a conference by a

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,200
community for community about community

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,400
in many cases so yeah this year I'm

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,510
really excited to be back and I'm also

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,940
really excited because I feel like

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,340
there's even more of a focus on the kind

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,260
of human side of things the talks have

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,300
been amazing so far so just looking

00:02:46,260 --> 00:03:20,210
forward to seeing the rest of them today

00:02:49,300 --> 00:03:20,210
