Description: 
	In this talk, Jess Bowden introduces the area of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and a basic introduction of its principles. She uses Python and some of its fundamental NLP packages, such as NLTK, to illustrate examples and topics, demonstrating how to get started with processing and analysing Natural Languages. She also looks at what NLP can be used for, a broad overview of the sub-topics, and how to get yourself started with a demo project.
