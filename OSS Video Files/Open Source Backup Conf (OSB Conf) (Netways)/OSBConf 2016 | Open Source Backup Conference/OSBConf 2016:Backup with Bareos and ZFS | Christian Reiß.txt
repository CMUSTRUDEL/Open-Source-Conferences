Title: OSBConf 2016:Backup with Bareos and ZFS | Christian Rei√ü
Publication date: 2016-10-07

Description: 
	Doing backups is great, but storing the data somewhere is a whole different ballgame. You can use tapes, of course; but with always
declining prices and increasing reliability of Hard Disks storing all your data as files is becoming more and more preferable. There is just the matter on how to save them. As single files in a single filesystem, shared across a multitude of servers or even in one large archive. The option is only limited by the Administrators imagination.

In my speech I want to tell you about my experiences with storing all archives in ZFS. Opting for one-dataset-per-host, server-side compression, ZFS Raid and quota enforcement. And since we are all loving the fully automated approach I will show you how to do this in puppet. This option I am presenting you is in production. Hundreds of servers are fully automated with Puppet, Bareos/Bacula and ZFS.
