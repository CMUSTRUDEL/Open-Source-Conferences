Title: OSBConf 2016: Backup Strategy in Clientmanagement with Opsi and Bareos | Erol Ülükmen
Publication date: 2016-10-07
Playlist: OSBConf 2016 | Open Source Backup Conference
Description: 
	In the recent time the world experienced an increasing number of ransomware and fishing attacks. These attacks target the userscomputers and the users directly. Usually the network is secured
enough to resist such attacks on the central infrastructure. In thepast most companies focused their backup strategy to their central infrastructure and datastores. The companies computer clients usually weren’t part of their backup strategy.
This talk will show you a small overview about the enterprise-ready open source clientmanagment system opsi. opsi is a versatile and very flexible deployment and configuration management system for Windows and linux clients based on linux servers. Erol will explain client backup strategies. Then he will show how bareos does fit into the opsi system and how they complement each other.

our next talk is about backup strategy

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,119
in client management with Ops II and

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:30,760
Burroughs and our speaker is Erol Egemen

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:33,129
thank you good morning everyone I want

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,620
to talk a little bit about backup

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:42,250
strategies in client management with ops

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:45,730
II and Piraeus first of all how about

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:50,770
you have heard about Ops II before can

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:57,910
you raise your hands okay how you subsea

00:00:50,770 --> 00:01:00,579
already great for the guys that are not

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,640
raising their hands and have not heard

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,450
anything about ops II before I want to

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,130
say that this talk is not about ops II I

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,830
will talk a little bit about ops II but

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:15,360
it's not an introduction we have a point

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,369
on the exhibition area if you have

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,320
interest and wanted to see how it works

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:30,880
and ask some questions then you're

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:33,820
welcome first my person my name is Errol

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:40,869
Ludemann I'm managing director at you

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:43,420
begin via the UI be gmbh horrible so

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,369
excuse me but I say op C I say not

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:54,759
upside or something like this because

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:58,000
that's sounds horrible for me I'm in the

00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:02,020
first point a developer and elite

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,409
developer in the project and my ground

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,540
or my focus is to consulting or my

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:11,470
consulting support training and

00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:16,180
everything about ops II I met you B

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:22,299
since 2003 a little bit about the

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:24,699
company we was founded 1995 we have from

00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:26,650
the beginning the main focus on the

00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,370
client management so we have started

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,880
with

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:36,849
deploying windows 311 it's a little bit

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:41,709
in the past we have from beginning open

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:43,870
source oriented work life and we are

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:48,130
developer and maintainer of op C of the

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,310
project op C we have 18 employees at the

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:56,680
moment and we are based in the great

00:02:51,310 --> 00:03:00,239
city mines so a little bit about the

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:04,900
talk today I will begin a little bit to

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,260
show you or talk with you about the

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:15,040
motivation of the talk and then a little

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,450
bit about what is op C and then I want

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,880
to talk a little bit about client

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,880
strategies or the client backup

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,560
strategies I want to talk a little bit

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:29,040
about per ears and op C because we have

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:32,829
integration also and we have also

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,359
without burials backup strategies was

00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:39,940
with delivered already with op C now and

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:43,829
I won't take talked a little bit about

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:50,100
these so the motivation of the talk is

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:51,880
what we see by our customers is that

00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,000
normally the backup and disaster

00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:01,780
recovery strategies are always focused

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,440
on the the the central infrastructure so

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,810
you guys use Piraeus you backup your

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,230
clients yeah but that's not normal

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:14,739
normally you have administrator they say

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,570
okay don't put any data locally put it

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:22,150
on a net share so we can back up it

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:26,410
there and they they think in in this

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:30,360
manner and this is not this is not right

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,360
in this new time

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:41,410
sometimes when a client have an issue it

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,950
can cause the company more than if you

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:50,860
have an impact often central service so

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:53,170
if the staff of the company cannot reach

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,990
any service in the central

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:59,260
infrastructure then you say ok I wait

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,980
and I look to the mails or something

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:06,520
like I write a little bit letter or

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,030
something like this but if they have no

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:17,980
client that work then they can't work in

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:19,960
the most cases creating backups for

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:27,900
clients can sometimes save lives and

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:31,630
jobs I talk about because the the newly

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,450
security issues that come up with

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,760
ransomware you you know everyone what's

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:41,470
random is or what is mint with

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:44,950
ransomware other cyber attacks so you

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:52,210
can say ok why can a client save lives

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:55,570
or something you have to imagine that in

00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:00,090
the embedded life for example if you

00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:04,660
look in a hospital and you see what they

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,700
put on the humans machines always they

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,220
controlled with the client computer and

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,740
they are always connected to the

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,820
internet and have Windows 2000 or

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:22,830
something like this and and it can save

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:27,270
lives so before you try to find a

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:30,880
strategy or way to pack up your clients

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:33,820
you have first to bring your client

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,220
infrastructure under control this is the

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:42,750
first task you have to do and how you

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,940
can do that you can do it the top see

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,880
for example

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,070
what is obscene obvious enterprise-ready

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,260
open source client management with a

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:58,260
long long history I have said before the

00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,460
the ground modules or the the main

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:05,130
modules of the functionality is

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:11,070
automatic OS deployment of every Windows

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:14,850
systems and I think since two years also

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:20,940
you can deploy and manage Linux clients

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:25,350
too with one system the automatic West

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:28,890
deployment uses always the when do our

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,840
installers we don't go to the Linux

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,510
deployment and make change route or

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,970
something like we have started with this

00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:39,930
but if you make change route and try to

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:43,950
install a redhead for example with one -

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,460
based boot image then the result will be

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,190
quipped

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,000
through crap because that does not work

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:54,090
and that's not fine so we use like in

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,630
Windows the windows installer in Linux

00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:03,260
we use and in Debian Ubuntu and I think

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:07,860
proceed in redhead anaconda and so on

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:10,140
after the automatic West deployment the

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,400
software deployment will come in charge

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:17,060
and manages the system about over the

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,110
software deployment what you can do is

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:25,620
also configuration management in this

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:29,540
manner so hard and software inventory

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:39,660
and license management for example for

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:44,099
short overview the power of ops II comes

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:50,580
with the possibility to extend the

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:55,440
observe modules and here you see a task

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:58,140
of three modules that are not all but in

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,950
this point I want to say something about

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,760
our life

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:07,490
this model then you can understand why

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:10,890
the I have brought free there because

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,290
what we make is for example installation

00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:19,110
by own shutdown so but what this mean is

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,690
you don't install when when the computer

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,780
starts if you install when when the

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,420
users say ok I go home and I shut down

00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,630
my PC and then the software deployment

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:37,050
will go in task and and will work

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:41,550
this modules are deployed and financed

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,070
by ourselves and then we look the whole

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,030
project for the module how it will be

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:52,860
caused if we sell it into one person so

00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:55,950
then we get number of ICS of 50000 zero

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:58,230
for example and then we don't go to one

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:02,240
customer and say ok pay please fifty

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:05,610
thousand euros so we say ok you can

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,310
participate over the co-funding models

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,770
so we called it I don't know if it's

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,910
normal in the marketing but we call it

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:23,700
co-funding so you you support us with

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:31,260
this development costs and then you can

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:33,450
use these modules but not only with one

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:36,270
major release two major release do you

00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:43,320
buy you use you pay it one time and you

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:45,900
can use it when the 50000 euros are paid

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,990
completely then this modules will go to

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:53,570
the core of op C so open source part of

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:58,500
op C and will be free so thank you all

00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:02,010
these modules was in the co-funding

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,810
before so now it's free to use so you

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,240
can use for example multi-site

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,750
installations if you have more than one

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,320
location where you have to deploy your

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:18,560
systems installation by shutdown

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,660
the third one is where the admins can

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,160
give the users a kiosk or software

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,560
on-demand where the user can choose

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,360
himself which software he want to

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,350
install or not we have a user profile

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:43,290
management for roaming profiles for

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:45,900
example but for other tasks too and the

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:50,070
Linux client management has in the

00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,010
newest version 15 starts for free so you

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:56,100
don't have it's in co-funding now but

00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:02,900
you can use it for 15 times on a machine

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:05,340
and can deploy a machine with that and

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,210
we have also modules for enterprise

00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:12,870
installations here are some examples of

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:15,020
that for example my SQL data storage

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,400
back-end for bigger installations

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,800
normally if you use in the open source

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,610
you get a file back end where the

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:30,560
configurations will be written in files

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:30,560
we have van VPN module that is for

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:37,410
devices that are not in house every time

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:39,990
so if they go around the world and have

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,240
in the hotel connection with VPN or

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,340
something like this and then you can

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,180
deploy your software also on these

00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:52,590
machines without to call them back to

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:59,030
the company we have integration for

00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:59,030
nagios or a singer to monitor the role

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:11,430
client roll-up we have wind capture and

00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:16,620
local image backup that I will will be

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:19,170
talk a little bit later on Linux client

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,450
management I have talked already about

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,210
and we have scalability solutions for

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,279
bigger installations and I mean so two

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,939
thousand three thousand clients

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:34,589
or devices in one configuration central

00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:43,050
configuration then you must take some

00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:48,389
work to bring it to apply it also gives

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:50,579
many many integrations for example the

00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:56,459
Piraeus integration I will talk a little

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:58,649
bit about we have ops II for UCS

00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,509
integration I don't know if you heard

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,850
about it from uni vention your venture

00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,629
corporate server would CS would see us

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:10,529
at school we have kicks and OTRS

00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:13,649
integration from the K PI T that means

00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:18,120
is a open source ticketing system with

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:20,399
CMDB and what they make is they took our

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,829
data from our inventory software and

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,350
hardware inventory and push them into

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:28,850
the CMDB from the ticket system so they

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:37,040
can make change management issues and

00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:38,939
tickets with really hot items we have

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,009
Nagas hissing I think that's my

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:45,480
integration I have talked over it about

00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:49,829
we have with London's median central

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,439
Barberton back a cooperation that they

00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:55,230
have built the pet ml Linux and Pat ml

00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:57,389
windows sets for schools that is grows

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,750
it's a complete solution for schools

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:05,670
with complete infrastructure with two

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:08,730
round options they have a Linux time and

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:13,470
they have linear windows solution what

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:16,170
we have also in-house is Jenkins

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,779
openSUSE build service integration ready

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:24,559
all ready for our test systems and build

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,559
systems and many many more

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:34,510
yeah let's talk about a little bit now

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:38,140
about client strategies if you look on a

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:42,010
client you see some kind of data that

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:47,560
you can split in groups so normally you

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:50,920
have film BS or V Fe now that you can

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,290
backup or not we don't want to look in

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,570
that the second one is the West data

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,380
windows for example system files or

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,570
Linux system files we have software and

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,480
app data so if you have installed any

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,720
software deployed any apps or something

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,420
we have user profiles where system and

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:22,240
software configuration will be hold in

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:27,010
and we have a kind of user data so the

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,700
the last one is for for burials backups

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:34,750
for example what as this was Piraeus

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:37,570
mainly do the three in the middle are

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,880
normally will be done over the software

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:43,600
and client management system because if

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:49,480
they broke then you deploy it again but

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,870
you have other choices too for the

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,910
client backup strategy it's important to

00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:00,580
realize that the client is not like a

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,500
server that's in this case for example

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,720
if you monitor your clients or something

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:09,100
like this then or backup your clients

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,490
then you have always know in the in the

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,390
head that the clients are not 24/7

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,120
online so normally as the staff comes

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,120
eight an eight o'clock morning and go

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,939
four o'clock in the afternoon or he

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,520
comes at two o'clock and you don't know

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:31,720
when the clients really will be online

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,720
and accessible the clients can be in an

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,880
outside of the company I don't think

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,790
that you have a colleague or something

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,460
that go to the server room

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:44,610
and take a server and say okay I take it

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:49,550
with me to home but if you have laptops

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:53,100
or something or tablets also then

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:56,100
normally there are not every time in the

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,940
company clients look every time

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:06,270
different what this mean is you can

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:09,840
standardize all all the tasks how you

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,980
want but if you give this device to a

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:18,480
user then it will not look like you gift

00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:22,260
him in a time manner of two days or if

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,440
he player then it tooks not one hour and

00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,750
use you cannot see the client anymore

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,820
you say okay I have don't give him this

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:36,900
client but you have it now and clients

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,240
has normally no fallback that means you

00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,760
have no rate you have no redundant power

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:48,230
supply or something like this that you

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:51,000
know about or in server rooms so a

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,920
little bit about obscene Barrios how

00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:01,230
they work together

00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:06,360
is we make client management in Piraeus

00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:10,410
makes backups so what we make is or what

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,040
we how we help from our project for

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,960
burials is to firstly and mainly deploys

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,510
a backup client agent and configure the

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,550
backup client agent for the clients so

00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,920
if you have new versions or you update

00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:29,940
you burials and you need to deploy a new

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:32,220
client agent for that then you can you

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,650
can use the ops infrastructure to deploy

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,930
them and and change configuration and

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:41,280
make something other stuff

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:44,330
what newly comes to the integration is

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,900
now that you can deploy Piraeus servers

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:52,780
completely this ops II so you can deploy

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:56,260
Linux of your choice and manages many

00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:00,840
this server client we talk always about

00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:05,350
a client if you also deploy service and

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:08,680
use the El Barrio server package opsi

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:14,290
package to deploy a complete piraeus

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:16,510
server if you have for example a little

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:20,580
bit difficult infrastructure for example

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:24,580
then you can deploy it automatically

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:27,700
about up see what's new is it's for us

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:33,880
new - it's that Barrios supports know at

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:37,170
API and for all Jason I have seen so we

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,570
have talked about a little bit because

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:44,770
the whole communication ops II was every

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:49,210
time in JSON RPC so the clients the

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:52,630
servers and all the parts that

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:58,480
communicate in ops II communicates with

00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:01,660
JSON RPC so you can use now the new API

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,350
to configure it directly from the client

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,350
deployment

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:24,810
yeah what will opposite ship already for

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:30,270
this backup strategies one of the backup

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:35,220
strategy what we ship is obstacle seller

00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,920
integration but I have no information

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,810
about that because it's boring if you

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,200
know Clonezilla then you know how it

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,000
works and it's integrated fully in OP C

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,470
and you can automate the tasks with

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,910
Clonezilla if you like console

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:56,780
Clonezilla obscene local image is own

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:59,640
implementation and the ground tasks was

00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:03,330
fast restore of modification system to

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:07,710
initial state and fast change of

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:12,240
different states or OS systems I will

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:16,650
explain it a little bit now and what it

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:19,140
means normally if you make software

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,870
deployment or east-west deployment you

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,210
use a package based or so-called

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,220
unattended installation so you prepare

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,250
the machine you prepare the installation

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:37,590
for automatic run and then say okay

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:40,430
let's go that's the pros on this side

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:44,070
that you can select individual drivers

00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:47,540
for Linux drivers is not so a problem

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:51,390
but in Windows world it's a big problem

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:56,810
sometimes you have individual selected

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:59,490
software but the contra in this point is

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:03,810
that is really really slow at the moment

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:07,710
so if you deploy a Windows 7 for example

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:10,980
the windows 7 took half an hour or

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,110
something like this if you say ok patch

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,050
me this machine to the newest patch

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:20,730
level then you can wait two and a half

00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:23,760
hours or three hours 4 hours it took

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:26,790
some time because you have to apply I

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,730
think 3 gigabyte of patches in

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:32,910
7.now and if you think that in Windows

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,860
10 is new it's not so many patches that

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,560
you have deployed the first patch day

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,250
was over two gigabytes and patches for

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:45,620
Windows 10 and this was only the first

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,620
patch day and that's horrible

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,230
so the second part what you can do in

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,020
this manner is you can say okay let me

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,940
say I don't want to make the unattended

00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,710
installation and make an image-based

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,390
installation that's cool because it's

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:06,900
fast it's really really fast but it's

00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,480
wasteful for driver servicing if you

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,720
have more than one Hardware profiles for

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:17,010
example or if your hardware change and

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:22,650
your hardware will be changed then you

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:25,110
have to work really really hard you have

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:29,220
high network load on the central

00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:32,570
deploying so you can say ok you can use

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:38,220
multicast too but I can say you that

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:41,250
multicast is not in every infrastructure

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,410
available and not in the client

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,590
infrastructure if you say your network

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,300
admin I need multicast then he say ok

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,910
for the service you can get it but for

00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:57,030
the client you forget it because he

00:24:50,910 --> 00:25:03,210
wants to you don't want to flood the

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:06,290
normal networks so the network load is

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,290
really really high

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:16,530
what makes obviously local image of the

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:21,050
local image is the process of both

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:23,820
worlds so you have the possibility to

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,820
select individual drivers you can

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:29,640
individual select software it's really

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:36,930
really fast and you have low network

00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:39,440
load and how this really works is here

00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:44,570
in a small example

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:48,840
if you have a disk on the left side that

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:52,650
are new no partition table in there we

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:55,020
first start with the prepare of the

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,440
machine and what we mean that the

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,980
prepare of the machine is we took this

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,520
disk and make a ground partitioning on

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,400
this disk so we have a partition for

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,030
system optionally you can say okay I

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,290
want a data partition we have an help

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:19,470
partition I will talk later again and we

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:24,570
have hidden backup partition on the

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,930
local disk from the machine after we

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,880
have done that we make the OS

00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:35,100
installation about the package based

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:38,730
installation so what you make is say ok

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:42,750
we have prepared a partition table and

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:49,070
began to install Windows or deploying

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:54,270
Linux and make all the other stuff this

00:26:49,070 --> 00:27:02,510
what took some time yeah then you can

00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:02,510
say ultimately about the system that I

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,940
have installed the system here and it's

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,300
run and he have data and configurations

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:16,500
and something like and I I won't take a

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:20,370
image now and what he makes is he tooks

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,650
the system partition and makes an image

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:28,140
on the hidden backup partition on the

00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:30,960
local disk what he makes also is he

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,330
saves all the metadata of the

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,440
configuration of this client so if you

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:43,200
have Firefox 42 for example and have

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,320
Acrobat Reader 11 on this machine then

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,470
he will take this meter data and store

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,800
it with some image in the hidden

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,800
partition

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:01,530
and this you can do how often you want

00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:10,510
so for example you can say okay I have a

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,390
Windows 7 installation and I backup it

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,570
on local storage then you can install

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,340
Linux Ubuntu for example and you can

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,910
make an image and then you can switch

00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:27,520
over them so you can say ok I want now

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:29,620
Windows 7 or then in 1 hours later you

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,140
say ok I want a little bit a bundle or

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,060
nice and much must do a little bit

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:41,130
hassle in Ubuntu then you can change the

00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:45,880
system the restore of these will be made

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:53,430
in two ways we have one the image based

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:55,780
restore and back up where you can

00:28:53,430 --> 00:29:00,490
restore and pick up the the whole

00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:04,270
partition and we have difference backup

00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:09,340
in this so if the changes are not too

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:12,550
big then the restore is really really

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,460
fast if you make a difference backup but

00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:18,430
if the difference is too big then the

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,640
system sees ok that took some time with

00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:23,350
meter data because you must build hashes

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,240
and look ok what have changed and

00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:36,010
something then he will go back to the

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:39,280
image based installation we have op C so

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:41,890
we can make something like this we can

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,430
say ok we have an image that we have

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:49,870
took a half year ago of something like

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:54,250
this we have no updates on every side of

00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:57,340
the operating system so what I can do is

00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:01,570
with one click I can say ok restore me

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,120
restore for me this image and then

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,190
upgrades the system and that's why he

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,730
saves the meter data

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,519
where he took the image and then he can

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:15,870
upgrade the complete system with a new

00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:21,009
applied software and then go back and

00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:23,320
backup it again so you have no task for

00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:26,110
yourself you have only to say the OP C

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:31,029
okay do it for me and obviously do it

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:36,759
automatically the local image have an

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:42,789
addition to capture the image what this

00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:46,870
mean is he makes a sous prep on the

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:49,960
image on the in the running machine so

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:54,639
he deep personalization deep personalize

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,529
it and then he can capture this image to

00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:59,320
an installation installation whim of

00:30:56,529 --> 00:31:02,679
installing of DVD or something like this

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,320
and then you can deploy this kind of

00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,750
image with a normal unattended setup and

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,809
you have all the patches and all the

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:16,840
software and all the configurations in

00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:20,169
this image for that reason we prepared

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,870
the winpe in the boot image and do the

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:29,860
capture in the P environment is a pre

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:32,590
environment of Windows if you don't use

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,529
op C local image and you want to use the

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,720
capture so to snapshot of a running

00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:41,980
machine then you can use the vent

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:47,019
capture module that will do this with

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:50,080
normal without local image module how

00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:54,519
this works again you have the observed

00:31:50,080 --> 00:32:00,009
in the left side what we make is we make

00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:03,789
a sysprep on the system partition and

00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:06,279
first of all he make it back up why he

00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:09,460
make it back up because if you run one

00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:11,710
time on the normal running system Sue's

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:18,309
prep then you can use this machine

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:19,570
anymore because it's your it's done with

00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,620
this machine

00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,250
so first of all he makes it he creates a

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,900
backup

00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:34,330
the second task he will do is he

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:36,850
deactivates the OP C client then he

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:42,190
makes the sysprep to deepen D

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:47,020
personalize it by a word so after the

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:53,710
sous prep he starts a netboot and say ok

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:57,700
bring me this machine to the PE and

00:32:53,710 --> 00:33:01,780
that's the second part here he activates

00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,870
the PE partition that's the help

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:08,410
partition before we have created

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:14,610
automatically and then patched the PE

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,610
and and reboot the machine in the PE

00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:25,980
shin now in the PE what he makes is he

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:29,020
mounts the de Guiche air and wheat right

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,280
normally if you deploy a software you

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:34,540
get the DePaul share always with only

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:39,220
because of ransomware on something like

00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,380
this in this point you want to write to

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,280
the Depot share because you want to

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:52,840
capture the image and put it back again

00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:56,650
and then after he mounted the image he

00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:02,890
starts to capture the image and apply it

00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:06,910
to the install them and then he runs the

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:09,100
post product to restore the image before

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:14,860
the sous prep so you can use the machine

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:20,940
again and then sends log files to the

00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:20,940
server any questions

00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:32,039
okay I have some time so I can show a

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:34,529
little bit if it worked so I have

00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:38,069
planned already to show the Piraeus

00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:40,919
integration here and I have hoped if I

00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:43,079
go to the workshop yesterday so I get a

00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,889
machine the Piraeus machine that runs

00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,829
and nearly to the end to the workshop I

00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:53,549
have destroyed my machine so it don't

00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:55,829
work so sorry about the head so I must

00:34:53,549 --> 00:35:00,299
show you a little bit about the normal

00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:06,559
opposite tasks okay this is our

00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:16,019
management all gooey so let me show a

00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:22,289
viewer here in English so we changed the

00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:26,789
localization okay so I must look okay

00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:31,380
what you see here is I have on this

00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:36,769
machine a multi site configuration so I

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:42,949
have to Depot service for example I have

00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:47,910
1000 23 clients in there now it's not

00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:54,479
really all it's it's metadata so so to

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:58,259
play and show you something and what you

00:35:54,479 --> 00:36:02,910
make is the normal task is you took your

00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:06,119
client for example the windows 7 client

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:09,180
and then you see the product

00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:12,390
configurations what means the local boot

00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,130
products so the products that will be on

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:19,469
the software deployment when the OS is

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:23,900
running already you have to tap right

00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:28,229
here is for netboot that means that you

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:31,170
can make peace boot for example to

00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:32,880
deploy the machines so if you want to

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:38,400
redeploy complete machine

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:44,640
you have to you have to have the netboot

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:50,340
product and you have a bunch of ready to

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:53,550
use packages already that we provide but

00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:56,460
we have from data for example a

00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:00,960
repository we have from other partners

00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:04,830
repositories that already have a bunch

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:09,230
of useful opsi packages are already

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:12,240
integrated and that they can use and

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:20,330
only what I want to show is for example

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:23,640
if I set up here the Firefox for example

00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:32,180
on the right side you can make your

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:43,920
customization about this product and

00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:49,590
then you can say this should be the

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:54,090
machine I hope I can restart the machine

00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:58,920
now to show you that but Firefox is

00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:06,060
running already so what I make is I try

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:09,900
a push installation and it will work so

00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:13,950
the client has already a service of the

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,750
client agent is a service and you can

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,390
communicate with the service so we can

00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:22,830
push installations or reboot the client

00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:27,470
or take control over the client in many

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:31,680
ways so you have seen the Firefox here

00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:33,810
normally he killed two tasks before he

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,280
installs and then the install the

00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:44,000
software install the software and then

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:47,960
bring it again so

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,670
if I look here and make a reload I see

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:56,140
this installed and I can say see over

00:38:52,670 --> 00:39:00,890
the client here

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:03,770
what have the software deployment done

00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:08,119
on the machine so I don't most walk to

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:14,390
the Machine and look in what status it

00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:17,180
is if you want to see more I do I say it

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:22,430
again you are really really welcome to

00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:26,630
our exhibition stand here my colleague

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:29,480
and I want to answer all your questions

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:39,560
but if you have directly question I want

00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:41,990
to answer now no we don't have oh boy

00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,920
okay no more questions then we're done

00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,920
