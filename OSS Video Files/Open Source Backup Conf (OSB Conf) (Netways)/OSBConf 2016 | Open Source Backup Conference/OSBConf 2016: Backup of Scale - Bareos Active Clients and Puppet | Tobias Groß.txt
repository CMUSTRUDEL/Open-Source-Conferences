Title: OSBConf 2016: Backup of Scale - Bareos Active Clients and Puppet | Tobias Groß

Description: 
	Using central Bareos servers with hundreds of clients behind NAT can be quite a hassle. To enable the director to reach the clients one portforwarding per client has to be configured. This is a massive overhead in configuration and is contrary to normal server client architecture. To fix this Bareos GmbH & Co. KG developed a new feature called “active client” sponsored by Globalways AG.

With the active client feature of Bareos and puppet as configuration management software maintaining a Bareos setup has become very easy. Just add a puppet Bareos class to the clients definition and the configuration of client and director is completely made by puppet. Even setups with TLS and PKI infrastructure can be achieved very easily using trocla as a password store.
