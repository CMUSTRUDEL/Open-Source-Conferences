Title: Building a Business Continuity Plan with Bareos and Rear, by Gratien DÂ´haese
Publication date: 2016-10-10
Playlist: OSBConf 2016 | Open Source Backup Conference
Description: 
	Business Continuity (BC) Management is often confused with Disaster Recovery (DR) Planning as often BC steps are mentioned as part of a DR handbook. During this talk we will highlight what BC is all about and how to get started with it. Creating a DR Plan for certain key systems is only a small part of BC Management and as an example we will illustrate how a central backup server (using Bareos backup software) plays an important role in DR scenarios of keys systems of your datacenter.
We will explain how Relax-and-Recover (rear), a Linux DR tool, can be integrated with Bareos backup software to fill the DR gab and as such using Bareos to restore the system from scratch again. Using the right tools for each task, rear for the bare-metal preparation and Bareos for the restore, is the perfect match.
