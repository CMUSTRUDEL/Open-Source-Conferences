Title: OSBConf 2016: The Database Backup is done - what next | Jörg Brühe

Description: 
	“Nobody wants to do a backup – but everybody demands a restore”: This is a pointed description as seen by many system or database administrators.
Only the fact that restore cannot be had without backup ensures that they are given the resources for backup.

But creating a backup does not settle the matter. In their very own interest, admins must ensure that restore will really work, that the backup has no
hidden damage or is otherwise unsuitable. So a test system is needed to perform and verify a restore.

The result should not be simply overwritten: It is real live data, available on a system which is neither loaded nor changed by production!
These are perfect conditions to do load-intensive evaluations, create excerpts for billing or anonymize the data so that they may be used as snapshots for
developments and tests.

All this can be automated, and data privacy rules can be fit in.

I will present the relevant scripts and settings of a MySQL setup with about 30 production instances (each a master-master replication), from which you
may take the concepts and code snippets that fit your environment.
