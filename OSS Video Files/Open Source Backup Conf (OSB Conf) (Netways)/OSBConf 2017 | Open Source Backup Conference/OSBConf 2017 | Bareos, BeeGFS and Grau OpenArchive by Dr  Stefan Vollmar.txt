Title: OSBConf 2017 | Bareos, BeeGFS and Grau OpenArchive by Dr  Stefan Vollmar

Description: 
	We have presented some of our concepts at the OSBC 2014 and have expanded our original setup over the past three years.

The Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research operates several brain scanners for human and animal studies. Imaging techniques used here comprise magnetic resonance imaging  MRI  and positron emission tomography  PET . We now also use other data intensive acquisition methods like advanced microscopy techniques.

Research is often interdisciplinary with very heterogeneous characteristics of data and analysis methods. Backup requirements range between file systems with literally millions of very small files to files of 200 GB+ size.

Good Scientific Practice mandates backup/archiving primary data and everything else needed to reproduce published results  tools, documentation of tool chains, intermediate results  â€“ which is a veritable challenge in a high-end, dynamic lab environment.

We use a Quantum i6000  LTO-6  tape library with Grau OpenArchiver as HSM frontend  backup-to-disk using WORM tapes; one job per file; file archives 5 GB; mostly unixoid backup clients .

We present our experiences with several types of backup clients and, in particular, our strategy for backup and archiving of data from our Bee GFS parallel file system where we have some candidates for the new incremental forever paradigm.
