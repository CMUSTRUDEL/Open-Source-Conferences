Description: 
	In this presentation we will talk about examining bareos logs within the log-management tool elastic. You will hear something about how you can gather the logs in the right way.
After collecting the logs it is also handy and awesome to inspect the collected data with kibana.
After that i will also show you some enhanced filter methods to structure received debug logs of all three daemons so that it makes more sense. That makes it possible to visualize the workflow of bareos debug output in the same order as it happens.
