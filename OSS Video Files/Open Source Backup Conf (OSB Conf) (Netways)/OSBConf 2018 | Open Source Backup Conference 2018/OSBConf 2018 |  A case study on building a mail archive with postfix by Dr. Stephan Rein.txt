Publication date: 2018-10-04
Playlist: OSBConf 2018 | Open Source Backup Conference 2018
Description: 
	A mail archive is a system that captures all inbound and outbound mail traffic. It serves as a secure and unchangeable long-term repository that allows for search and recovery of email messages. Benefits of a mail archive include the protection of intellectual property, compliance with regulations, backup, and disaster recovery. The talk considers several concepts and available extensions to build a mail archive based on the mail transfer agent “postfix”. The features of the different solutions are compared as well as the feasibility in terms of installation and configuration requirements. The talk also presents results on selected performance tests and concludes on the given regulatory compliance, including the more recent European GDPR. Finally, it is discussed how far the self-built solutions are competitive to a well known commercially available Open Source mail archive.
