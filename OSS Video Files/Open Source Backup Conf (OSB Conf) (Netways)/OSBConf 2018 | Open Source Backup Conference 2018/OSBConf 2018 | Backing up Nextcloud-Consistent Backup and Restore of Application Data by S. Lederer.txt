Title: OSBConf 2018 | Backing up Nextcloud-Consistent Backup and Restore of Application Data by S. Lederer
Publication date: 2018-10-04
Playlist: OSBConf 2018 | Open Source Backup Conference 2018
Description: 
	In this presentation we demonstrate how to backup your application data using Nextcloud as an example. Nextcloud stores user data in files and in a MySQL database. To back it up correctly, you need to store a consistent state of the file system and the database. For example, the database tables contain information about which files are present in the file system.

Several possible configurations are shown, from simple to increasingly advanced, which demonstrate how to ensure a consistent state in your backup, and after a restore. The final configuration will use the bareos_percona plugin for the most efficient MySQL backup and point-in-time recovery.

We will demonstrate how to use this configuration for disaster recovery and single file restore.
