Title: OSBConf 2015 | Contemporary and cost efficient backups to to tape by Josef Weingand
Publication date: 2015-10-05
Playlist: OSBConf 2015 | Open Source Backup Conference
Description: 
	Recently IBM demonstrated a 220 TB Tape Cartridge. I will show the future of Tape Technology and the enhancement made in Tape Storage. Also I give an outlook in Hard-Disk and in Flash Technology. The roadmap in areal density and capacity growth in those different technology will force us to rethink our backup storage architecture in the future. I will discuss and compare those different storage technologies areal density, roadmap, bit error rate, cost and power consumption. I will calculate some example related to backup environment where not only huge data are stored but also many data processed daily.
