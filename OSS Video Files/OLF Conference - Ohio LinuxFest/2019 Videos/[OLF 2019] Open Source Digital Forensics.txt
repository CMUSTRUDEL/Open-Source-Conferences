Forensic science is the use of scientific method to answer questions ultimately used in legal argumentation. While “forensics” is often portrayed in the media and by prosecutors as a means to answer questions objectively and without room for interpretation, the truth is far removed. Government crime labs are typically run by the same department as the Attorney General—the chief prosecutor.

Furthermore, “evidence examiners,” as they’re often known, are trained to use tools whose functions they do not understand and to report results of the tool in a way designed to turn up evidence of a hypothesis put forward by a law enforcement official. Thus, officials with impressive titles can present scientific-sounding results in a way that impresses juries but by no means advances justice. This presentation highlights failures of government crime labs to provide good work product, the need for independent analysis available to opposing parties, and the role that open source software plays in such analysis.

While some in the industry will deride open source tools as “freeware,” a usually-good-enough substitute for “real” (i.e., expensive closed-source) tools, the fact is that open source software in the hands of a competent technologist provides options unavailable to others—and answers necessary to ensuring a free society. This presentation will discuss the use of open source tools in forensic data acquisition, analysis, and presentation in cases involving computer crimes, child exploitation, violent crimes, as well as civil cases ranging from breach of contract to conversion of intellectual property.
