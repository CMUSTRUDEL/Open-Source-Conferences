	Speaker: Steven Pritchard
Videographer: Ernest Parke

Over the last several years, the Puppet language and ecosystem have evolved and matured significantly. We’ll discuss modern Puppet language features such as strong typing, native iteration, and how Puppet abstracts data from code. We will also demo the latest in Puppet development tools, and we’ll show how Puppet testing works in a CI/CD environment. Finally, we’ll discuss whether or not configuration management is still relevant in a containerized world.
