Videographer: Ernest Parke

Everybody has to start in the industry somewhere, even if they barely know what HTML is. Come learn tips and tricks to better integrate new members into your team from an “experienced” junior developer. We’ll cover methodologies for assigning work, how to foster open and honest conversations, and how to teach technical topics. All from the perspective of a fresh entrant to Software Development. By the end of the talk, you should feel comfortable in justifying on-boarding junior developers. You’ll be able to identify ways to integrate them into your existing projects and how to best help them become productive members of your team. Because at the end of they day, both you and your junior developers are interested in shedding that “junior” line from their title as quickly as possible.

all right great all right thank you guys

00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,999
everybody for finding your way back from

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,830
lunch and joining me I imagine we'll

00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:14,200
have more people trickle trickle in as

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,879
time progresses but my name is Robin

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,460
Clower and today I'm going to be giving

00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:20,170
you a presentation on integrating junior

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,609
developers into your team and making

00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,449
sure they're productive members of your

00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,119
society

00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:27,189
so before we start about what we do want

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,619
to have happen what I want to emphasize

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:33,760
is what we do not want and what we do

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:36,010
not want our red shirts so we don't want

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,110
people who in their first foray into the

00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,460
developing world just like really

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,309
struggle with what we're trying to teach

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,660
them step on a rock and blow up get

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,149
overwhelmed by all the technical jargon

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,730
get fazed by a blaster we want people

00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,890
who you know are really gonna learn from

00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,609
us get contributed members of the team

00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,989
and eventually maybe someday they could

00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,100
be killed off dramatically in a season

00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,859
finale so Who am I I already said my

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,440
name is Robin flower and my career path

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,210
unfortunately I was a redshirt I started

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,130
as a high school math teacher and on my

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,560
first expedition down to the high school

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,170
and I was killed brutally massacred by

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,580
the students that were there as a

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,140
consequence I decided to become a

00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,200
developer and became a junior developer

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,329
and eventually after enough time and

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,100
hard work I became a productive team

00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:26,170
member currently I'm an associate

00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,479
developer at work State consulting a

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,670
consulting firm that's just right down

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,040
the road at North Market it's right in

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,990
that area quite a cool place to work we

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,850
also have a booth next door you should

00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,500
go say hi to the people that are at that

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,329
booth afterwards you can get a free

00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,829
little Lego like that it's a squishy toy

00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,409
but you can also connect them pretty

00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,090
great at work State I've worked with

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,700
Drupal I've worked with Liferay and

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,140
currently I'm on site with Chemical

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,360
Abstracts services working in more

00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,890
DevOps you role so I started as a web

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,500
developer but I'm kind of broadening my

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,829
basis so what I'm going to be talking to

00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,570
you about

00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,000
well for starters we're going to be

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,100
talking about how to onboard people with

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,289
onboarding best practices next step

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,050
phasers just done replicable technology

00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,220
setup then I'm a doctor not a teacher

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,410
we're going to be talking about

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,970
effective technical teaching methods and

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,920
finally we're going to teach you how to

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,599
live long and prosper and how to really

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,170
great these developers into your team

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,700
and how to develop them further so let's

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,230
get started all aboard the USS

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,750
Enterprise with onboarding best

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,280
practices so the first thing that you

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,220
want to do is have a good day one

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,140
experience with your developers the most

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,000
important thing is to have a computer

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,650
available for them if you don't have a

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,610
computer available then that probably

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,500
means they're gonna be spending the

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,850
entire day looking over somebody's

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,450
shoulder they're gonna be feel really

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,980
awkward

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,530
you're wasting their time you're wasting

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,330
your money none of that's good this

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,250
allows them on day one to be able to

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,190
customize their computer preferences on

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,780
day one at my job at work state they

00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,890
told me hey get rid of all the stuff

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,750
that you have on Windows you're

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,700
switching over to and Boone - that was

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,209
my first time with Linux so I mean

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,100
that's what brought me here next you

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,500
need to plan a team meeting or a team

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,120
lunch preferably if you have remote

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,860
employees who like to work remote but

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,660
they're gonna be on the team try and

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,670
bring them in that one day make sure

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,650
that everybody is there and that this

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,660
junior developer has time to mingle -

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,060
cooperating to communicate with the team

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,140
members if they feel like they know all

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,730
the different people on their team

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,620
they're not going to feel bad about

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,579
asking different people questions and

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,560
that's going to be one of the most

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,820
important things for them to develop is

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,180
to be able to have a solid base of

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,620
people that they can ask questions lunch

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,120
is a great way to do that if you can

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,650
take them out to lunch that's an

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,090
excellent opportunity if you can't

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,630
pizzas pretty cheap Little Caesars

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,060
pretty cheap next up you want to assign

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,920
a buddy team member so this is gonna be

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,690
somebody who's at the similar level as

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,489
them it's gonna be somebody that they

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,709
can ask the stupid question for instance

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,480
when I started working in Linux I was

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,700
like what did he mean when he said seedy

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,260
up the directory just like completely

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,090
different world to me I didn't

00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,859
understand that type of thing and if I

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,810
was trying to talk to some senior level

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,940
programmer they'd look at me like I was

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,380
stupid and said I had a buddy who had

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,480
been there for like a year longer than I

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,709
had and he could he could understand

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,510
where I was coming from with these

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,940
stupid questions

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,019
but you also want to make sure that

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,730
they're going to be able to communicate

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:17,079
with each other pretty well so you're

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,329
gonna want to try and put them in the

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,489
same general area the communication

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,229
barrier between having somebody all the

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,240
way across the office who is your buddy

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,460
and having somebody who is like two feet

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,540
away that's a huge difference you're

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,070
much more likely to

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,810
on somebody with the basic questions

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,460
that you need to get started if they're

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,980
right there as opposed to having to go

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,440
all the way across next you want to keep

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,000
it low Stig's so on day one you just

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,460
want them to feel relaxed get them to

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,630
know the people get them to know the

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,740
type of environment that they'll be

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,900
working on but you don't want to

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,070
overload them with here's 50 billion

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,910
things that you need to learn in order

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,740
to do your job

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,420
especially for junior developers they're

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,130
gonna feel very overwhelmed this is

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,620
probably one of their first job since

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,910
college or coming out of college so it's

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,930
gonna need to be a more welcoming

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,240
friendly environment the HR site pay

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,910
Corps says the 58 percent of employees

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,040
who are likely to stay at a company if

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,540
they have a good onboarding program so

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,860
if you make sure that you're onboarding

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,330
your employees well at the beginning

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,340
then they're gonna be productive members

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,020
of your team for a lot longer than

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,570
somebody who you just kind of slap -

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,060
okay here's your stuff go do whatever

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,160
you need to do but onboarding doesn't

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,860
stop with the day one it also continues

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,590
into future weeks so in weeks one

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,000
through ongoing your responsibilities as

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,980
a team member or as a team lead

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,870
especially one you want to make sure

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,940
you're maintaining documentation on

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,720
tools and how to install tools and

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,430
everything like that

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,530
and that's a really big one because if

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,510
you just say hey install Linux install

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,520
this IDE install this they're gonna be

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,290
very overwhelmed very quickly whereas if

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,790
you give them a step-by-step guide here

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,260
the things that you need in order to do

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,480
your job they're gonna have a much

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,830
better idea of what they need and will

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,690
actually be working on one of those in a

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,910
little bit next you need to have

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,340
confidence building mini deliverables so

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,260
if you just say learn get that's not

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,820
helpful at all in fact that's going to

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,520
be very intimidating they're going to be

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,590
confused if instead you said I'd stand

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,150
up tomorrow I want you to give us five

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,310
get commands that you think are useful

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,930
then that's giving them a very specific

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,090
timeline that's giving them a very

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,380
specific idea of what you expect from

00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,030
them and they're going to be able to

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,410
present that when they present that to

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,120
you then you're going to be able to say

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,790
hey those are really useful get commands

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,560
here a couple more or honestly we don't

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,390
use those ones that much instead I would

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,370
look in this direction if you give them

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,870
these type of mini deliverables that'll

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,000
help them feel a sense of accomplishment

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,490
it actually achieving something

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,160
definitive instead of just I learned git

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,050
it's I did this presentation and it'll

00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,140
give you a good idea of where they are

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,780
at as a developer

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,730
or check in on your buddy system on a

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,740
regular basis so make sure that your

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,150
buddies are actually communicating with

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,190
each other if they're not them there's

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,110
some sort of breakdown maybe your new

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,880
employee is too nervous about asking

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,990
your buddy questions and you need to get

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,600
them with somebody who's a little bit

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,840
more chill maybe they don't get along at

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,240
all just figure out if that thing is

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,700
working next you need to provide

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,320
contacts within your organization so

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,420
that they're not bugging the same person

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,600
every single time it's really draining

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,330
as somebody to have somebody constantly

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,070
asking you questions and it's draining

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,870
to be the person constantly asking

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,490
questions if you can ask like five

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,990
different team members hey I had a

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,310
question about get I'm gonna ask you hey

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,140
I had a question about Front and develop

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,550
and I'm gonna ask you then you feel like

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,080
you're spreading out your questions more

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,670
and you're more willing to communicate

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,350
next you want to communicate flexible

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,700
but defined timelines most junior

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,470
developers are going to be coming

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,660
directly out of school they're going to

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,000
be used to their teachers saying on

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,130
Friday at 3:00 p.m. you have to have

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,110
this assignment in my box something like

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,330
that if you're giving them a flexible

00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,490
but fine timeline say you need to

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,650
install Ubuntu onto your machine in two

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,090
days and they're giving you you're

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,190
giving them that time line they know

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,080
approximately how long you think it

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,640
should take they're gonna work towards

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,770
that time line and it's not just gonna

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,360
be this nebulous like well I feel like I

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,920
did a lot at work today but I didn't

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,890
actually get it done it's like yeah in

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,600
two days I was able to install this it's

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,190
not all your responsibility though and a

00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,080
lot of it has to do with your junior

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,210
developer they have the responsibility

00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,220
to actually set up the technology if you

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,020
give them a really good document of how

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,370
to go through your technology and set it

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,550
up if they're not following that

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,990
document then that's their problem they

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,430
need to also make sure that they're

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,050
documenting pitfalls for future

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,120
onboarding so if they run into this

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,620
problem in setup and they try and set it

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,060
up multiple times and keep on running

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,130
into this problem they should probably

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,990
be writing that down in the onboarding

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,280
document say hey if you get this error

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,140
it's because you don't have the right

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,670
permissions on this directory and they

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,740
can write down here is the way to change

00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,270
their permissions if they're reading

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,250
this and that gives you a good idea of

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,130
where they're at and it also helps

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,050
onboard future people if you give them

00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,330
many projects that they need to do then

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:59,930
they also need to deliver on the

00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,720
it could be something like have a Linux

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,520
distribution up and running and they

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
give you the distribution they say hey

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,490
look I got all this up and running that

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,650
could be a mini project but they

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,810
actually need to do that they need to

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,510
rely on their buddy hey I accidentally

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,310
deleted the entire git repo okay did you

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,710
delete the entire git repo or did you

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,630
leave your entire git repo two very

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,100
different things have a buddy that they

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,770
can talk to you for stupid things like

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,020
that they need to talk to the variety of

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,310
sources that you're cultivating don't

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,470
just ask the same person the same

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,360
questions and lastly they need to meet

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,070
deadlines or at least communicate why

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,740
they're not going to be able to meet

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,510
deadlines so let's say it takes them a

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,580
lot longer than I expected to set up

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,490
this Linux server or their their Linux

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,900
laptop then if they just say I'd stand

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,450
up two days later yeah I haven't been

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,600
able to do that then that's that's a big

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,090
big red warning beacon if instead they

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,070
cued you in with the entire process said

00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,900
hey I'm really struggling getting this

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,850
onto a flash drive getting this boot up

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,130
sequence started like a day and a half

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,820
earlier then you could give them that

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,560
advice that hint how to do this so if

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,390
they're communicating with you even if

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,310
it takes them way longer than you expect

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,080
for them to get stuff set up as long as

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,850
they're communicating why they're

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,680
struggling then that's going to be fine

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,900
you can work on the speed in the long

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,220
run if they're not communicating with

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,300
you you really need to work on that

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,980
communication opening those pipelines so

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,270
with a junior developer structure is key

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,920
like I said most of these people are

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,020
coming out directly from high school or

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,790
college and they're going to be coming

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,560
from a very regimented structure you

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,550
need to be at this class at this time

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,370
with these homework assignments

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,960
completed so you need to have this

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,460
technical onboarding document that you

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,610
can give them say here's the structure

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,860
for setting up your thing this will help

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,420
them help themselves and just instead of

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,400
just giving them a whole bunch of random

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,680
confluence pages you can say here's what

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,540
you need then that's great they need to

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,360
you need to communicate your

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,750
expectations clearly and so I know a lot

00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,750
of product

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,339
can about plank like a CSS pre-compiled

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,050
it and they're gonna be so confused by

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,269
what you just asked that they're not

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,040
going to have any sort of good idea of

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,889
what it is exactly that you want or

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,630
they'll be just learning this stuff but

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:16,250
not have anywhere to show you that

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,170
they've actually learned it so if you

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,399
communicate expectations clearly like I

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,690
talked about with the mini of the

00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,899
Liberal Bulls then that's going to help

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,000
a lot and lastly you want to set some

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,130
goals so some short-term goals might be

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,290
something like get Linux up and running

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,910
a long term goal they could say

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,100
something like in a year I want to feel

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,230
like I understand how to use git and

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,970
that's a really big deal and if they

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,589
look back on that goal in a year from

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,819
now and they're like wow I really had

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,160
that as a goal like I didn't know what a

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:45,019
bash command was and now all of a sudden

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,430
I do like they're gonna have a good

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:48,050
feeling of accomplishment that they

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,040
gained a lot of knowledge over the

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,569
course of the year they're not going to

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,009
feel like imposters that have joined

00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:55,339
this industry they're gonna feel like

00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,600
they actually know what's going on so

00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,269
now we're going to do a little activity

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,040
it's a self-reflection activity so I

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,649
want you to get out some paper or your

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,230
phone or something and we're going to

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,939
for four minutes write down one positive

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,790
and one negative onboarding experience

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:13,610
that you've had so like at my last

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,709
company I was they did a really good job

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,589
of getting me with a buddy but they also

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,899
didn't do a great job with making sure

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,120
that my expectations were set clearly

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,370
and lastly one positive and one negative

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
about your team's most recent onboarding

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,000
so that the team that you are on what's

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,439
something that you did well while

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,120
onboarding this person and what's

00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,620
something that you did poorly all right

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,189
so you got about four minutes go ahead

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,189
and write this out

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,740
alright there's a little bit of time

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,940
left but I trust that gave you some time

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,080
to think so go ahead and raise your hand

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,860
for me raise your hand up okay

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,420
high-five somebody nearby you nearish

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,220
bye it ought to be right next to you

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,420
that's gonna be your partner I want you

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,100
to talk through some of these things

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,390
that you talked about so some of the

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,830
things that you wrote down actually

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,150
communicate what were some things that

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,930
you did well what are some things that

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,370
you could do better

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,520
alright go ahead and talk for a little

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,520
bit

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,380
all right I realize there's still a lot

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,770
of really good conversation going on but

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,050
for the sake of time we're gonna move on

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,910
alright so let's get started moving on a

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,620
little bit I hope that you'll be able to

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,350
take some of the experiences that the

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,660
people that you talk to had and really

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,720
apply them to your workplace if somebody

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,950
only had bad experiences maybe that you

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,780
shall help share your positive

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:58,050
experiences with them so that they had a

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,670
better idea or maybe somebody said that

00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,810
they actually didn't like structure but

00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,670
trying to figure out a way that you

00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,680
could communicate structure without

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,540
seeming overly structured like if you're

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,760
at a start-up and you you vibe off of

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,440
that no structure type thing try and

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,130
communicate like hey you still have to

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,320
do your job alright so yeah it's hard I

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,910
know next we're gonna talk about how to

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,160
set your phasers to stun so how to

00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,390
actually set up your technology and so

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,590
that last activity was the only one

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,200
where you have to talk to people but

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,580
it's not our last activity instead we're

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,440
going to do what tech your junior

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,660
developer needs so for this activity on

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,820
that same piece of paper and an email

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,070
draft or in a note app go ahead and

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,350
write down all the tech the hardware or

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,390
the software languages that you use on a

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,080
daily basis think through your entire

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,730
day from starting at work till the end

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,650
of the day include your version number

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,140
if it's important like if it works on

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,910
PHP 7 but not on 7.2 make sure you're

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:57,540
writing that down so go ahead and write

00:19:50,910 --> 00:20:00,120
that down for about 2 minutes this list

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,830
could be massive by the way yeah so

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,450
don't feel bad if you don't get all of

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,140
it but make an honest attempt to try to

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,140
get as much as you can

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,610
I'm also throwing some suggestions on

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,790
the screen that might kickstart your

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,790
brain

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:44,390
need to make sure you're off of your off

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:46,250
of Python - too small that pains some

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,429
people in the room I guarantee you they

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,429
die

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,039
okay again I know you're probably still

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,649
working on your list but we're gonna

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,929
move on a little bit next to all of

00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:22,539
these I want you to assess what

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:23,620
technology you use and I want you to

00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,289
categorize it

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,970
so categorize it as either not important

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,799
which would be an ni so this is

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,960
something that either they don't need at

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,309
the first couple months or it's just

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,630
something that you use that it's

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:37,240
honestly not that important

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,679
I is either installed so it's something

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,149
that they can install and forget about

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,980
it for me that might be like an Apache

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,510
server it was really easy to install and

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,159
then completely forget about it I didn't

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,690
need to know the inner workings or its

00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,890
intuitive so something like slack or

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,020
Chrome you're not going to need to teach

00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,610
them how to use it and then you should

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,220
be things that you actually need to

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,529
understand in order to know how to use

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,909
it so something like knowing how to run

00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,679
bash commands that's something you need

00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,029
to understand in order to run it or at

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,770
least you need to know the bash commands

00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:04,840
these are things that you'll probably

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,340
need to teach so go ahead and write

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,870
those letters next to all of the

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,289
different technologies that you wrote on

00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,289
your list

00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:14,580
and I not important so here's my list

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,099
again and I've sorted it by not

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,929
important that important then you for

00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:20,820
understand so you can see that there's

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:22,229
about a column of not important stuff

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,210
this is something that I wouldn't have a

00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:26,220
junior developer install or a new member

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,359
of my team install when they join me at

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,690
the time I was working a lot on

00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,889
accessibility so I had some like

00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,779
accessibility things or some amp

00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:35,519
validators you probably don't need that

00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,679
if you're just starting out I are the

00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,779
things that are relatively intuitive

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,359
like you might not know sequel commands

00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,519
but honestly in my job all I had to do

00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,049
was run one database command at the very

00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,779
beginning and that was it it just fired

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:52,229
off the database you you'll notice is

00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,779
half of my column so like a lot of stuff

00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:57,479
that they have to understand so what I

00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,950
want you to do as homework is try and

00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,599
make your list a living document this

00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,940
could be a confluence page that you have

00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,649
in your organization or a Google Doc I

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,989
want you to share it with your team

00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:08,970
members via your team driver confluence

00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:11,489
and ask them to add all the stuff that

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,649
they use on a regular basis try and get

00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:15,779
a good list of everything that your team

00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:17,999
uses and so that way you have a good

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,399
idea a of what everything uses and be

00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,720
when you start with a new employee you

00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:23,190
can just say here are the really

00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,779
important things so you need to install

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,340
at the beginning here are the less

00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,159
important ones that are useful in the

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,529
long run I want you to work a nice time

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,909
based off of logical and logical steps

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,830
it doesn't make sense for somebody to

00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:38,369
try and install their IDE before their

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,799
distro then add time estimates next to

00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,149
all of these and junior developers are

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,070
coming from a background where they

00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:46,229
honestly don't know that much so go

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:48,570
ahead and multiply your time estimate by

00:25:46,229 --> 00:25:49,950
like four or five six times what you

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,929
think it should be and that seems like a

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,330
lot but if it takes you two hours to set

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:57,029
up a new distribution of Linux it might

00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,950
take them like three four days honestly

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:02,429
it could be that extreme just because

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,470
they're not used to this at all if you

00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:07,529
can find helpful resources that you

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,550
always go back to there are lots of good

00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:10,500
resources out there

00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,480
that are available so right in those

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,610
resources and add in hyperlinks to like

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,690
here's confluences page on how to use

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:20,730
get it's super helpful and finally share

00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,290
this anytime you have a new developer

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,940
make sure you're giving this is one of

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,440
your onboarding documents here all the

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,780
things that you need to do in order to

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,370
jump or have your job effective and you

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,960
can assign them cards or assign them

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,540
tasks based off of the order of

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,010
importance that you decided on so that's

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,750
actually your homework if you have to

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,220
set an alarm or something like that on

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,460
your phone so that you actually do it

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,870
the time that you spend making this and

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,970
actually doing this homework is going to

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,220
save hours and hours and hours of

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,110
questions and your life when you hire on

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,390
a new developer even not a junior

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,710
developer just a developer it's going to

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,510
make it a lot easier to get new people

00:26:52,710 --> 00:27:02,700
on board into your team and make them

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:05,370
effective a lot quicker alright so next

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,020
up I'm a doctor not a teacher so I come

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:09,030
from a teaching background I'm used to

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,280
teaching and I know a lot of software

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,510
developers unfortunately aren't so we're

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,920
going to talk about some technical

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,230
teaching methods in some way that you

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,330
can teach effectively so for starters

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,980
you want to bring some backward design

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,000
to the forefront of your lesson planning

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,680
and you want to make sure you're

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,450
differentiating for all the developers

00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,920
you want to make sure your scaffolding

00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,690
to help build their confidence and you

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,040
also want to keep gardeners in theory of

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,200
multiple intelligences in mind okay I'm

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,940
just kidding

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,460
especially in coding vocab and jargon

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,340
matter coding is like a foreign language

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,320
if you take somebody from China and you

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,200
move them here and then you say hey why

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,760
don't you know the word for water bottle

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,290
you're not gonna act like they're an

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,180
idiot for not knowing that word they're

00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:53,370
not used to your language they're not

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,470
used to your environment when somebody

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,630
joins our organization our coding

00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,220
organization and there's somebody who

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,750
has never learned to code or they're

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,310
they're just starting off in their

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,230
coding you're gonna be speaking

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,580
literally a foreign language to them if

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,410
you say something like C D up a

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,600
directory or go ahead and nano that or

00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,480
by that they're not going to know cat

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,560
cut that thing and go over here they're

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,350
not going to understand what you're

00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,060
talking about so you need to make sure

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,470
that you're slimming down your vocab and

00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,360
you're making it understandable

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,700
neat your junior developer where they

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,289
are

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,169
and the best way to know where they are

00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:28,779
is to keep this idea in mind I like to

00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:30,309
call it the tree model of learning so

00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:32,169
your roots of the tree are things that

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:33,549
everybody should know things like well

00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,289
everything at least that you're hiring

00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:37,720
somebody should know how to turn on a

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,789
computer how to read these are things

00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,700
that you should not need to check with

00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,080
them that they know how to do that if if

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,580
they don't know how to turn on a

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,399
computer probably shouldn't hired them

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,049
you need to talk to your HR the trunk is

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,610
where they need to have a solid base of

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:53,200
knowledge so in order to know how to do

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,659
a templating engine they really need to

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,510
understand HTML in order to know how to

00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:01,149
use a sass pre compiler they need to

00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,760
know how to use CSS in order to know how

00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:06,370
to use a PHP framework they need to know

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,990
PHP this trunk is going to be the

00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,700
foundation of all their knowledge and if

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,350
they don't have a really strong solid

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,840
trunk they're not going to be able to do

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,000
anything the branches are the more

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,340
specific knowledge so things like sass

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,380
or Drupal if they're using PHP your life

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,600
right for Java if you're a front-end

00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,070
developer and then the twigs are the

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,809
really nitty-gritty thing they might

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,220
know how to write a pseudo code for loop

00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,990
because they they learned that in

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,240
programming 101 but they don't know how

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,010
to do that in your specific language so

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,240
the twigs are like the syntax the things

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,830
that you would have to look up in a

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,649
dictionary if you were trying to learn

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:41,200
your foreign language the leaves are the

00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:42,700
visual demonstration of the skill and

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,679
this could be something like actually

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,840
having a committed code or having

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,000
committed code or finally producing a

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,059
website something that has a usable end

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,130
product that people can see and you

00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:56,409
can't have leaves without a solid trunk

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,840
you can't have a usable end product if

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:00,700
they don't know what their base is so

00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,320
instead of trying to say hey give me

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,010
this website or why haven't you finished

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,139
this this merge request yet you need to

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,450
work backwards and say like what core

00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,580
elements of your of your tree are you

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,230
missing out on and it's not just me kind

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,730
of making up some stuff in trees you

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,039
actually see this all over the place

00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,769
even if you don't recognize it in video

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:23,769
games you got skill trees all over the

00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:25,690
place Borderlands the Spider Man God of

00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:28,419
War like any video game basically that

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,980
you play you need to learn how to shoot

00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:32,230
your web in order to learn how to swing

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,940
through Manhattan at 40 webs 40 miles an

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,000
hour you need to learn how to punch a

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,140
guy before you can punch

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,760
20 guys you need to think of your think

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,110
of your development in terms of this

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,150
tree what are the elements that they

00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:48,590
need to know before progressing on to

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:51,080
the next level so you need to assess

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,970
your junior developers baseline and the

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,220
way you do this is by asking questions

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,310
when you're teaching about 90% of your

00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,570
teaching should be asking questions and

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,370
these should start with broader

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:06,590
questions so like okay can you explain

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:08,030
to me what what it is and they they kind

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,320
of stumble through an answer and it's

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,570
very obvious that they don't have any

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,270
clue then you can really dive in there

00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:16,310
at worth as if they say they give you a

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,410
pretty detailed answer then you can

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,900
really work with those details and then

00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,360
start asking them narrower and narrower

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,730
questions to really judge exactly where

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,650
it is they're at you want to start with

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,780
these open-ended but leading questions

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,210
so instead of just saying like how would

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,280
you write this function you might say

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,260
how would you write a for loop to solve

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,210
this function that's going to give them

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,220
an idea of what you would expect for

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,860
them to do but it's also going to give

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,600
them enough direction that they'll be

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,190
able to actually think about it so it's

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
a lot easier to come up with the

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,340
solution if you already have a solid

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,060
baseline as opposed to just a very

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,610
nebulous baseline they're also going to

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,080
ask you a lot of questions so the number

00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,150
one thing you need to do is when you're

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,040
thinking about a new technology you need

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,450
to prepare for the common questions that

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,950
they're going to have because if they

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,570
come to you with the same question over

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,190
and over then that probably means you're

00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,990
not giving them a good explanation if

00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,610
you're instead thinking about the

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,130
questions that they might have and

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:14,150
preparing a quick answer then that's

00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,580
probably going to be a lot more

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:18,830
beneficial in the long run I know there

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,300
are some people myself included who they

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,980
get a question on slack and they

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,990
immediately want to fire off an answer

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,460
whereas if you think about it for a

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,500
little bit you might realize that your

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,910
junior developer is not actually asking

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,100
that specific question they're asking

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,510
something a little bit more broad and if

00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,430
you prepare an answer for that that

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,840
includes the solution to that question

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,390
that they asked they're really going to

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,010
appreciate that but at the same time you

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,410
want to avoid tangents nobody needs to

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:44,330
know a history lesson know who Linus is

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,220
in order to get started with their new

00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,030
distribution don't give them an hour

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,290
long answer to a five minute long

00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,970
don't talk down to them and this is a

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,590
really hard one because honestly we're

00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,390
so used to thinking in our foreign

00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,700
language that it's hard to put yourself

00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,290
back into their shoes but the best way

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,300
to not talk down to them is by asking

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,680
them questions allowing them to explain

00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,100
what they already know and then

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,540
continuing to ask them questions and

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,370
that goes directly in with asking

00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,930
questions back you want to check in with

00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,600
them when you're giving an explanation

00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,430
check in with them often so like give

00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,230
them like a two minute long explanation

00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,120
and say okay so can you summarize what

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,800
it is that I just said that might seem

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,380
slightly condescending but it's also

00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,510
very easy for them to be able to say

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,610
what it is approximately you said and

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,860
for you to gauge whether or not that you

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,870
understood it if they honestly have no

00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,340
clue how to start summarizing what it is

00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,960
you just said then they didn't

00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,760
understand anything and so even though

00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,710
you spent two minutes teaching them that

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,420
was worthless time so if you're checking

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,310
in it's a lot better to spend two

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,590
minutes because you giving them

00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,060
worthless information than an hour so

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,190
make sure you're checking in with that

00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,820
often and lastly there are no stupid

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,220
questions

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,630
so don't get me wrong junior developers

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,190
are going to ask a lot of stupid

00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,380
questions but it could be a stupid

00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,080
question like asking a foreign percent

00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,630
hey how do you say the in your language

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,540
the the little thing like barks they're

00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,790
like a dog yeah yeah yeah a dog of

00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,330
course it's not a stupid question you're

00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:17,330
learning a new language okay speaking of

00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:18,470
dogs there's my puppy alright next we're

00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,480
gonna teach you how to live long and

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,340
prosper and how to really integrate your

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,639
junior developers into your team and how

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,960
to develop them for starters you need to

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,310
become a better team member and you

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,700
could be a great team member you can

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:35,090
probably still improve you need to lose

00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,159
the two-mile uphill both ways mentality

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,409
so like back in my day it was really

00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,940
hard to get this distribution started or

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,280
I didn't understand what I was doing

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,850
forget until I accidentally deleted an

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,740
entire repository if instead you're

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,510
giving them the instruction as they go

00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,310
that's gonna speed up their learning

00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:54,440
process significantly sure they can make

00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,970
some mistakes but if you're making sure

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,500
that they have a good understanding of

00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,150
what's happening that's going to be a

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,650
lot better for them in the long run it's

00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,300
gonna be a lot better for your team in

00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,820
the long run you need to

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,100
prepare resources and your homework that

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,960
you have is really useful for that

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,250
preparing this technical onboarding

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,160
document so that they have a good idea

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,540
of how to get started find somewhere

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,940
that explains hard topics well

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,490
especially get for junior developers

00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,620
it's just mystical you need to be

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,600
patient with them it honestly will take

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,970
them a lot of time to do things that you

00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,500
think should be done very quickly but

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,700
you have to keep in mind they're coming

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,470
out this from a completely new

00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,120
perspective if you're giving them the

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,270
time and as long as they're actively

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,340
working on them then they're gonna be

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,990
become useful very shortly I came into

00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,000
this field a year and a half not knowing

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,110
anything about anything and now I feel

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,810
like I'm kind of useful

00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:47,810
and lastly stand up for your people I

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,070
come from a consulting firm and so we

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,320
work with some of our clients and our

00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,120
client might be like hey why is this

00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,380
junior developer taking so long to do

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,450
this and they don't know the whole

00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,920
background of your thing do you say okay

00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,270
well we're gonna work with them we're

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,010
gonna swarm on that car and make sure

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,420
that we get it done you're not throwing

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,710
them under the bus and say hey they're

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,480
just worthless I don't know what they're

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,950
doing you need to make sure that you're

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,270
standing up for them so that way they

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:13,040
feel comfortable around you as a team

00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:15,320
you're also wanting to avoid typical

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,450
junior developer pitfalls so a pitfall

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,760
might be their real weaknesses that they

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,500
never really talk to you about so in

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,610
your interview you're used to asking

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,200
somebody like hey what are your

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,880
weaknesses and they might respond with

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,090
like I really try too hard or I spend

00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,590
too much time communicating with my team

00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,780
it's not real after they've been working

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,700
with you for a month or two ask them

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,500
about their real weaknesses like hey are

00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,180
you a bad for crass teenager if they are

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,020
bad procrastinator they'll probably tell

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:44,180
you maybe tomorrow but they'll tell you

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,840
and then you know okay this person is a

00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,850
procrastinator

00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,380
I need to give them concrete deadlines

00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,560
so they need to be done with this task

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,910
by Tuesday at 4 p.m. and if they have

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,770
that deadline in their mind that

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,210
prevents all procrastination and if you

00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,310
set that firm deadline they're gonna be

00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,740
like I need to do this now it might not

00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,450
be great at that time but hey it'll be

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,250
done and then from there you can really

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,690
work with them on improving it whereas

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,340
if you just say hey get this done

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,380
they're gonna procrastinate and you're

00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,150
never gonna see a end product another

00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,860
one that they might have is discomfort

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,020
asking questions a lot of people come

00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,280
with an impostor syndrome mindset so

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,020
they feel like I don't

00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,640
in this industry I honestly don't know

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,990
what I'm doing here why did they hire me

00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,280
they're paying me a lot of money and

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,330
part of that manifestation is gonna be

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,730
they're not going to want to ask the

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,230
stupid questions so if you really sit

00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,000
down with them and they say hey I've

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,590
just been having a hard time talking to

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,750
people about these type of questions

00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,570
that's why my tasks have been taking so

00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:40,700
long because I try and Google everything

00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,530
then you need to work with them and give

00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,270
them more constant feedback maybe like

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,740
every hour swing by their desk and say

00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,660
like hey what's going on do you have any

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:49,370
problems another one is they can't

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,930
handle pressure so this goes along with

00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,220
it they might feel overwhelmed by the

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,440
amount of work that you've given them

00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,760
and they kind of shut down they they get

00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,890
on reddit for two minutes and that

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,330
happens to be two hours and then they're

00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,280
two hours behind where they were before

00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,530
they were overwhelmed and that just kind

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,580
of snowballs if you're checking in with

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,350
them and making sure they really

00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,480
understand what it is they're doing then

00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:11,120
that's going to help them there might be

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,170
more weaknesses so by finding out their

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,820
weaknesses you're really going to

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,680
understand where they're coming from and

00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,940
what you can do to improve them and make

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,640
sure that they're more productive on

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,470
your team next you want to overcome

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,120
their over reliance on the Internet so a

00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,370
lot of people automatically just Google

00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,230
a problem they google and arrow code

00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,660
then they copy and paste from Stack

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,460
Overflow into the code have them like

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,870
write down in comments

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,790
I know comments aren't great but write

00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,920
down in comments what it is each step

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,060
along the way a function is doing and if

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,620
they don't know then they'll try and

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,090
figure out what it is it's doing and

00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,100
they realize oh I could probably delete

00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,780
that step I don't need that if they're

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,430
just copying and pasting things all the

00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,020
time make sure they're really talking

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,760
you through what it is all the functions

00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,260
are doing so that way you don't end up

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,960
with 30 extra libraries that you don't

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,670
need and lastly you need to provide

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,990
those specific expectations and

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,360
arrangements that's going to help a lot

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,150
I've talked about that I've talked about

00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,680
that a lot that's probably my most

00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,600
stress the thing that I can stress the

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,200
most is provide them specific you need

00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,880
to have this thing done by now and JIRA

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,770
cards writing down really good

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,840
acceptance criteria is one way of doing

00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,340
that working in scrum saying hey I

00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,970
expect you to have this done by the end

00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,730
of the sprint

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,260
that's a really good way of doing that

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,670
code review is also probably one of the

00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,580
most effective ways that you can teach

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:27,380
and so the goal in code review for a

00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,780
junior developer shouldn't be to merge

00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,300
their code and to have it be good if

00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,070
should be to merge their good coat so

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,360
their first PRS are probably going to

00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,220
look like crap they're probably gonna

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,540
like accidentally deleted some files

00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,340
they're not going to know what they're

00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,800
talking about they're gonna have like 30

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,990
extra functions that they don't need so

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,490
overall of the review should follow the

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,900
similar tree model that we were talking

00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,760
about it should start with a really

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,470
broad concepts what are the core

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,000
elements that they're missing maybe

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,920
they're adding in 20 files that they

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,450
don't need you need to talked about and

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,890
talk to them about why they're adding in

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,350
those files if they can't explain it

00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,880
then really hone those down then after

00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,040
those really big problems are fixed

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,870
trying to look for smaller improvements

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,730
so maybe they got rid of all these

00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,020
libraries but now like one or two things

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:11,050
aren't working work on those small

00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,430
improvements and then the last one is

00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,830
refactoring getting the syntax all in

00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,660
getting the spacing correct all of that

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,880
stuff is very minor in the grand scheme

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,560
of things but the longer you hound them

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,930
about it at the beginning of the career

00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,910
the less bad code they're going to have

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,140
at the end of their career so if you

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,940
really work with a junior developer

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,490
right when they start on getting all of

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,770
their syntax and all of their Uncle Bob

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:36,260
stuff perfectly done then that's going

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,790
to be really good in the long run you

00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,680
also in code reviews want to avoid

00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,300
personal attacks and you shouldn't be

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,430
doing this ever but especially not with

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,040
a junior developer I have seen code

00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,810
reviews that they get pretty brutal in

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,640
they're like oh why would you do it this

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,230
way or I've worked with one person that

00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,600
would just put a question mark as this

00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,850
code review comment like question and

00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,380
it's like a Titan I don't know what that

00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,910
means does that mean he's angry at me

00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,640
does that mean I did it a really stupid

00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:03,800
way like it's pretty personal honestly

00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,530
if you instead just give them

00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,390
constructive helpful feedback so why

00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,920
exactly did you call this function what

00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,360
what is this function doing then that's

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,430
going to help them think about it

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,500
comments should be constructive and they

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:17,540
should ask opening questions give them

00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,370
an idea of what they can improve on but

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,890
have them answer you so that way you can

00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,970
check their knowledge and lastly you

00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,830
need to be empathetic

00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,780
they probably it might have taken them

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:28,550
like two days to write this PR that

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,410
would have taken you like 30 minutes but

00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,360
they're probably honestly proud of that

00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,100
PR you're like this might be my one of

00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,480
my first PRS that I've ever made and I

00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,160
worked really hard on getting everything

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,380
right and you're just gonna tear it

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,910
apart that's what your job is to do

00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,800
you're supposed to do that you want to

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,280
do that but at the same time compliment

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,290
them on the

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,030
things that they did well say like hey

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,730
you did a really good job commenting

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,770
your code or you did a good job making

00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,270
sure that it flowed in a logical fashion

00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,740
if you're giving them that kind of

00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,600
feedback as well as the negative

00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,080
feedback that's going to help a ton in

00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,080
the long run

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,610
lastly the summary what you need to do

00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,960
is you need to prepare in advance if a

00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,000
junior developer is going to join your

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,530
team you need to have your Hardware

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,520
ready you need to have your onboarding

00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,080
materials ready

00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,910
you need to have assignments for them

00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,830
ideas of how to integrate them into your

00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,540
team quickly you need to think of

00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,640
knowledge as a skill tree start with

00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,050
your solid trunk work your ways out to

00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,370
the branches and you can't have leaves

00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,020
without a good knowledge of all the

00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,340
stuff that comes below you know make

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,350
sure that you're asking questions

00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,120
checking in with them on a super regular

00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,590
basis and you also need to make sure

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,180
their junior developers they've never

00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,450
done this before you need to make sure

00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:48,500
that you're being very patient with them

00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:49,760
does anybody have questions yes so the

00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,230
question is if you don't have like a

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,240
full office if you're fully your remote

00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,800
how can you do this well a good way is

00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,200
making sure that your communication

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,120
channels are really clearly defined when

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,830
they start the project so like if you

00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,020
just say hey you can get me like via

00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,060
email or slack or whatever then they're

00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,770
gonna never really have a good idea of

00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,570
how to communicate with you if you

00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,250
instead to say like hey ping me through

00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,350
slack anytime you need me whenever you

00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,670
need me just let me know and I'll answer

00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,740
and then you make sure that you're

00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,910
keeping those channels open if they ping

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,620
youth from slack make sure you're

00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,330
responsive even if you are in a meeting

00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,160
and you can't help out right that minute

00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,140
so yeah I'm in a meeting but I'll help

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,490
you in an hour when I get out make sure

00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,490
you're keeping those channels open

00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,330
thankfully I never did but I've come

00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:40,190
very close to it

00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:42,200
it wasn't a yeah I have when I started

00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,550
with git I honestly had no clue what I

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,870
was doing and it didn't help that I was

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,650
trying to use github which in my opinion

00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:50,960
is the worst of everything so once I

00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,360
kind of really realized what just the

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,580
very basic analogy of what good is doing

00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,670
then I was like okay thankfully I'm

00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:25,710
probably never going to

00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:28,109
delete a repo yeah that's a really good

00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,900
point and a lot of times you want to do

00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,849
buddy coding with a new person and a

00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,380
good point of buddy coding it's not just

00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:35,970
to get things done quicker to have

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,069
multiple people thinking in the project

00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:39,720
it's to get people up to speed with the

00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:41,460
project so something that you could do

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,140
is you can work with them and say hey

00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,790
you take the reins on trying to do this

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,680
and then you give them helpful feedback

00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,660
even if you don't know exactly how it is

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,190
that you would do it it's kind of good

00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,450
for both of you to figure it out and

00:44:50,190 --> 00:45:10,349
it's also going to help to build that

00:44:51,450 --> 00:45:12,000
team chemistry yeah yeah so the question

00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,559
is if somebody has really advanced

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,510
knowledge that you don't really have and

00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:16,920
how do you deal with that like you can't

00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,470
really help them through their problems

00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,270
hopefully a lot of the times you you

00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,130
honestly might be dealing with a junior

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,660
developer who's like really good at math

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,670
or really good at stat but they haven't

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,650
used this type of software what you can

00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,720
try and do is give them as good a

00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,000
foundation as you can in the elements

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,980
that you do know about so give them a

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,480
good understanding if let's say they're

00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,710
really good at data analytics but

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,809
they're not really good at setting up

00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,369
their ec2 instance or something that

00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:43,619
might be a completely different area

00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:45,720
their expertise the easier you can do

00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,920
you just give them like a pipeline that

00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,230
they can just start up and then they can

00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,589
immediately start testing that's one way

00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:55,470
that you can help out so try try and use

00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:56,760
what you know to help them but I don't

00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,180
feel like that really answered your

00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,180
question

00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,190
yeah yeah docker is another really good

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,780
one so let's say you don't want that

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,220
huge startup time of them learning how

00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,630
to do all of this stuff you just want

00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,680
them to be able to start working in the

00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,690
environment that they're comfortable

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,770
with you can set up a docker image or

00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,690
something like that and just give that

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,550
and give that to them and say hey just

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,290
run this and this will take care of all

00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,550
that legwork all the crappy stuff that

00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,440
you don't want to have to deal with and

00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,329
just try and make it as convenient as

00:46:23,440 --> 00:47:04,030
possible for them to do the job that you

00:46:25,329 --> 00:47:06,819
hired them to do so the question was if

00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,530
you're in a technical interview like you

00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,359
would expect to know a fair amount of

00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,099
this type of thing at what point is a

00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:14,049
company do you said this person probably

00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:16,119
doesn't have the knowledge and what I

00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:17,559
would do instead of that is try and

00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:19,150
engage in the technical interview

00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:20,920
instead of asking them specifically

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,059
about those type of problems because if

00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,619
they're applying as a junior developer

00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:25,599
they're probably not going to know a lot

00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:27,430
of this stuff try and ask them about

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,349
ways that they've overcome problems in

00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,240
the past so it might not even be a

00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,500
coding thing but tell me about a time

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,690
that you were really faced with the

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,250
struggle that you had to overcome and

00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,290
that'll give you a good idea of like

00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,670
their work ethos and all of that type of

00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,230
thing instead of asking them

00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,599
specifically about the technical thing

00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:45,430
if somebody is a really hard worker and

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,109
really quick at learning it doesn't

00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,430
matter if they don't know a lot of the

00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:51,040
elements that you're going to be working

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,869
on their job in fact I completely blew

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,119
my technical interview I maybe answered

00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,740
like one question correct but they still

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,240
hired me because I had a good enough

00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,950
reputation based off of my other

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,839
credentials that I was a quick learner

00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,700
and I was able to understand things and

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,440
then in that case as a junior developer

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,049
you really want to make sure that you're

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,270
working towards that that goal hey they

00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:12,099
hired me expecting they'll be able to do

00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,630
this in the long run so I'm gonna make

00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,829
sure that I'm enforcing that they're

00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,350
going to be grateful for you to give

00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:17,210
them them

00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,800
giving them that opportunity most junior

00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:21,890
developers are going to come with a very

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,240
limited skill set so it is a it is part

00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:25,130
of your client and maybe if you need a

00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,360
project done in the next month and it

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:27,740
has to be done right away

00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,110
you shouldn't hire a junior developer

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,580
but investing your time in them at the

00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:34,460
beginning when there's a little bit more

00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,080
of a easy period in your work then that

00:48:34,460 --> 00:49:05,960
would be a really good time to hire new

00:48:36,080 --> 00:49:08,420
junior developers okay yeah

00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,370
and that's that's part of so about

00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,870
acronym usage it's really hard to gauge

00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,460
whether somebody understands what you're

00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,470
talking about if you don't check back in

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,420
with them so you're like hey do you know

00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:19,250
what I mean when I say blank blank

00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,380
playing and they'll be like oh yeah

00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,550
you're talking about X then that's

00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,950
that's gonna help a lot

00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:27,290
so acronyms there's a pretty famous Elon

00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,970
Musk email in which he like railed on

00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,770
all of SpaceX we're using too many

00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:32,750
acronyms he sent out like an email to

00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,130
the entire company like hey stop using

00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,390
acronyms you idiots nobody can

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:38,300
understand what you're saying when they

00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:40,130
join our company so try and avoid

00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,570
acronyms as much as possible obviously

00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,420
they're going to be useful a lot of the

00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,160
time if you're using AWS you have no

00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,710
choice but to use acronyms all the time

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,300
but at least make sure one thing that I

00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,070
did as a junior developer is anything

00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,840
that was something I didn't understand I

00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,510
wrote it on a note card and posted it on

00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,270
a right in front of my desk so that way

00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:01,130
if somebody said like what or just fire

00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,660
up the ec2 instance I could double check

00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,090
what it meant when they said ec2

00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:11,180
instance so giving them that that

00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:12,860
knowledge back on it base yeah yeah you

00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,660
could definitely add that to the living

00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,160
document hey we're talking about these

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,600
type of services all the time we're

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,130
going to use these acronyms so here's a

00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,470
quick explanation that's a really good

00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,470
idea yes

00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,810
so he's saying if you're hiring somebody

00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,640
who's like really knowledgeable about

00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,260
Java but they don't know much about PHP

00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,820
how can you make sure that they're

00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,990
actually getting a chance to show you

00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,630
what they do now

00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:02,730
and that's why a lot of technical

00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,770
onboarding procedures are technical

00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,440
interview questions are kind of language

00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,060
agnostic so like tell me about how you

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,190
would do this write some pseudocode

00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,619
about how you would do this element and

00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:15,359
if you can understand what their thought

00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,560
process is then it doesn't matter

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,510
whether or not they've spent all their

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,490
time in PHP versus Java or vice-versa

00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:22,500
you're gonna know whether or not they

00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:24,210
kind of have the basic knowledge because

00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,250
once you learn one coding language it's

00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,569
not a huge startup time to learn the

00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,829
others it's just a matter of really

00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:31,260
putting in the time to learn the syntax

00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:33,480
so give them the opportunity to actually

00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,069
flourish with what they know instead of

00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:50,190
penalizing them for the things that they

00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:51,660
don't know okay yeah so if they know a

00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:55,859
lot more than you do during the

00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:57,750
interview yeah something that you didn't

00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,099
even think of then honestly that's

00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,720
probably a really good thing it's

00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,030
showing that they have a good solid base

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,800
of knowledge and if they're sharing that

00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,079
with you then that probably means that

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,280
it's gonna be useful in the long run to

00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,839
bring them into your company so that

00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,339
they can share that type of knowledge

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:17,849
with your company or with you

00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:19,140
specifically so yeah so it looks like

00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:20,400
we're right about time but if you come

00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,010
up here I can continue this conversation

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,599
with you everybody else thank you so

00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:27,130
much for joining us and I really

00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:33,399
appreciate your listening

00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:33,399
