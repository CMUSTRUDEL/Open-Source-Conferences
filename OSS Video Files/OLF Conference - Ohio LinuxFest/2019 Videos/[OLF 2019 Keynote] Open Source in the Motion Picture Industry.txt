The top 100 grossing movies of all time have some sort of visual or special effects (known as VFX) used in production. And open source is the powering engine behind this. In this presentation, you will learn about the use of open source in the motion picture industry and how you can get involved.

all right everyone got to see behind the

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,340
stage that's the secret of Ohio Linux

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:15,040
foes all right how we record the awesome

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:24,949
video thanks Donnie welcome to the 17th

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:27,679
Ohio Linux fest 17 that's a long time

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:30,410
that's not old enough to drink but if

00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,890
you have a child 17 that's where you

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,260
might start to reflect on your own age

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,110
my daughter is 5 and I'm starting to

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,830
reflect on my age if that says anything

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,210
so imagine that for 17 if you don't have

00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:49,670
kids yourself 17 years and we do this

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,520
for you it's really all about the

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,730
community and you might think seeing all

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,890
this that we have a huge team but

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,670
believe it or not the team throughout

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:08,840
the year is only nine people so big hand

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:11,480
to the organising team in addition to

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,850
that during the event we have seven

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,430
volunteers this year that number goes up

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:19,310
and down depending on the year the

00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,680
volunteers are super important but as

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,950
you might imagine with something that

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,070
has been happening for 17 years many

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:31,640
people have been doing it for a long

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,700
time what happens when somebody does

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,400
something for a long time they may might

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,420
get tired of it now that's not to say

00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,570
that folks on the team are tired of

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:47,540
organizing Ohio Linux Fest for you but

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,030
they could get tired in what would

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,290
happen if we had no one to organize Ohio

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:57,590
Linux fest we wouldn't have it anymore

00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:00,530
so this is my urge to you to consider

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,900
consider volunteering not only the day

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,090
of as many of you do and we appreciate

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,520
all seven who have volunteered for this

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,500
weekend in the mini who have for years

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,550
passed so big thanks to all our

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,860
volunteers past and present

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,600
[Applause]

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,700
but really what that means is we need

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,760
more people helping us throughout the

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,340
year and honestly we've been kind of bad

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,230
at that because we know what we're doing

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,300
and we've done it for a long time and we

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,430
can keep on doing it but we're trying to

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,510
change that and the way we're changing

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,640
that is by creating organizing teams one

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,770
of the areas where we need a lot of help

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,590
is sponsors so we have an organizing

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,020
team through sponsors and Rob our

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,240
sponsor chair who isn't in the room

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,940
right now because he's over in the expo

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,130
getting it ready for all of you talk to

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,510
rob talk to me really anyone in a yellow

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,520
shirt especially me

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,610
sponsor chair talk to rob if you want to

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,680
help us sponsors if you'd like to help

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,600
with our professional training oh lfi

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,870
we're looking for help there as well

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,450
just organizing it not giving it so the

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,520
lift it's not quite as heavy as say

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,040
preparing professional training content

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,150
which we appreciate all of our trainers

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,400
who do that so we have a couple specific

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,610
areas where we really need help but

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,980
generally if you're able to help in

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,660
willing to help and commit and follow

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,209
through that third thing is the most

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,660
important part because if you say you

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,910
help you will help and then we spend

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,090
time trying to work with you that's

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,160
taking time away from work we'd be doing

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:44,519
to organize the conference if you don't

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,350
help so the most important part is if

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,610
you raise your hand and I know you will

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,820
because you're all good people

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,580
not now rhetorically but later when we

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:58,230
follow up and ask for help again you're

00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,769
responsive and engage and that's how we

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,870
will have Ohio Linux Fest for another 17

00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,060
years to come so we're asking for

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,400
volunteers more organizers throughout

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,470
the year and I know we can count on all

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,109
of you to help with that in addition to

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,019
that I want to make one other quick

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,150
point so we have approximately seven

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,460
hundred people registered for the event

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,000
this week and how cool is that big hand

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,000
tall you

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,700
so a big part of Linux Fest is the

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,730
community making it accessible to all in

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,760
all circumstances of life that's a big

00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,110
part of our values but if if you were to

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,120
guess how many people paid to be here

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:51,740
how many would you guess are just quick

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,810
number from some 187 that's close what

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,560
was the other one

00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:01,580
250 any other numbers 105 it was a

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,670
hundred in seventeen so that's seventeen

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:08,600
percent of people who attended paid to

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:12,170
be here this is a very expensive venue

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,110
it's really difficult to organize an

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,080
event where only seventeen percent of

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,630
people pay so to illustrate what that

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,350
really means is if you had a dinner a

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:27,380
dinner party of ten people and you and

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,900
your spouse or partner we're left with

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,300
dinner and you paid for all ten people

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,590
that's what seventeen seventeen percent

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:38,270
of people pain means for Ohio Linux fest

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,550
it's like you'd be in stock for a dinner

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,680
party to people with Ted now it's part

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,050
of our values we want to continue doing

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,190
that but it makes it difficult for us to

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:52,390
organize so I'll emphasize if you work

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,510
for a company that uses open-source or

00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:58,400
you work professionally in technology

00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,400
take the opportunity to engage your

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,950
company and find ways that your company

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,440
can contribute back such as paying for

00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,960
your ticket or maybe sponsoring the expo

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,430
in that way we can keep an open

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,760
community for all

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,430
so to recap this isn't a lecture it's to

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,800
ask for help we're passionate about this

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,620
we want to do it for you continue to do

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,930
it and continue to do it free so it's

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,870
accessible to all but things like that

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,660
will help us keep on doing it so if you

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,970
can help organize and if there's ways

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,919
that you can contribute more financially

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,850
that work for you and your companies

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:41,030
please look for ways to do that

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,770
now I'd like to move on to the next part

00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,800
of our program and I'm going to

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,470

the founders of Ohio Linux buzz so the

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,740
people who could potentially win the

00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,140
lottery and decide that oh maybe 17

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,630
years is enough organizing Ohio Linux

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,150
Fest best beth is one of those people

just continuing this is the lifeblood of

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,220
open source right here is these local

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,850
event these regional events that bring

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,770
together enthusiasts technologists

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,630
everybody in open source together to be

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,310
able to meet and mingle I was fortunate

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,460
to be open source summit Europe earlier

00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,050
this week which if I go off track isn't

00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,020
properly a little bit gently extoll for

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,340
me because I got home late last night

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,230
but it's a really great just to see

00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,180
these communities coming together like

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:49,450
that is just with neat innovation starts

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:53,390
to happen so we all love movies right

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,370
what are the movies we all walk what

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,680
sort of common thread do they have all

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,540
in them yeah

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,190
the on visual effects and if you look at

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,980
all these movies up on there every

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,930
single one of them has visual

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,060
and if you actually keep expending this

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,040
list out like if you get to the top 100

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,800
grossing movies of all time

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,600
they all have visual effects like this

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,420
is something is a very common thread

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,630
between the movies that we lock okay fun

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,940
factor V for the audience what how you

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,990
have to go down to 140 to find a movie

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:31,639
that does not have visual effects in it

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:35,290
anybody know what that movie is no it's

00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,290
more recent than that it's not that old

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,860
no really no they're not high grossing

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,069
no no no it's not your normal it is I

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:56,959
don't know if we have any Abba fans in

00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:59,420
the audience Mamma Mia that's right

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:04,250
Mamma Mia we all look musical singers

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,630
right but now visual effects powers you

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,220
know visual effects is a key part and

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,810
these are the movies that we love is

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,940
that I got some short video here that

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,770
kind of digs into a little bit behind

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:21,140
the scene

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:21,140
[Music]

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,520
every single part of the filmmaking

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,130
process is touched by software and a lot

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,020
of that software is open-source software

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,360
the Academy Software Foundation exists

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,940
to provide a great home for open source

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
projects that we as an industry use

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,480
every day

00:12:42,600 --> 00:13:00,709
[Music]

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:22,860
[Music]

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,350
whether you are a user of open source

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,120
software quite an engineer or a company

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,980
that relies on open source software we

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
want to create the right ecosystem for

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,410
you to get the most out of the open

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,030
source software that you need to use

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,500
find us at a s WF Caio and join the

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,380
mailing list and see how you can get

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:45,350
involved

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:47,940
[Music]

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,520
he's one of the top executive producers

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,500
of the Star Wars series for ILM and he's

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,390
heavily involved I mean this is his life

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,130
what is a VFX and he was sort of one of

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,190
the big founder of big pushers in the

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,310
industry behind you putting together an

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,320
association like this there's one other

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,110
common thread of an open-source that

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,130
runs through all of this and I think the

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,640
folks in this audience are gonna like

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,600
this

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,250
it's linnaeus nexus of thread

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,630
linux is the power this is this is this

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,400
is what you see all these rendering

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,760
farms all these tools all these studios

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,030
are using Linux to do all of this in the

00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,710
back end and so let's look at a little

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,240
short history of how we got from here to

00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,890
from where we're at today to here so

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,290
visual effects is put together in a tape

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,660
line right so many of these studios have

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,010
a multitude of tools there's some of

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,690
them they're coming for commercial

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,980
vendors there's some of them a lot of

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,480
them are actually home burned like a lot

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,550
of you studios and everything that's all

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
these studios right a degree the tooling

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,640
themselves like this there's a ton of

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,740
software engineering that's happening

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,780
behind the scenes here some of this is

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,850
even actually production specifics of

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,520
each production that happens they're

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:58,700
writing tools specific for that that

00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:03,450
string all of the put all those together

00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,490
now the thing that pulls it together the

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,920
thing that pulls all this together is

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,140
open source software all of the key

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,850
parts of this all of the interchanges

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,140
between all of these different pipeline

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:20,070
tools here are built all an open source

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:22,950
now this here is an interesting place

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,780
and for some of you move around open

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,310
source look store aisle this is probably

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,550
your thing okay this is an interesting

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,870
sort of paradox for an industry that you

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,370
know probably there may be a

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,420
misconception or a thought that maybe

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,830
are they really appreciated their open

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,470
stores do they kind of get that how does

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,390
this all come together well so the

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,030
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,010
Sciences which you might recognize as

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,140
the people that put on the Oscars that's

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,420
actually only half of what they do there

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,370
Arts and Sciences so the arts part or

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,460
the people that put on the Oscars the

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,810
sciences part

00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,200
people they collaborate on the

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,490
technology behind moviemaking and they

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,070
saw this sort of big trends they saw

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,500
this trend that the FX is powering the

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,510
movies that are making really the most

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,760
money that the most in demand they're

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,800
also the most expensive to produce and

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,020
the challenge they saw is how do we

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,390
continue to be able to grow or these

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,890
movies out but at the same time try to

00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:19,450
rationalize our cost so we're not you

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,460
know constantly you know we're having so

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,260
much cost go into tooling that's

00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,630
oftentimes is very much thrown away or

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,010
just not collaborated between you

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,310
Studios and a lot of this is very

00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:33,040
commodity there's not a lot of specific

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:36,610
IP between things like interchange

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,930
formats between data or you know how the

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,790
you know pieces within the pipeline

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:47,470
rendering it's very common so they did a

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:49,930
survey they did a survey the open source

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,310
usage by studios and so there's a couple

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,230
interesting things here one if you look

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,160
at the top you see all these studios

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:58,600
they're using open source software right

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,150
there also some of them are using what's

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,430
called this VFX reference platform which

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,830
is think of it more as sort of a

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,870
baseline sort of versioning for various

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,560
tools not only bffs specific but also

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:13,300
things like Python and C++ and some of

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,470
like the the energy the tolling that

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,660
happens in there kind of some of its

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,030
standard programming language stuff but

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,190
what's interesting is you go down is you

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,410
see sort of the maturity curve for open

00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,080
source is not very high right so for

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,780
example actually could I wander over to

00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,740
the screen is that gonna screw up here

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:35,710
okay I'm gonna wander over the screen

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:42,310
here you know support for open source

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:49,330
software supporting it we have policies

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:52,450
with an organization of how we are

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,130
actually an owner of a project right so

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,380
you see this kind of imbalance curve

00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,090
here you see so many are using do you

00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,590
see so little contributing and when you

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,300
sort of see that the ecosystem really

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,270
has a hard time of really functioning

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:08,210
very well go to the next slide

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,490
so the Academy pulled together an

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,470
investigation committee and they got all

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,660
these studios and they are actually very

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,450
smart about this where they actually

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,310
pull together the technologists within

00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,190
these groups so think of the color

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,660
scientists the software developers but

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,380
the folks that are really behind this

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,970
technology they pulled them together and

00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,530
they really had a very open conversation

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,240
about what's the state of this like

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,310
what's the sustainability model we have

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,800
in place and how do we how do we move

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,330
forward here like how can we ensure that

00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,180
we can build something and have

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,770
something in place that can sustain this

00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,110
industry for the growth is going to

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,370
continue to have but so that the tooling

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,900
also doesn't have that same growth

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,960
problem and you're also not building all

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,210
this open source that is difficult to

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
collaborate on that studios might be the

00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,950
hoarder there's IP concerns all these

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,480
sorts of things that really brought out

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,270
and it just really wasn't the expertise

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,820
of the Academy to figure out how to do

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,290
this so they did a really really unique

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,390
thing which they've never ever done

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,130
before is they worked with Anheuser they

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,920
partnered with an organization this time

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:17,750
here the Linux Foundation to sort of

00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,850
pull this together and they and as you

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,470
can see here one of the the key things

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,360
here is they actually came together and

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,580
voted that hey need to do something here

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,560
like we didn't know exactly what we need

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,830
to do something like we know the current

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,570
state of affairs is just not gonna work

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,340
already open source they need to figure

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,390
out a way to pull it sustainable so like

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,620
I said they looked up a lot of different

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,820
organizations they looked at a lot of

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,010
different models the Academy thought

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,360
maybe we spend this ourselves

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:47,240
in the end of the day they decide to

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:50,690
partner with Linux Foundation and form

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,160
the Academy Software Foundation now like

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:57,800
I said there's two really unique things

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,780
really about this one of you know first

00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,300
of just an organization like this coming

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,830
together and all of these studios many

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,780
of them are very much in competition

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,030
with each other coming together to form

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,410
a singular foundation but the other half

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,270
is notice also the term called Academy

00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,460
Academy's never lent its name to a

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,890
third-party organization ever before

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:20,440
they are very very protective over that

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:22,810
and they decided that it's the best

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,640
thing for the industry that this thing

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,470
be called the Academy Software

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,670
Foundation so it has that blessing

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,570
because they're sort of the ones that

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,130
have the the credence and the within

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,050
this organization and within this

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,200
industry so they made a very specific

00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,910
point to call it that way so this is it

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,820
this was formed and this was about a

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,320
little over a year ago and we've brought

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,040
together at an amazing group of

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,630
organizations really across the industry

00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,000
even across the software industry so you

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,280
have you have your big studios there you

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,270
have an athlete Disney blue sky is

00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,420
actually now a part of Disney DreamWorks

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:04,180
epic is pretty good real life in their

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:07,300
Netflix because they're getting a ton

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,030
into production great and then you also

00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:15,040
have the vendor space around us

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:17,500
AWS Microsoft Intel Cisco all of these

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,600
big software organizations here autodesk

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,760
that are building software building

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,380
cloud infrastructure that's targeting

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
this industry also a place for them to

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,910
collaborate so many image works and then

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,520
you also have some of these smaller

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:34,420
shops as well I've tracked video FX side

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:36,100
effects and then even organizations like

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,700
the visual effects society which is a

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,620
non-profit in this space as well they

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,060
all came together to collaborate they

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,680
all came together do they said we know

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,680
we need to do this for the better part

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:59,170
so what's the mission why they all

00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,270
together looks like so it's formed to

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,700
help revive a neutral forum for this

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:08,050
open sewers pull together and share

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,790
resources and collaboration and it seems

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,040
always kind of funny when you say okay

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,200
we need a neutral entity to hone it but

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:18,280
it's a really really important thing and

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,900
open source because if you have one

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,420
company that owns all of the open source

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,519
there's that tension of them sort of

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,559
being the main player in the room and

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:28,479
everyone having to defer to that you

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,339
have all of these companies having equal

00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,749
States equal opportunities no one

00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:33,999
organization owning it

00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:37,149
it just makes collaboration fun like we

00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,679
see this over and over and over again

00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:40,179
industries I mean even the Apache

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,619
Software Foundation I think a lot of

00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,570
these thoughts were even pioneered of

00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,119
having all these you know developers

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,399
come together not they're you know

00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:49,929
touting their corporate hats but timing

00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:51,849
for the technologies themselves and then

00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,739
they're able to bring competitors

00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:56,619
together who are actually able to

00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:59,109
advance this technology and everyone

00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:01,239
downstream can benefit from it so it's a

00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:04,299
it's a really important thing to pull

00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:07,200
this together so what is really the

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:11,200
goals of what this group is trying to do

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,789
so their big thing is we need to get the

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,099
quality and quantity of open source in

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,899
this industry together by getting a

00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:18,779
governance model in place legal

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:21,759
community community the whole structure

00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,409
that make sure the barrier for entry for

00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,089
people to participate people to take

00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,239
advantage of this software people to use

00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:30,190
it and contributed is their right and

00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:37,749
how they're doing is you know through a

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:40,450
few different avenues so we talked about

00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:43,299
neutral forum and I think within this

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,519
it's and we've already seen this in sort

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:47,049
of the early days here being able to

00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,239
share topics being able to share

00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:50,440
resources like one of the things that

00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:53,440
we'll talk about and a little bit as

00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,169
their continuous integration piece and

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,669
best practices you know a lot of these

00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,829
projects in sewer ran very much

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:03,099
isolation they were often ran behind the

00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:05,229
firewall in these studios being able to

00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,589
collaborate in the best way to run a

00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:10,629
project software security programming

00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:12,070
prep best practices one of the simple

00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:14,289
things they a lot of these projects been

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,320
working on is moving over to see make

00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,119
for me right I mean for anybody who's

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,829
see developer you're probably staring at

00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,099
me like we put on steaming for like yawn

00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:29,799
so long live students it wasn't that

00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:30,459
important but pardon sorry yes yeah

00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,559
exactly

00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:33,759
I mean so did you do this like hey got

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,289
enough for our own case why do we care

00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,740
about anything else we've been moving

00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:39,720
over to better tooling that's in the

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,940
more people to engage better and it's

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,940
increasing the quality of software right

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,710
the continuous integration and this here

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,530
is sort of important thing because

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,270
sometimes the ability to build this

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,980
software again it's on servers that are

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,250
behind their firewall they're not able

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,140
to be able to replicate and it can be

00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,540
tricky like it's hard to build some of

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,640
these things so it was a really novel

00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,830
thing of hey let's have a common can

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,530
take CI environment that everybody can

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,420
tap into all these projects can use it

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,210
has all of the you know the best quality

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,920
tools available you know for the

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,179
projects for their ability to use and

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,280
sharing even they even that build

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,230
configurations all the scripts and all

00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,700
of that just again is your easier

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,559
probably I mean I don't know how many of

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,760
you maintain open source projects but

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,330
some things I'm probably sing they

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,740
probably maybe this but again a lot of

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,450
these things this industry just did not

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,130
have they didn't have a lot of these

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,390
practices because again they were just

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:44,760
they were writing things that their own

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:51,780
company did you use you really weren't

00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:54,059
too concerned with another is the path

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,420
for it individuals and organizations to

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,860
participate there was some of these

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,050
there's some of these projects here that

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,330
if you know if you were a DreamWorks and

00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,550
you are contributing to open V DB and

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:06,750
you let DreamWorks you might not be able

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,570
to contribute to that project anymore

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,670
because of you know the complexities of

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,400
the legal framework for participating in

00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,720
the aula valley that's a real thing it

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,440
was a real challenge for some of these

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,820
folks and it's sort of i mean i guess if

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
we look at the larger tech world but a

00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,059
lot of people shift around between

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,620
careers in the movie industry like it

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,440
happens constantly because literally

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,390
people will get hired on for a

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,800
production at the end of that production

00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,179
they have a big party they'll give each

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,770
other high fives and everyone moves onto

00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,059
the next one and they all switch to our

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,440
company so there's so much of these

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,840
people that move around in this industry

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,950
between organizations constantly and it

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,610
made it difficult to have a lot of

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:47,200
continuity the contributions

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:50,020
coming through and then can better

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,350
consistent licensing and a standard

00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,510
template and I think this is something

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,320
sort of Linux Foundation perspective we

00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:04,480
spent a ton to timeline just because

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:07,690
there was so much that this industry was

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,960
sort of really wrestling with of between

00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:14,260
IPA you know intellectual property and

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,790
open-source and we really and we're

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,919
still working through a lot of it but

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,090
it's a lot of just sort of understanding

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,250
where they're coming from and what are

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,480
their concerns but the bigger picture is

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,210
we want to make sure these people are

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,140
all driven to standard licenses OSI

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,520
licenses standard contribution policies

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,480
and things that are low barriers to

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,620
entry don't have complexity so

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,059
organization it's not just any industry

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:54,000
get outside the industry can engage

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:56,380
contribute adjust this software yes a

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,210
lot of these organizations have open

00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,360
sourced things that were proprietary

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,530
yeah I mean render me and I think yeah

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,270
render man is probably one of them

00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,500
they're not in the they're not hosted by

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,600
us but they're in the kind of a larger

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,690
realm but open queue is a good example

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,040
which was open source by Google and Sony

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,650
Pictures Imageworks which is a

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,940
proprietary product Google is involved

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,929
very relaunch so it kind of really

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,000
helped them kind of get in a good

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,230
licensing scheme but even projects I'm

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
open for a long time I'm talking about

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:25,090
opening XR is one of them it open York's

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,500
ours been around since I mean it's been

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:30,309
around since the early aughts probably

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,960
even a little than that and it's it's it

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,950
even was running through just going

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,179
through as we're going through license

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,650
acceptor to help them there is some

00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,650
interesting challenges within there

00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:53,140
oh yes we'll talk about some of the

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:59,560
contributions they're making but there

00:28:53,140 --> 00:29:02,620
they're contributing pretty heavily well

00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,020
you know I I see what a lot of people

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,450
poke out at certain organizations and

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,800
they're antagonistic attitudes and

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,270
certainly other communities I'm like you

00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,640
know it you got to start somewhere

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,250
and some of these folks you start the

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,340
level and they learn it's safe this

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,870
benefits me it's good for the community

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,430
you know I'm turning out better product

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,430
and then it sort of grows from there

00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,060
from the charitable save point I mean

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,620
they're all kind of focused within the

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,760
industry so like the visual effects

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,860
society is sort of one in there we don't

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,510
have this much universities engage but I

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,850
think that's a growing area that they're

00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,810
interested because I think sort of

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,060
talked about this one of the big

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:50,410
challenges this industry has is good

00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,110
luck realize their software development

00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,370
jobs in the movie industry and they want

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,930
to start getting partnerships a little

00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,180
bit earlier on just in the same way that

00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,740
like data science and other you know

00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:28,630
areas of technologies already build some

00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:33,850
of those partnerships you have to go

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:37,210
back to the company support them with to

00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:43,540
get permission yeah so some of these

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:46,600
companies are helping new products then

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:51,070
they have freedom to refocus you're

00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,120
exactly right it's very complicated in

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,060
that realm

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,020
and it's good to come to the companies

00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,430
that are able to make that in some of

00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:12,660
them they're just kind of stock the best

00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:12,660
they can with what they have product

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,350
yeah yeah it's the truth to true

00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,940
situation for sure

00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,890
all right so let's look at some of the

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,870
great questions all by the way it feel

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,160
free to keep stopping me I mean if you

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,620
slowed me up I'm only selling up to

00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:34,270
between this and the expo hall so you're

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:38,020
on your own at how slow and his dinner

00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:40,300
um so some of the projects were hosting

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,050
here and you can see we're kind of our

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:47,520
early days and we'll talk steps where

00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:52,390
each of these here but a couple of these

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,770
such as open there are actually a little

00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,420
bit of like the impetus of why this

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:57,040
organization was created these because

00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,780
they saw some of the sustainability

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,030
challenges that these projects had

00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,890
either they were singular most of them

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,200
were secretly developed by studios they

00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,000
were hard to contribute to there were

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,290
challenges in some of the governance

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,690
frameworks legal frameworks or

00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,430
contribution frameworks and they saw

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,260
that if we have one of these Studios

00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:18,520
sort of be the driving force of pushing

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,690
these forward it's they just couldn't

00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,640
wrap their head around like it just was

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:27,370
not something that they felt that they

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,560
could do but it was better that is the

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,570
number of stars well I'll show you a

00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,430
bigger screen here on the street from a

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,680
little bit we have this landscape of all

00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,440
of the open source in the visual effects

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,510
and animation and we actually pull some

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:47,380
of the data from it from github so that

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:52,330
shows you how many stars let's dig into

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:54,610
our first project here which is open PDB

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,740
this is actually the first project that

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,560
came in it came in probably about a

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:03,250
month after the fact

00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,680
so this is use for volumetric divide so

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,780
basically the best way I say it is

00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,660
anybody ever see is simulated explosion

00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:13,570
in the movie okay

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,310
that's thanks to open V DB that is the

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,110
open source library that does it it is a

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,640
funny thing you buy can attest for this

00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,670
every time you watch a movie anymore and

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,150
I see an explosion like in B DB I know

00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:28,630
the people who work on it and this was

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:31,800
for tree works animation and they

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:35,770
introduced this immediately from there

00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,330
what a digital Autodesk and Vidia were

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,790
also folks that came in and started

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,200
contributing to it as well and they've

00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:43,120
actually made it effects like you're

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,250
sort of the chart of the bottom here's

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:52,210
wouldn't have this you can see here

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:54,700
we'll have this all of a sudden once it

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,200
comes in the contributions start

00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,720
happening people start getting really

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,440
excited about it and like I said it was

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,060
the first project to also graduate which

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,520
to give you a sense of what we mean by

00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:10,210
there we have a lifecycle for projects

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,090
that come into tap has established that

00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,200
and it has really three stages

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,060
incubation which were new projects come

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,380
in and they kind of don't have all their

00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,490
stuff together but they're figuring it

00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,200
out so they're getting a lot of their

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,020
security policies in place they're

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,360
getting you know their contributions

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,100
policies in place they use the core

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,470
infrastructure initiatives best practice

00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,000
badge all of our projects earn that as a

00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,860
part of it something you're not familiar

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,770
with you should check it out for your

00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:38,470
project as well it's a great tool for

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,910
helping assess sort of the health when

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,370
the best practices of open source

00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:46,510
software it whooping source projects

00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:49,240
such that you're able to respond to

00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,920
security issues and things like that in

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,840
the most appropriate way the most timely

00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,910
way and it's also a good magical source

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,770
you're using to know hey is this being

00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,030
maintained in a sustainable way if I see

00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,550
that badge I know these people are

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:02,230
thinking about that which is so we

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,730
require that so all of our project all

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,880
the projects in the Academy Software

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,549
Foundation

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,900
that in order to graduate so that's open

00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:15,259
may t be so next we have the list here

00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:16,849
open color io so this is used for color

00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:19,009
graduate and color sort of transition

00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:21,670
here so you can see some of the

00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:23,960
rendering pieces within there so really

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,390
any of the movies where you see color

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,799
transforms happen in your color matching

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,390
that happens for me innovation through

00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:32,450
here this is all about through a library

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:36,859
called open color i/o this team's remote

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:38,509
Sony Pictures Imageworks this project

00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:40,190
here really was sort of interesting this

00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:42,349
gun it was sort of an internal project

00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,509
for Sony and the community sort of got

00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,579
to a point you know Sony kind of got to

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,809
a point with it we're like doesn't work

00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:49,759
we need to do it we're not going to

00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:51,200
really expand too much of it but the

00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:53,539
community itself that was starting to

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,549
use it they really said we would like to

00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:57,650
do more with it and so there was a

00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:59,509
little bit this time of war and as

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,400
opposed to going into a fork range they

00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:03,019
decided okay let's bring this into B

00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,670
Academy Software Foundation and

00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:07,339
immediately when that starts coming in

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,829
Autodesk we were talking about before

00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,970
they became a huge contributor to this

00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:13,099
and they've actually brought some of

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:16,759
their proprietary technology into this

00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:18,079
project obviously you know Sony Pictures

00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:20,839
Imageworks has been in there

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,759
Iowa Industrial Light and Magic Lucas

00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,500
Films they bought involved and movie the

00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:27,230
privacy me

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,700
and again another project here you know

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,960
if you look at the early on graphs you

00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,220
see that often with projects they're

00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,220
kind of really getting a lot of commits

00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:45,140
we're starting to see more people coming

00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,240
we're starting to see this technology

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:51,940
become in higher use and higher

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,940
contributions as well so next one

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,109
openexr this has been a project all

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:10,069
along for eons like the EXR image format

00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:12,349
has been used this actually the

00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:15,799
technology originally came here or is

00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,230
contributed from Lucasfilm and again

00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,650
they were another project they really

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,120
did

00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,500
a great technical structure and

00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,990
governance structure of how to get

00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,360
things going a lot of security issues

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,770
out there and a lot of this was you know

00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,940
there's a lot of CDs out there they

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:31,010
spend a ton of time going through

00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,540
cleaning those off seeing if they're

00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,190
even valid anymore

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,350
they had just kind of a lot of cruft in

00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,060
their repository that as we're doing

00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,890
license scans we kind of found a lot of

00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,200
linking usually licensed things that we

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,660
wanted to clean up so or make sure that

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,190
they clean up because you know if you're

00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,440
downloading something and it says it's

00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,420
under a BSD 3 clause license you really

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,520
want to make sure that what I'm getting

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,960
is all VSD 3 quads and if I'm not

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,070
getting something under it I should

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,530
understand why

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,720
so there's ants and things with that

00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:03,130
another project that is quite old was on

00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:07,280
make move to see me another project here

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,780
that you know moved over to actual

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,580
continuous integration system which they

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,890
really reven weren't using one before so

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:16,730
you know not only is nightly built

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,650
that's also static code analysis testing

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,550
analysis all those things so that as

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,830
they're building it they're getting

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:24,170
quality software out all the time in all

00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:25,400
events them out in the open and now you

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,130
have a lot of different contributors so

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,560
not only ILM and what are the digital

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,780
Facebook's participating epic games is

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,840
participating Sony's participating even

00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,610
apples in they're participating as well

00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,900
a lot of just helping get the

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,000
compatibility with some of their tools

00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:57,140
so and it got another project here you

00:38:41,000 --> 00:39:02,360
can see specs in the past all right next

00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,910
project open cue so this is acute for

00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,710
queuing queue management within a movie

00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:10,250
so you know managing kind of all the

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,500
queue stop points within there this was

00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,410
actually originally a commercial

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,870
application but Google Cloud and Sony

00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,090
Pictures Imageworks open source did the

00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,030
early part of this here and then it came

00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,700
into the academy Software Foundation a

00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,530
few months later it was actually an

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,240
interesting project because I think a

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,710
lot of the other ones the other three

00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,109
that we talked about were ones that

00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,400
were really ones that are kind of like

00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,839
the main reason the foundation was

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,260
formed as we've got a cult we've got to

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,700
find a home for these but as the type is

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,859
looking at this this is one that isn't

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,540
quite as widely adopted but could very

00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:46,359
well mean solves an important piece but

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,980
it wasn't equating Lee as widely adopted

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,080
but the whole thing they saw they saw

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,900
the huge promise of what this technology

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,849
could be and wrapping around the

00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,440
industry around it and already it's

00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:58,910
starting to kick off their Netflix has

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,940
started to engage as well

00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:03,589
they're bringing technology in there and

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,240
we're already starting to see some

00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:22,520
growth here again this one's kind of a

00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:26,060
hard one to a little bit of positive

00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:29,349
news there as well and the last one

00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:33,710
which is very new to the foundation is

00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:35,510
over the timeline this is the forehead

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,300
content here of the whole time I do

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:47,960
believe that it grows an interchange

00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:50,839
format or technology from Pixar they

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,290
arrived a few months ago and they're

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,109
pretty early on here as we head of the

00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,550
projects events at a table we're working

00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:00,740
to see that kind of date builders were

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,599
consistent but again one day

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,130
need help with governance we use some CI

00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:07,630
user structures you just go to these

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:10,789
holding things around inside here

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,789
[Music]

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:29,839
again now what if we could probably

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:30,800
notice on these foundations we talked

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,190
about the importance of gender

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,190
neutrality

00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:45,720
yeah all right next

00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:48,510
so this kind of sensors how the

00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,359
foundation sort of works here the party

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,799
wanted to tackle by comfortable we're

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,470
just freezing again all those

00:41:52,799 --> 00:42:00,390
technologists that help set a kind of a

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,440
structure for these projects to operate

00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,990
it and make sure they have the resources

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,640
that they need to get them circle might

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:10,349
fight one would say opposition house

00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,980
Magnus or the practices with one another

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:16,829
for cooperation the age of you know

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,869
these problems environment all these

00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:21,869
projects Kurtz's work on it but that

00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:29,780
also has a pretty innovative working

00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:32,190
security that and then taught their

00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,980
users tableau for technical experience

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:38,250
city with their main goal here is to

00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,859
130g the process through that phase

00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:44,549
setting the breakfast is helping to put

00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:46,920
more convenient sizes all of them hiding

00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:52,250
the heart disease it reaches platform is

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:56,039
available here and approve what that

00:42:52,250 --> 00:43:14,099
looks like here are you probably don't

00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:17,630
like that tactic now with it was just

00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:20,160
was not done like they catch terrific

00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,230
but being able to further problems with

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,539
the standards both of niches and close

00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:30,450
or anything all the software together so

00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:33,390
really to step forward for them so we

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:37,500
have some basic music witness boba all

00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:39,750
about reason CD together helping promote

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,510
and showcase the great work that's

00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,910
happened

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:46,470
and our one of our big things that we

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,420
did stick around the third repeat event

00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:57,870
is it proof identical familiar with food

00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:59,280
graph for the main event for and this

00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:00,480
surface birthday

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,390
we're not only we have two of our

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,370
projects we compete on there so you see

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,690
a bunch of other ones that run to bring

00:44:05,370 --> 00:45:27,470
these foods you want to have the best

00:44:06,690 --> 00:45:27,470
project in this industry there we go

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,099
[Music]

00:46:18,679 --> 00:47:18,809
so what they do is for that technologies

00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:21,299
economic report which is really firm a

00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:23,790
foundation 20 new industries cradle

00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:26,940
welcome to death

00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:30,270
so we certainly care about

00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,950
sustainability within our projects and

00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:34,890
one of the things that Phineas Lee's

00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:38,430
working on is to problem systems all the

00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:39,930
massive exactly is back and I talked

00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,570
about a little it briefly bit again this

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:46,050
is projects coming in projects using

00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,700
sort of the best practices the perfect

00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,610
pressure initiative add all of those

00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,130
pieces and getting them solved with a

00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:55,050
and is there a similar project they have

00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,910
a diversity initiative that's one

00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,680
organization we're ready to show that

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:03,480
they have two three different degrees

00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:08,520
and they're all getting have so far we

00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:11,460
have two that have graduated one and so

00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,620
we're looking for a few more that those

00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,420
projects through it's not just an off

00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,710
day I get takes a while but keep to the

00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,710
projects of graduating Christmas

00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:28,760
hardened we call them graduated one

00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:35,730
stage that there's a set of requirements

00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:36,090
which is actually in that they have to

00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,800
achieve

00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:41,520
so they have secured lights knitters

00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,560
homes community through cooking him so

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:47,510
like they've got toppled and again for

00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,510
the great

00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:12,329
this is an EOC support respect to

00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:14,279
initiative - breaches project so that

00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:18,169
something that they learn which

00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:20,429
addresses security it expresses

00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:24,449
sustainability also within the project

00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:30,419
for the meeting could have all the it's

00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:35,819
also very attentive meet this would go

00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:37,529
there for - that'll be a quarter that

00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:39,259
amazing when I asked feature we got

00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:43,349
interactive these projects that

00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:45,239
excellent we want to build out this year

00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:48,359
development platform for the industry

00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:54,509
and incident just so much this bi but

00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:56,729
also just as practices run a practicum

00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:57,929
uses we've our disease like I spoke with

00:49:56,729 --> 00:50:00,449
a couple of these projects that are

00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:02,819
outside that are saying hey once we put

00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:04,439
some of the carbon intensity because

00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:07,049
it's the proper foundation is put out

00:50:04,439 --> 00:50:07,949
we're using because it makes for much

00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,599
more tests

00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:11,309
it makes our lightly but II think we're

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,679
bringing hockey novel what you're doing

00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:20,639
here simply put together making our

00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:22,469
practice you know that certainly think

00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,899
about charity development popcorn you

00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,509
know it's not just evolving prodigies to

00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:30,269
come to you call the stuff out there go

00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:31,979
through the comments late go meet your

00:50:30,269 --> 00:50:33,869
project better because of all these

00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:36,179
projects are better that meets the whole

00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:45,259
industry structure and that's what

00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:49,619
really all about and then by the way and

00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:53,869
you know I we all know diversity is

00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:57,299
really bad it is just known fact it's

00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:58,919
still really bad in within motion

00:50:57,299 --> 00:51:01,469
picture now there's a lot of efforts

00:50:58,919 --> 00:51:02,939
that are coupling with that but let me

00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:05,219
get something to going to take very

00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:08,239
highly as well trying to have partners

00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:10,489
that's trying to help highlight

00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,379
people from different backgrounds

00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:16,549
getting involved in this is what they're

00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:19,309
all part of along the same time to just

00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:21,139
be awareness like there's the show hands

00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,789
before we say it about six times people

00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:30,889
realize their software development job

00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:32,239
to three-fourths of the audience that

00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:53,539
didn't know that or do you hear my

00:51:32,239 --> 00:52:03,019
question either right that's right

00:51:53,539 --> 00:52:14,599
there's Red Hat works you know Warner

00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:16,639
Brothers yeah but they don't widget

00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:19,069
these are all buried away like these are

00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,629
a lot of the same the same software

00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:32,659
that's funny doing a lot of the same

00:52:20,629 --> 00:52:37,459
offer that is yep in the back so Epic

00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:40,489
Games is participating to get a lot of a

00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:42,529
lot of the initial rusty highness was

00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:44,959
specific to the FX but it is something

00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:46,159
that is being you know as this starts to

00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:48,559
Burger this is just sort of the natural

00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,119
other angle here is you know enemy

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,299
shouldn't any of the nation not always

00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,029
enter into a ministry as well so there's

00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:59,629
a light looking to be a lot of crossover

00:52:55,029 --> 00:53:01,489
the very fear over here but how does the

00:52:59,629 --> 00:53:05,389
group is decided to refer to a tactful

00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:08,019
probably some of you know the fruit it's

00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:08,019
a great question

00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:19,799
so and you have all these mofos to meet

00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,029
some of Italy's opening you know there's

00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:23,499
obvious cooks in news both to applaud

00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:25,630
and things like that I think that's also

00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:27,579
why they make your Costas we do out

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,950
their fault at all make sure that these

00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:32,790
things running on their platform Wow a

00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:35,889
lot of the issue eating for all you know

00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,889
[Music]

00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:05,880
so all of these projects are expected

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,519
after the you know with it and this kind

00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,680
of come before we didn't see I

00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:13,499
requirements is having functional

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:22,049
testing as part of that so yes degrees

00:54:13,499 --> 00:54:23,339
there's extra those each project pretty

00:54:22,049 --> 00:54:26,309
getting their own requirements of what

00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:28,890
they considered testing for the

00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:30,689
requirements anything I will take for

00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,539
most of this software a lot of them vote

00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:36,059
for the camera this is all design is

00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:39,269
kind of particle or to rendering Fargo

00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:40,650
for a wedding ring sort of Q so all of

00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:45,709
our high abilities are differences

00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,709
within their I think it's worthy of it

00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:55,259
yeah yeah I mean that's basically how

00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:57,390
the studio's like the studios late date

00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:58,439
it's not they kind of grab all this as

00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:01,759
well now there's this thing called the

00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:04,439
VFX reference platform which is each

00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:06,539
don't think of it so much as like I get

00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:09,420
all this in a box and I go install it

00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:12,660
it's more uh here's all the common tools

00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,429
that we all use let's try to agree on

00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,859
all the versions for the facility

00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:19,319
versions to operate properly and even

00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:23,099
expands out the things like you know

00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:24,839
what bird is the hypotenuse sort of all

00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,299
those in another insulator bits that are

00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:29,699
all part of this but was the whole idea

00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:33,259
is that if I musically change the same

00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:33,259
version stay out all over together

00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:49,839
I don't know for everyone I can't see

00:55:45,789 --> 00:56:00,549
for all that these projects here they're

00:55:49,839 --> 00:56:01,869
all designed to data its find any kind

00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:11,140
of hardware water peer

00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:12,700
you mean like refer to table there's a

00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,829
lot of uh scripting a lot of these are

00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,859
these tools here a lot of these dirty

00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:21,130
plus bus tools that our major pieces of

00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:22,749
it just get each one of teachers I think

00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:26,309
probably a lot of these projects in here

00:56:22,749 --> 00:56:28,809
are mostly all C++ written and then

00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:30,430
there's - others scripting that might be

00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:32,499
some look like the employee like

00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,079
specific things these might be a little

00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:36,519
different pieces together but really a

00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:38,259
lot of these soldiers are kind of

00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,869
designed for the Bayesian interface and

00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:43,779
past different points so like for

00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:45,670
example what we call Aereo it's gonna

00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:48,609
take a lot okay how can make sure we get

00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:51,039
our formats important so they try to

00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:52,029
help build some of the bridges of things

00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,309
within there

00:56:52,029 --> 00:56:56,769
oh but you eat certain things about into

00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:59,890
the State Open final niño is thinking

00:56:56,769 --> 00:57:03,430
about okay how can we take in data

00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,779
formats from we can start our things

00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:06,730
like that because we're trying to build

00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:09,940
a tight timeline that's going to have

00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:11,499
old great so some of these uses

00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,390
automatically sort of have natural

00:57:11,499 --> 00:57:15,430
built-ins but then you know with

00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:18,460
anything sometimes that's not sufficient

00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,499
what we're trying to do so these two you

00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:26,069
scripted they build specific things like

00:57:20,499 --> 00:57:26,069
if they have specific requirements yes

00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:50,190
and player and fishing for this question

00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:56,150
to come up so it's actually an

00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:59,190
interesting thing we did a survey at

00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:03,840
SIGGRAPH where we asked like what sort

00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:07,530
of software would would the technologist

00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,180
in this room want to see that they see

00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:11,100
is lacking in the industry they would

00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,320
like to see investment be the trick

00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:21,810
project or something similar and media

00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:23,100
player with actually the first yeah but

00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,150
I'm sure there's probably said to be one

00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:29,340
so that so that's something that's that

00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:33,300
either trying to deal you know it's kind

00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:35,010
of a complex I think with a lot of the

00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,560
with a lot of this industry they're sort

00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:39,450
of starting at simple they're starting

00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,720
to get the most pragmatic level possible

00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:43,650
for them and trying to learn a lot along

00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,110
the way

00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:48,810
mostly do you know that they need and

00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:51,990
they need to be able to agree through

00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:54,870
this all is going at the same time they

00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:57,780
need sort of reconcile that difference

00:58:54,870 --> 00:59:01,770
with the challenges they might have had

00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:03,660
with like all these sort of things there

00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:06,360
that I think in the past they use very

00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:11,220
mystical aid we're totally the community

00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:12,000
like I think it's always going to be

00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,190
working progress

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,490
but I do think these duties come

00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:20,760
together and better understanding open

00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:23,250
source license in and sort of the

00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,590
difference for themselves between what

00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:28,770
is commodity software like what's

00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:31,770
commodity part industries it if this

00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:33,060
software is our industry so it's better

00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:35,640
and then it's affected one of the

00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:37,290
interesting things behind you know you

00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,970
saw some of these other studios isn't

00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:41,880
jumping on part with this software with

00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:44,820
these projects out it's really because

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:49,130
they kind of got so far they realize you

00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:51,750
know each is even better like this

00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,400
IMX fascinating uses operator their

00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:58,830
medium loopy better because of something

00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:00,330
that we build in class and I think it

00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,730
took a little bit for people who realize

01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:05,190
sort of prevent district realized it's

01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:10,110
not necessarily an IP thing of mine of

01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:12,410
how Highness that the real value is

01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,410
farther

01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:37,590
[Music]

01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:36,349
[Music]

01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:20,690
that's how that's how forward-looking

01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:53,550
the movie was thank you

01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:55,230
only out for alright alright welcome

01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,710
because people really want to go do

01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,300
their thing

01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:59,310
oh how to participate okay this is the

01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:08,610
last one great so you're interested in

01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:15,560
this open source of this github

01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:15,560
oh my yard really benefits from this

01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:43,020
thank you all love that story because it

01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:44,910
emphasizes how important it is for those

01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,550
who use community and open source

01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:50,070
software to give back so if you want to

01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:53,850
get back to Linux fest talk to us next

01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:57,450
door also if you didn't know Linux Fest

01:03:53,850 --> 01:04:00,630
has a mobile application this year check

01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:03,000
in your appropriate platform for your

01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,880
mobile phone and search for ohio annex
