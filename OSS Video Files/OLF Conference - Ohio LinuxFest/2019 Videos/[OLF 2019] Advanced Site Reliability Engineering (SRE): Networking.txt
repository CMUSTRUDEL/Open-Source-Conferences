	Speaker: Patrick Shuff
Videographer: Ernest Parke

Site Reliability Engineering is the evolution of a role for scaling websites/infrastructure that involves the intersection of various computer science disciplines: software engineering, operating systems, distributed systems, and networking. Deploying a website in 2019 is easier than every but scaling it to a nationwide/worldwide audience is difficult and debugging problems require some level of networking knowledge. This talk goes over basic networking knowledge relevant to the SRE role operating websites and gives you tools to walk away for further debugging.

Topics to be covered include:

    Overview of Linux Networking (sockets, routing table, etc)
    Overview of LAN concepts (Ethernet, ARP, link-local)
    Overview of DNS (DNS Records, Recursive resolution, etc)
    Overview of TCP/IP (IP, TCP, 3-way handshake, flags, etc)
    Overview of Internet Security (TLS, Certs, etc)
    Overview of Linux Debugging tools
