weren't your computer or something I'm

00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,450
not a patent attorney but that sounds me

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,069
a lot like using wireless data transfer

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,889
protocols to do exactly what they were

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,349
designed to do I don't know your

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,839
position on software patents in general

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,480
maybe support them maybe you don't um

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,070
I'm not a fan I'm not here to judge on

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,699
that but whatever your position on that

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,289
is patent trolls are an abuse of this

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,189
system they don't produce anything

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,070
useful

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,070
they just stifle innovation they just

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:45,239
this foundation is a 501c3 organization

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,969
they could just settle they decided not

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,010
to they decided to fight back and it is

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,860
important that we all support them

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,329
because this isn't just about the

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,989
[Music]

00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,059
foundation

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,300
if this patent troll can win against the

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,780
gnome foundation a relatively small free

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,970
and open-source software foundation that

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,280
gives a green light for this troll and

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,450
patrols like them to go after lots of

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,540
other free and open-source software

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,369
foundations and even companies so know

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,770
who is being our first line of defense

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,869
here against patent trolls that are

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,210
fighting against free software so I

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,159
would ask all of you to support know you

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,890
can support financially if you just

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,189
search on your favorite search engine

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,319
for

00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,630
well you'll see no statement on it and a

00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,729
link to their fundraising page if you

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,670
can't support financially if you can

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:40,420
just promote the message just share that

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,729
link with your friends on Twitter or

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,509
Facebook or I don't want to get to using

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,909
these days myspace just spread the word

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,859
and please support no because the no one

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,950
foundation is really fighting for all of

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,950
us

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,400
