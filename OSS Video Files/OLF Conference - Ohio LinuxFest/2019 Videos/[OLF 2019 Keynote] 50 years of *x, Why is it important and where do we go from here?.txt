This year is the 50th anniversary of many things: People on the moon, Woodstock, the Internet, Unix and our favorite kernel architect. But is is also the 25th anniversary of many other things, as well as the 20th anniversary of the Linux Professional Institute. This talk will look at many of these things and discuss the importance of each, leading up to today. In addition the talk will discuss some of the input from a BoF on Friday about what is needed for World Domination.
