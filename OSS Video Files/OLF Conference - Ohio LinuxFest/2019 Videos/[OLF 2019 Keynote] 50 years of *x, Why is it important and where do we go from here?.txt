Title: [OLF 2019 Keynote] 50 years of *x, Why is it important and where do we go from here?
Publication date: 2019-12-28
Playlist: 2019 Videos
Description: 
	Speaker: Jon “maddog” Hall
Videographer: Ernest Parke


This year is the 50th anniversary of many things: People on the moon, Woodstock, the Internet, Unix and our favorite kernel architect. But is is also the 25th anniversary of many other things, as well as the 20th anniversary of the Linux Professional Institute. This talk will look at many of these things and discuss the importance of each, leading up to today. In addition the talk will discuss some of the input from a BoF on Friday about what is needed for World Domination.

John mad Doug Hall thank you so this is

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:24,039
the last part of 2019 2019 was a very

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:28,350
special year to me because in 1969 I

00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:31,029
wrote my first program as an engineer

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,190
back in those days there were no such

00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:36,159
things as professional software

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:39,699
engineers or professional programmers if

00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:42,420
you did programming it was because you

00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:47,469
needed something for your own use and

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,989
but 1969 was a bunch of other things for

00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:54,249
the first time people stepped off of

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:57,639
this planet onto the moon and the world

00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:59,769
came to a halt it didn't make any

00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:03,039
difference whether you were in China or

00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:04,960
Russia or South Africa or any other

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,810
place in the world you were glued in

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,760
front of a television set to watch this

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,550
triumph of humankind another place

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,630
Woodstock happened and the world of

00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:22,360
music became about with bands that were

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,700
there launching at Woodstock and a whole

00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,370
series of people came together just to

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,630
have a good time in a small farm in New

00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:35,980
York City in New York City the Stonewall

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,260
Inn was a gay place for gay people to

00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,200
hang out and have a drink in good time

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,440
periodically these places were raided by

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,460
police and people were put into paddy

00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,950
wagons taken to jail embarrassed but

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:54,430
this time something happened and they

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:59,920
fought back you know and the beginning

00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:04,120
of the LGBTQ community started in New

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Jersey two people got together just to

00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,609
create this a little operating system

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,499
for themselves just for fun one man had

00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:14,230
been working on a project called multics

00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,290
that was being worked on by General

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,830
Electric

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:23,000
a TNT and a series of other companies

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,400
and he was taken off of that project

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,980
because the telephone company was

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,720
concerned that the government would

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,630
think that this was too far for the

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:38,330
monopoly because after all why would a

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:41,000
telephone company need computers but Gen

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,720
Thompson came back to New Jersey found a

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,610
cast-off pdp-7 computer started this

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,920
little project and listed a whole bunch

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:53,420
of people at Bell Labs and UNIX was

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,519
started it depended of all that the

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,310
internet was started as a project called

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,769
the ARPANET funded by DARPA as a

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,310
research project to create a network

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:06,980
that would stand up in case of disaster

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:10,040
atomic blast Wars stuff like that that

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:14,510
would reroute all the packets to be able

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,640
to maintain communications and today the

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,280
internet works mostly the way that it

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,280
was intended thanks to God and Al Gore

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,859
in Helsinki Finland little-known

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,170
little-noticed succeptible parents

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:35,569
leanest Torvalds was born we'll hear

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:38,180
more about him later you know it's it's

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:41,299
funny because I first met leanness when

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,560
he was a 21 year old college student now

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:50,209
he's 50 that makes me feel incredibly

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,040
old I already mentioned the fact that my

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:54,620
first program back then I started off

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,900
being an electrical engineer but I was

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,970
almost electrocuted by thirteen thousand

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,840
six hundred volts and eight hundred amps

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:05,180
and I decided that software programming

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,530
was a lot safer worst thing that could

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:11,299
happen was a paper cut from a card and

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,450
1969 was also the last year I ever

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,519
shaved now you'll notice a little

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,919
asterisk beside Mad Dogs beard that

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,229
indicates that there is a story that's

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,410
related to that as we go through this

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:26,570
talk you'll see more asterisks and if

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,409
there's more than just one asterisk it

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,919
means it's a longer story and maybe even

00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:36,229
better story and if you get me drunk

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,849
enough I'll even tell it to you so keep

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:40,099
track of the asterisks if you have an

00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:41,330
interest in it so I'm going to take you

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:44,479
back in time

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:48,349
the time of 1969 where computers were

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,470
physically huge okay but logically very

00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:54,110
small and very slow they might cost two

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,210
point five million dollars for a

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,449
computer system that would have all of

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:03,620
one quarter megabyte of RAM memory or it

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,870
wasn't Ram it was core memory okay this

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,320
were measured in megabytes not gigabytes

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,990
terabytes petabytes but just megabytes

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,630
in fact at one point in my career I had

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,610
to practice saying the word gigabyte to

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,000
try and figure out how big that really

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,759
was right programmers were running one

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,830
at a time you didn't have an operating

00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,729
system even on some mainframes there was

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,740
no operating system the device drivers

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,330
that controlled the devices were

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,360
actually linked into the program you

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,199
and then you would boot that program one

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,389
at a time initial program load IPL to

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,680
load that program into the computer and

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:49,919
run it and if there was an operating

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,159
system it was typically written to try

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,259
and help you the user use your computer

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:59,940
to be more efficient because after all

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:03,590
this cost 2.5 million dollars when a

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,509
billion dollars was a lot of money and

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,159
there's there's a rumor that people

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:12,539
created an urban legend if you wish that

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,789
companies created these different

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:17,550
operating systems to lock their

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,530
customers in to make sure that their

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,620
customers couldn't go to a competitor's

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,919
system now I will tell you I've been in

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,710
the computer industry for 50 years and I

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,009
never heard that conversation even one

00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,229
time our conversations were how can we

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,659
make this thing more efficient so our

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,990
customers can use this incredibly

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:43,560
expensive incredibly small logically

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,210
incredibly slow machine and if it was

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,610
the fact that we were creating these

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,590
operating systems to lock our customers

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,199
into our particular hardware our

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,569
particular system we would only need one

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,529
operating system on each one of these

00:06:54,569 --> 00:07:02,879
pieces of hardware in reality the dec

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:05,520
pdp-11 as an example had over 11

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,139
different operating systems we had an

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,789
operating system for real time an

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,529
operating system for time sharing an

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,960
operating system that did soft real time

00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,639
and time sharing we had an operating

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,650
system for education and not bring

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,500
system for health we had two different

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,740
versions of UNIX all on this one piece

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,960
of hardware and if we only wanted to

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,099
lock our customers in we would have

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,379
given you just once and use it so all

00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,669
the conversations I had and talk about

00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:37,229
you know competition between customers I

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,349
was in the board of directors for used

00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:42,990
NICs for a long time and we would have

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,000
meetings where engineers from sudden

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,260
engineers from Dec and engineers from

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,250
IBM and hewlett-packard and all the rest

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,550
together and talk about how to make Unix

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,440
better we would cooperate we share

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,640
information with each other of course

00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,110
there were certain things she wanted to

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,760
keep a little bit private because I was

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,360
gonna be the thing that you would

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,390
announce but in a lot of other cases we

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,430
would work together standards were

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,710
another place where we would work

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,140
together to create better standards and

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,820
today that's still very very important

00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:22,050
most of the software back in those days

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,610
was contributed in source code form

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,280
because there were no real professional

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,350
programmers per se if you were

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,600
interested in computers is because you

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,900
were a physicist or you were a chemist

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,710
or you were an educator and you were

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,330
writing code for your own use and after

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,720
you got that code written you'd say oh

00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,930
what am I gonna do with this right

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,840
because selling software is hard work

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:53,410
people expect you to have documentation

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,030
they expect bug fixes they expect that

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,860
you're going to change the software

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,950
somehow to make it better for them

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,020
instead of just for you and so these

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,220
people said hey I'm going to contribute

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,160
my software to one of these libraries

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,560
dicus the Digital Equipment Corporation

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,680
uses Society share the same thing for

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,580
IBM brainstorm for Novell and so forth

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,420
and so on and these libraries would put

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:25,210
out catalogs paper catalogs I remember

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,450
sending away $15 as a university student

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,480
to receive this very thick paper catalog

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,790
back in the US postal mail that I would

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,940
go through and I would see what programs

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:40,150
were available to me to run on my good

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,690
little computer systems and some of

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,850
those programs would cost $5 because

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,420
they had to be punched on the paper tape

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:52,660
and mailed to you and stuff $5 was a lot

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:56,000
of money back in those days because $5

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,700
could buy you 10 pitchers of beer

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,130
and as a college student I had this

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,530
problem you know try to get a bye text

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,070
editor a cool text editor or

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,450
ten pictures of beer and I think you can

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,550
see what direction that would normally

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,410
go but the thing was that this was not

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,240
copyrighted software you couldn't

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,490
copyright software back in those days

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,510
you could there was no software patents

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,460
you couldn't patent software and so you

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,890
were free to copy this and not only that

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,810
but you were encouraged to copy it you

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,150
encouraged by these user groups to make

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,430
copies so I would go to the school store

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,100
and I would buy some paper tape and I

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,670
would put it in my ASR 32e teletype

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,240
which copied it at the rate of five

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,830
bytes or characters a second I hesitate

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,840
to say the word byte because back in

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,210
those days we didn't have a standard for

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,580
a bite it was not eight bits

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,500
sometimes it was six bits and sometimes

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,870
it was five bits and sometimes it was

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,120
eight bits we didn't really have a

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,060
standard back in those days but it was

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,520
about that speed and I would make ten

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,080
copies of this software and I would sell

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,640
it to my roommates for a dollar apiece

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,280
and after a while I made back my $5.00

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,000
for the text editor and my ten pitchers

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,570
of beer so in reality I was the first

00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,570
Red Hat

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:29,899
so as I said in 1969 there were these

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,720
two guys Ken Thompson Dennis Ritchie at

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,249
Bell Labs in New Jersey and they decided

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,889
that they just wanted to create this

00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:39,679
little operating system for fun and they

00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,240
were gonna create a smut smaller kernel

00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,429
than typically happened because back in

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,279
those days a lot of the functionality of

00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,079
the operating system happened in what

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,420
most people would call the kernel or the

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,300
executive or whatever it was operating

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,429
at privileged mode and they said no no

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,559
let's let's make a smaller kernel and

00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:01,850
let's put a lot of this functionality

00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:07,009
out in user space and this made the

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:09,290
kernel a lot easier to make and a lot

00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:12,709
easier to get it right would ever get it

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:16,399
right men originally it was written in

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:19,610
machine language for the pdp-7 only the

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,519
pdp-7 they had was so small that it

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,199
couldn't self host its own dissembler so

00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,779
they had to go over to another computer

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,389
system with a cross assembler write the

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,149
code on that cross assembly take the

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,410
paper tape over to the PDP seven try and

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,139
get it to run and of course it would

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,459
crash in the first fifteen seconds and

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,379
then they would use the lights and

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,910
switches on the front of the PDP seven

00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:45,170
to do the debugging of the kernel

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,809
eventually he got it working on the PDP

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,779
seven but the PDP seven was so small was

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:55,069
so slow it ran out of steam so they

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:58,429
decided to move to another larger newer

00:12:55,069 --> 00:13:00,860
system called a PDP 11 also made by

00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:03,920
digital but they didn't have the money

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,290
for that and their department said hey

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,779
this is just like a research kind of fun

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,639
project we're not going to spend the two

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:14,209
hundred and fifty thousand dollars it

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:18,170
would take to buy 80 or even even more a

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:20,959
reasonable size PDP 11 so they went

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,749
around Bell Labs looking for somebody

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,720
that would fund this and eventually

00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:29,059
founds the one department inside of Bell

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,809
Labs that had to have that seemed to

00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,230
have almost unlimited money money out

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:36,290
the

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,670
wazoo now you might think oh that's the

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:44,240
engineering lab no research lab no

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:48,500
facilities lab no it was the legal

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,820
department and Jan and Dennis convinced

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,860
the legal department that they were

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,100
going to create this operating system so

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,790
lawyers could sit down and write their

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:03,050
legal briefs and format it right and

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,080
this is one reason why UNIX was so

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,750
character oriented all these character

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,910
oriented things right to go looking for

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,460
searching for Strings and things in your

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:16,600
legal briefs now I want to you've got to

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,800
get this image in your mind of a lawyer

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:26,510
sitting down to an ASR 33 teletype and

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,530
typing in using a dot editor creating

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,540
macros

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:35,300
for n ruff and tear off text for matters

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:38,840
this is why a new job was created called

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,690
legal secretary okay somebody that could

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,960
do that thing and they were pretty good

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,730
so Kenan tennis got their pdp-11 but

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,960
then all of a sudden they realized this

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,310
is completely different instruction set

00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,900
so we have to rewrite the entire

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:59,450
operating system again in assembler and

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:03,530
Dennis it's too much like work I'm going

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:05,270
to write this language called C and then

00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:09,380
we never have to rewrite to curdle again

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:12,140
and so they wrote he wrote C and then

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,680
they rewrote the entire kernel in C and

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,420
everything was fine until somebody came

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,170
along as this hey I have an inner date

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:25,760
at 8:32 could you put your nix on that

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:28,730
sure oh my god it's not quite as

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,490
portable as we thought it was and so now

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:35,300
we're going to make UNIX so that there's

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,370
apart this device-independent scheduling

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,920
task scheduling higher water memory

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,020
scheduling things like that scheduling

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,420
iOS and things and then we're going to

00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,010
have a lower part which is device

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,470
dependent cuz it has to be

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,660
it's talking to controllers is talking

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,320
to buses and things like that and so

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:58,310
UNIX started to become more and more

00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:00,410
portable across hardware and this is

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,150
something that regular computer

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,980
companies didn't think about doing

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,870
because why should they why should they

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,560
make their operating system work with

00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,780
somebody else's hardware and so back in

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,240
those days as you went from company's

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,310
hardware and system to company system

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,200
you had to learn everything all over

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:23,810
again because the computer was more

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,500
expensive and more important than the

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,930
programmer or the user and when Ken and

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,920
Dennis really did was they said you know

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:36,770
computers acclaiming faster and cheaper

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:42,410
maybe human beings are more valuable

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:44,840
than computers and at first UNIX was

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,190
distributing the source code Ken loved

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,750
going off to universities and

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,820
sabbaticals and teaching and

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,780
universities he loved working with young

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:57,200
people and this also allowed

00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,110
universities such as Carnegie Mellon you

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,780
know Columbia of Berkeley to contribute

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,790
ideas and things to this operating

00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:11,690
system but UNIX was never free it was

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,850
always licensed by AT&T Ken would fling

00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,330
his source code tapes around kind of

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,090
loose with the with the whole thing but

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,370
if you actually looked at the license if

00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:25,550
you were not a research organization

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,070
like Columbia or Berkeley or something

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:32,060
the price for UNIX was one hundred and

00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:33,680
sixty thousand dollars per CPU for the

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,190
source because that's the way it was

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,250
distributed but worse than that you had

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,460
to tell them the serial number of your

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:49,680
computer now how many of you know the

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:53,390
serial number of your laptop slackers

00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:58,170
so far yeah

00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:00,420
lazy but that wasn't the hard part give

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:05,100
me you could find that out but find a

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,710
person inside of AT&T to tell the serial

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:12,270
number did you ever try and fight call

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,030
the telephone company Joe have you ever

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,059
tried to call Google what's the

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,880
telephone number of Google there isn't

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:23,490
any

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,870
so this was very difficult this is one

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,600
of the reasons why a lot of people but

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,100
if you were one of these universities

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,760
Berkeley Columbia whatever a research

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,700
university

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,679
you got the operating system for $350

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,870
for site-wide license no matter how many

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,260
computers you had so that was a good

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:44,309
deal and everybody just started to work

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,740
on this operating system for fun now

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:48,990
there were a lot of other contributions

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,510
many many contributions that came out of

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,270
UNIX research and stuff like that the

00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,760
concept that you you separate the

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,460
command line from the kernel and the

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,030
libraries a completely separate process

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,950
command interpreter called the shell and

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,020
a whole bunch of little utilities that

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,350
all worked and did their jobs very very

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:14,700
well and then there was this concept of

00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:16,980
pipes and filters generated by a very

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,000
fine gentleman by the name of Douglas

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:23,730
McElroy Douglas was actually the the

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,800
laboratory director who hired Ken

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,309
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie into Bell

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,679
Labs a very great guy and he came up

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,450
with this idea of pipes and filters and

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,620
everybody everybody we're gonna team

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,330
said what it was so a lien that he had

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,360
to sit down and write some of the first

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:47,730
Unix commands to demonstrate how pipes

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,800
and filters would work we've had lots of

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,040
other things that have come about over

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,040
time things like the portable network

00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:00,270
file systems X Window System

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:03,120
client-server developed at MIT many more

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,660
things that came out of this operating

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,400
system

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:12,000
search in 1982 a small company out in

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,950
California with had a single-board

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,350
computer that was designed as Stanford

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,990
University this was a much cheaper

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:22,230
computer system than two workstations of

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,870
the day and they decided they wanted to

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,910
sell this and they started going around

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,070
to different companies as saying you

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,870
know can we use this operating system

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,340
and well the operating system of the day

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:38,400
was CPM you know 64-bit sorry 16-bit

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,660
address space very simple operating

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,000
system not too weak VMs they actually

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,880
came to digital in Massachusetts and

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,510
asked Ken Olson can we license your VMS

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,410
operating system and digital said no we

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,320
don't think so

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:58,620
which is probably great because VMs was

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,500
not very portable and then they got the

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,910
bright idea let's use UNIX and let's get

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,060
our UNIX from the University of

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:08,780
California Berkeley but they still had

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,360
this problem because they needed this

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:16,050
$160,000 license so they went to a and T

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,600
and T and said if we don't distribute

00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:21,690
the source code if we only distribute

00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,760
binaries can we get a cheaper license

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:29,040
and 18 C said yeah yeah we could do that

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,840
$350 per machine and you don't have to

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,690
tell us the serial number oh that's good

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,540
because we don't have serial numbers and

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,610
so they generated a to user and a

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,670
multi-user license for this and started

00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:45,570
selling these and other companies have

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,010
been kind of dabbling in UNIX started

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,650
saying well we're going to develop our

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,260
own UNIX systems I solve them shows that

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,070
the software from system v from AT&T

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,890
directly and some of them most of them

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:04,310
took it from Berkeley and one of the

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:07,080
reasons for that was the Berkeley code

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,180
the system five code was a swapping top

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,650
of operating system meaning the largest

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,470
program that you could have in memory

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:16,020
was the size of memory itself you were

00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,340
limited by the size of memory maybe a

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,490
little bit letter big

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,370
by using something known as overlays but

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,590
that was a limitation but Berkeley had

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,350
this thing called demand page virtual

00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,890
memory which meant that you could have a

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:34,140
program as big as your address space no

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:39,090
matter what your physical memory size

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:41,610
was that was nice but another thing was

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,940
the networking system five had

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,640
networking called uucp UNIX - UNIX

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:53,910
coffee and so when you want to send

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:56,970
email you had to put into your address

00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,610
every single system along the way and

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,180
that system would hop the messages from

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:05,430
system to system dialing it up sharing

00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,700
the message sharing the message close to

00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:11,550
get that storing it to the next one but

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:16,140
Berkeley had implemented tcp/ip

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:19,590
and that made a lot of difference so

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:24,180
most of the people went with Berkeley as

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:28,230
a thing now there was one person who was

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:31,740
not very happy with the concept of the

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,500
binary on these software and this person

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,800
was Richard Stallman who was at MIT as a

00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,140
student and he was in charge of some of

00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,090
these systems they had and he found out

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,250
he couldn't implement this new printer

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,100
driver because he didn't have the source

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:50,220
code for the operating system and he got

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,480
so pissed off about this that he decided

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,480
he was going to write an entire

00:23:51,480 --> 00:24:01,100
operating system in source code form and

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,690
make it freely available to people and

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,850
he did he start the project could do in

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,770
1983 he started to get people to join

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,490
with him and believed in this project

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:14,040
and in 1985 he founded the Free Software

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:18,630
Foundation to help to guide this and

00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:22,080
keep it going now he could have started

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:24,000
writing the kernel first but that would

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,040
have meant that many years later we'd be

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,210
using in 1984 kernel in 2000 you know 19

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,770
and that didn't make very much

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,630
sense there wouldn't have been any

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,120
applications to run on top of this

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,799
Colonel wouldn't been very useful so

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,470
instead he started with something that

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,429
almost every developer used a text

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,960
editor Emacs and a lot of people say he

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,850
could have stopped with Emacs because

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,370
after all it is like an entire operating

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,890
system write schedules - so memory

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:57,100
schedules tasks and everything else but

00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,289
you know he continued on and they

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,409
developed a compiler suite the good new

00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:05,590
compiler suite and people started to

00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:08,080
understand something I can use the same

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:12,100
text editor whether I'm working on VMs

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,590
or MVS or these different UNIX systems I

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,860
can use the same text editor with the

00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:21,880
same fingermarks I can actually you know

00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,760
create this text editor that I own it

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:28,870
works the way I want to and I just have

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:32,110
to copy it from place to place and the

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,270
same thing with a compiler suite that I

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,750
can write the same C code with the same

00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:40,870
syntax in the same semantics on all

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,370
these different operating systems yes I

00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,960
may have different libraries I have to

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,440
call and he even created a set of

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,279
libraries that go with that so your code

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,409
could be almost the same and this cut

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,929
down not only on the complexity of your

00:25:53,409 --> 00:26:00,039
code but also the complexity of the

00:25:55,929 --> 00:26:04,020
testing of your code and people like

00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:07,299
Boeing started to recognize this and

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,100
they started using your new compilers

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,279
even though the good new compilers were

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,909
nowhere near as efficient as some of the

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,860
commercial compilers the vaccine

00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,570
compiler for instance that ran on VMs

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,570
could produce code it was about 30

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,600
percent more efficient than the good new

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,640
compiler suite in the early days but

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Boeing said well thank you very much Dec

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:35,169
but we'll just buy a faster CPU because

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,880
the cost of us having all these

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:41,380
different compilers with different

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,899
syntax and semantics is too high and

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,220
then as a small firm called Cygnus

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:47,470
started up

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,500
and said hey we're gonna give support to

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,440
this and so there was support for free

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,530
software and Cygnus event she was bought

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,740
by Red Hat and which we know Red Hat was

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,150
bought by another company and other

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,520
things started coming up people would

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:06,700
package some of this Kanu software with

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,850
CDs and a friend of mine named Jim Joyce

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,549
had this little UNIX bookstore out in

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,500
San Francisco and when we had our used

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:16,480
expense you would go to Jim Joyce's

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,250
hotel room and he would have candles and

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,780
wine and you would go through and look

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,850
at all this great software and talk

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:26,710
about the free software that came from

00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:28,900
good new and prime know prime time

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,570
software young minds and bunches of

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,750
others would create contributions of all

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:38,740
this software O'Reilly started up

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:41,620
publishing books on UNIX and made it

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,780
more available now my own company

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,909
digital we decided we were gonna make a

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,960
UNIX system we actually had several of

00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:53,140
them a 16-bit system called ultrix 11

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,730
and then we had a 32-bit system called

00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:01,750
ultrix 32 I joined in 1983 yes I admit

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:05,559
to be very old and it was based on bsd

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:08,350
4.1 and you know it was fairly

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,750
successful not completely successful but

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:13,870
it was a fairly good system about this

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:17,140
time the UNIX wars really intensified

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,990
and Sun Microsystems got together with

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:24,070
AT&T and formed this organization called

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:26,890
USL UNIX system labs and they would not

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,299
let the other companies really join they

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,309
would say well we'll develop the

00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:32,409
technology and you guys can just port it

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:36,669
to your systems this didn't go over well

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:39,600
with dec HP IBM and some others who in

00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:42,490
1988 formed the open Software Foundation

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,350
and the open Software Foundation had a

00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:48,400
different philosophy we're going to

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:50,770
create a set of standards api's and then

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,480
we're going to test your version of your

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,710
operating system to see if there's

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,870
standard api's are followed properly and

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,850
we're also going to create a sample imp

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,950
patient of this in case there's a

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:06,490
difference between the test suite and

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,620
the standard itself the sample

00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,500
implementation will be the final Archer

00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:15,040
arbiter of how that operating system is

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,990
supposed to work we based it on CMU mock

00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,050
as a very basis of the kernel that's a

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,970
microkernel but most people never used

00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:24,160
the microkernel because we couldn't get

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:27,790
it to be efficient enough to replace a

00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,210
monolithic kernel but what happened was

00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:34,090
when you pass that test suite you then

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:39,330
had the right to call your operating

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:43,150
system UNIX a brand a thing of quality

00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:46,360
well in 1991 there was this tiny little

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,010
company called bsdi and they decided

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,280
they were gonna take the berkeley code

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:55,480
and distribute the binaries and the

00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:59,260
source code for only $1,000 and that was

00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,410
really a good deal but AT&T came along

00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,690
and they were USL ATT with USL came

00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,940
along and said oh no we still have

00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,850
copyrighted code or not and we're gonna

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:13,059
sue your butt and they started this huge

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,210
lawsuit against bsdi they did in the

00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:17,650
sued University of California Berkeley

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,620
well number one because Berkeley was not

00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,730
distributing it that way but number two

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,530
is very nasty to sue a university and

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,500
this dragged on for years and years and

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:33,130
years and was finally settled in 1994

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:37,470
when a judge found that only 17 files in

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:42,640
the BSD I distribution still had any

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,250
AT&T code in it and Berkeley said oh and

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,640
they rewrote those 17 files and now

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:52,500
there's no code and BSD Lite was

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:58,150
distributed as completely free code in

00:30:52,500 --> 00:31:01,920
1994 however in 1991 a young man at the

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:05,380
University of Calgary of Helsinki said

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:09,850
I'm gonna have this project just for fun

00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:12,700
I'm gonna write a new kernel and people

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,940
can join me and we're gonna have well

00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,860
and it wasn't to write a free kernel it

00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,400
wasn't to write a gratis kernel

00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:24,460
in fact he almost did not pick the GPL

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:28,150
as a license he didn't really care he

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:30,430
wanted to create a good kernel but he

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,740
was convinced that the GPL was the way

00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:38,170
of doing that to get the most people

00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:43,390
writing the kernel for him and so they

00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:45,520
started and by 1994 version 1.0 of the

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,920
kernel came out we'll see a little bit

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,590
more about that later

00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,890
now why could this development happen in

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:57,910
his period of 1991 to 1994 when it was

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,170
hard to do this beforehand though before

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,420
this you needed kind of like a

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,790
centralized group to develop this stuff

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,640
and this was the development across

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,580
theater that by people who never met

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,770
each other face to face well one of the

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:16,150
reasons was that powerful cheap

00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:17,920
computers had come out the 386 the Intel

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,350
yeah I know you're laughing because I

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,000
door bleed ascribed these computers as

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:28,360
these weak miserable crappy Intel

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,660
processors but the 286 was a swapping

00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,090
type of system the 286 of 186 the 80 88

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,240
and so forth was a swapping type of

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:41,380
system they did not support demand page

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:45,400
virtual memory the 386 was the first

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:47,620
computer from Intel that did and the

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,690
operating system that came with most of

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,930
these weak miserable crappy Intel

00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,710
systems was developed by this company in

00:32:52,930 --> 00:33:00,190
Redmond Washington and it was supporting

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:02,410
only a swapping system and lead us

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,480
didn't like this he wanted a system that

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,270
did support demand page virtual memory

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,110
he knew that UNIX did this but there was

00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,460
no UNIX system that he could afford and

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:16,000
would have there was open I mean there

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,360
was MINIX but he didn't like MINIX and

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,240
MINIX was still going underneath of some

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:25,180
maturation zuv proprietary stuff back in

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,220
those days so he decided he was going to

00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,690
start this new thing

00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,550
supporting demand page virtual memory

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:34,060
and the 386 although his 386 was new to

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,310
him

00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:38,560
it was old enough in the development

00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:41,200
cycle that people are now starting to

00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,930
look at 486 a--'s and they had these

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,000
three sixes that they could offload to

00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:50,260
this project that they would working on

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,330
faster internet was coming to the house

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:56,140
it wasn't just a university it wasn't

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,790
just your business it was coming into

00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:01,180
your house so you could go home at night

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:03,520
and work on this as a project there was

00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,500
a lot of information online and white

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,150
papers and things like that there was

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,490
MINIX you could look at you could look

00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:13,810
at all this stuff and get ideas of how

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:16,750
to build this kernel and the world wide

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,370
web was maturing and they found out that

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:24,399
they could use this for more than just

00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:29,080
pornography so in 1994 ten years after

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:31,659
George Orwell's 1984 version one dot L

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,000
of the Linux kernel was released now for

00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:37,899
people who not are not used to releasing

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,080
software before your software is really

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:45,870
useful to the general public you say oh

00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:48,190
it's point five we leave 0.5 0.7 0.9

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,560
0.99 zero point nine nine nine zero

00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,040
point nine nine nine nine nine Linux was

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,190
somewhere in that when in 1994 earliest

00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,460
finally said okay it's 1.0 and all these

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,890
different little vendors like soft

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,640
landing systems and ink drizzle and a

00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:08,440
fledgling red hat and a fledgling debian

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:12,390
decided to come out with distributions

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,340
using the new software MIT software

00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:19,930
Berkeley software putting it together in

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:22,630
a package and making it available and

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,990
O'Reilly who had stopped publishing

00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:29,920
books on UNIX because he had started

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,440
publishing books on Windows NT he said

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,420
UNIX is dying I'm gonna do stuff a

00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,030
Windows NT had a program windows NT how

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:40,010
to use Windows NT I don't blame Tim for

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:42,500
this because he had people working for

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:45,740
that depended on him depended on his

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,880
publishing house but when Linux came out

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:52,160
he said wow this is what I'm going to

00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,670
put my my thrust behind and so he

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,770
started publishing books on Linux a lot

00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,650
of the system vendors had given up on

00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,130
UNIX on the desktop they'd given that

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,960
over to Microsoft a long time before and

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,690
Microsoft was bringing out windows NT

00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,750
challenging them in the server space and

00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:14,089
they didn't like that and then all of a

00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:18,010
sudden this little operating system

00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:20,450
popped out of nowhere called Linux

00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:27,320
organy Linux I don't want to be

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:29,119
insulting in May of 1994 that we were

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,640
having one of these dicus events I was

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,390
working for docker user event ekeus it

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,520
was gonna be down in New Orleans now as

00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,260
you know there were to add all this new

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,680
lands in the United States one of them

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,270
is Las Vegas and the other is New

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,470
Orleans particularly the French Quarter

00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,819
you can get anything you went in the

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:53,660
French Quarter and a lot of things you

00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:57,109
don't want and I happen to love the

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,550
French Quarter and a friend of mine kept

00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:00,319
sending messages out these little

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,230
companies are saying hey we'd like to

00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:06,290
bring this guy from Europe to dicuss in

00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:09,710
the French Quarter and could you help us

00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:11,210
with the money for the trip they would

00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,040
write back and say with just a small

00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,369
company we don't have much money but be

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,079
happy to send you some CDs and I'd never

00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:20,300
heard of this person I never heard of

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,000
this thing that this guy was talking

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:26,089
about but I went to my boss and I said

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,339
you know I don't know who this guy is I

00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:33,349
don't know what he did but often times

00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:35,660
Kirk Kirk has good ideas and I think we

00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:37,190
should support this so my boss went to

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,839
their bosses has said we don't know who

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,790
this guy is we don't know what he did we

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,680
don't even know who Kirk is but Mad Dog

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:45,470
sometimes that's good ideas and I think

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,079
we should support this so we got $5,000

00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:53,190
but this guy an airline ticket and then

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:55,650
Kirk said the unthinkable to me

00:37:53,190 --> 00:38:00,569
need to have an Intel PC to run this

00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:04,560
software one and I said Kurt we make vac

00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:08,670
systems we make MIPS systems we make

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,970
alpha systems we don't make those weak

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:14,190
miserable crappy Intel pcs that's

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,470
something that the PC division of

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,130
digital makes and I don't even talk to

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:21,740
them

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:28,050
that's a toy system or you did

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:30,480
okay I'll vent you one so I flew down to

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,760
New Orleans there was Kurt trying to put

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,730
this software onto this machine at

00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,650
having a horrible time and Along Came

00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,560
this nice young man with sandy brown

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,250
hair why rim glasses wearing sandals and

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,780
wool socks has said can I help you

00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,480
Curt looks at him and smiles and says

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,680
yes I think you can and about 10 minutes

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,240
later Linux was working on that PC that

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,050
was the first time that lead us had ever

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,880
installed Linux from a CD because the

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,609
way that Lina's installed Linux was he

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,160
had a spare disk that everything except

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:06,960
the kernel on it and then he would build

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,329
the kernel and put it on a disk and then

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,520
boot that disk and that's the way he

00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:16,109
installed it he also couldn't do backups

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,790
the way he backed things up was let

00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:25,290
everybody else copy the kernel tree from

00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:28,740
him but I looked at this and I said this

00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:30,089
is really great how many of you play a

00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,650
keyboard instrument of some type

00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:37,770
particularly a piano if you tune a piano

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:40,829
you can usually typically get pretty

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:43,710
good sound out of it but if you play a

00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:46,410
really great piano like a Yamaha or

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,329
something like that the keys are all

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,490
even they're all perfectly weighted your

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:54,270
fingers just fly over it it is a

00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:55,829
beautiful thing to play now I worked at

00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,480
a lot of different UNIX systems by the

00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:05,819
point Digital ultrix Digital UNIX

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:07,080
Solaris xenix schoo UNIX whatever I sat

00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:10,950
down to that system

00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,710
it was like playing a Yamaha and it was

00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,150
just beautiful if you thought of it as

00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,890
Berkeley it was Berkeley if you thought

00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,350
of his system five of his system five

00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:21,930
and this machine was responsive and I

00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:27,060
said and I pardon you if you're offended

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:29,040
by this I said holy and so I went

00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,010
to listen to some of Lisa's talks he

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,280
gave two talks and each talk now

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:38,070
remember there's 19,000 people at this

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,860
dicus conference 19,000 digital

00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,470
customers only 40 people came to each

00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,430
one of leanness talks because nobody had

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:49,860
heard of Linux from dec and poor

00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,780
leanness he was sweating sweat was

00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,900
pouring off of his forehead pouring

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:57,900
office he was terrified of speaking in

00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,900
front of these 40 people and I went

00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:06,300
listen to it and I understood what this

00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:09,450
was and I took him out well then that

00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,210
says the last deem driven powerboat

00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,650
going up and down in Mississippi River

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,720
and we were drinking these wonderful

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,470
drinks on the bow of the boat their

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,530
drinks were called hurricanes and that's

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,970
because if you drink a couple of them

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,000
you fit lay feel like you've been hit by

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:28,860
a tropical good depression Katrina right

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,390
and we're up there we're going that

00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,100
we've had a nice dinner we're listening

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,440
the steam Calliope is stuff like that

00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:37,650
and I said Lina's have you ever thought

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,830
about pointing Linux to a 64-bit

00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:45,390
computer and a RISC processor to get the

00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:47,070
Intel isms out of the software now for

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:50,780
those of you who don't do a lot of

00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:54,600
programming what is an Intel ism it's

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,610
utilizing the hardware of the system to

00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,000
have a shortcut where as an accelerator

00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,420
and that's wonderful except it also

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,580
makes your software less portable and

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,070
ice and it says yeah I've been thinking

00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,900
about that but the deck office in

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,470
Helsinki has been having problems in

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:18,020
getting me an alpha system and so I may

00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,020
have to do the IBM Power PC instead

00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:24,749
and I dropped my hurricane and I never

00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:26,430
drop a drink ever ever ever and I said

00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:29,219
don't do anything hat don't do anything

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:31,079
rash and I went running back the digital

00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,140
the next day got to my office I called

00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,630
up a friend of mine named Jim Jackson

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,910
Jim Jackson was in charge of Alpha seed

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,709
units because we just come out with the

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,109
Alpha it was still rare some of our

00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:45,839
engineers didn't have an alpha system of

00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:48,749
their own they had to do this by being

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,420
in a lab with earphones working on the

00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:53,369
Alpha we had these seed units he was

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,920
sending out the developers to get their

00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:59,390
code pointed over to digital Unix and

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,069
also remember these systems were not

00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:05,039
$400 systems or even thousand dollar

00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:10,829
systems this was a thirty thousand

00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:13,259
dollar system and I said Jim you don't

00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:14,880
know who this guy is you don't know what

00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:17,660
he did but I need to have this system

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:22,559
sent to Helsinki Finland right away I

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:25,979
mean right away now people will tell you

00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:28,769
and amber gave a great talk today

00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:32,519
knowing about community and stuff and

00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:34,949
she said and I'll paraphrase this it's

00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:35,609
often easier to ask forgiveness than

00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:40,650
permission

00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:42,089
and so people will tell you that the way

00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,219
you get things done in a big company is

00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:46,440
you write a proposal you send that to

00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,539
your management management looks at it

00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,910
says what is the cost of everything

00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:53,339
what's the benefits passes up their line

00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:56,479
nothing ever gets done that's not how

00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:59,099
you get things done you call in favors

00:43:56,479 --> 00:44:01,680
and by that time I've been working for

00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:04,289
Linux I've been working with DK deck for

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,009
16 years and there was a lot of people

00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:10,709
who owed me favors and I started pulling

00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:12,900
them in and Jim Jackson was one of them

00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:15,329
I said Jim I need to have this unit sent

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,819
it just so happens he had one underneath

00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:20,539
his desk it had just come back and so he

00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:23,219
sent it to Helsinki Finland members

00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:26,130
$30,000 he said what are you gonna pay

00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:29,320
for I said I'll pay for the shipping

00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:32,080
and we said it and that and it was being

00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,480
sent without this very interesting thing

00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,220
called a loan of products form which was

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,440
going to say to lead his Torvalds

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,840
protect this system we want to have it

00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,240
back someday stuff like that we did we

00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,820
sent that system towards him without

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,430
that for him being filled out in June of

00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,010
that year he came to Boston to a useless

00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,860
conference I put the loan of products

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,180
for to him he was eating a hot dog with

00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,030
one hand and signing it with the other

00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,050
and saying do I ever have to send his

00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,690
system back

00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,730
I said leanness I've worked for digital

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,060
for 16 years I've never seen anybody

00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:11,440
return alona products system I think

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:14,290
you've got the system forever so I then

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,060
started looking around Dec I found out

00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:19,990
that my digital UNIX engineers have been

00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:22,570
using Linux for like six months because

00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:26,080
they didn't have a laptop with an alpha

00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:27,790
on it but they had Linux and they could

00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,560
go out and sit in their hammock

00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,170
underneath their tree in the summertime

00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,150
and program when Linux on their laptop

00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:37,090
and then bring the code in and compile

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:40,210
it for the Alpha system and I knew that

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,040
something was good to be good and I

00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,290
found some other engineers inside of

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,730
digital that were also looking at

00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,500
different operating systems and

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,640
independent of me they had selected

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:54,880
Linux as the one and then we started the

00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:57,340
port leanness actually started the port

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,470
on January the 1st 1995 it took up at to

00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,620
that time for him to figure out how to

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:05,710
structure the code for the tree he

00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:08,920
started the port January the 1st and by

00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:11,610
November of 1995 Red Hat had come out

00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,770
with an alpha Linux distribution on CD

00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:17,050
this was the fastest I had ever seen a

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,240
port of a major operating system and it

00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:24,550
was done by people who never saw each

00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:26,290
other face to face well it had the same

00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:28,300
problem that lots of other operating

00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:31,240
systems Hardware combinations did there

00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:35,550
were no applications no applications for

00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:38,260
it but remember the web had exploded and

00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,369
so there was a series of people called

00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,819
ISP

00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:44,950
Internet Service Providers that had

00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:47,769
systems accounts they had which were

00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:50,319
basically just a Solaris system with a

00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:52,390
spark Solaris system and people would

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,789
log into it and run shell scripts and

00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:58,390
compile programs to things like that and

00:46:54,789 --> 00:47:00,789
they were pretty expensive but this week

00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,039
miserable crappy Intel PC with this

00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:05,559
wonderful operating system when it could

00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,950
give you the same functionality for

00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,940
about one third of the price and almost

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,640
overnight

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:15,789
lots of people switched over

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,749
I still remember going to an isp in

00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:23,710
Colorado they just finished porting

00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:26,769
getting Solaris on all three thousand of

00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,059
their server systems and I showed up and

00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:30,249
said you know you could save a lot of

00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:32,259
money with Linux and Intel the guy said

00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:35,440
well I appreciate that but it's taking

00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:37,539
us two years to get it to all the

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,569
machines running the same version of

00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:43,180
Solaris on SPARC maybe in the future

00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:46,230
we'll think about this and as I was

00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:48,819
leaving his boss came into the room and

00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:52,539
he introduced me to his boss that was a

00:47:48,819 --> 00:47:54,220
mistake and I said well nice to meet you

00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:56,440
sir and I turned back to my friend I

00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,480
said you know what do you when you when

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:03,190
you're ready to start saving money with

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:05,619
Linux let me know and I walked out and I

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:10,200
heard his boss say behind me what do you

00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:12,910
say about saving money what what and

00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,650
Linux allowed you to repurpose old

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:18,069
machines instead of just throwing them

00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:20,739
out as useless junk you can have them do

00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:22,539
some other useful tasks and then have

00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:23,700
your new machine free to do whatever you

00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:28,599
want to do with it

00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:30,309
in 1994 Beowulf supercomputers were

00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,759
invented we'll talk more about those in

00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:35,259
a moment

00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:36,369
in 1998 the databases side base Oracle

00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:39,460
Informix

00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:41,559
all started to port to Linux and for my

00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,900
experience with other operating systems

00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,839
in the past I knew that this was the

00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:50,200
path that your Linux had been accepted

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,960
by that point that saw a company like

00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,360
Oracle would put their

00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,180
their flagship database on top of Linux

00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:04,600
in the year 2000 embedded systems sprung

00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:07,180
up and almost overnight Linux became the

00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:11,170
most used operating system in embedded

00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:13,960
system designs why because up until that

00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,300
point you had little companies invent

00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,420
their own operating systems put it on a

00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:23,020
little box use it for controlling use it

00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:25,540
for elevators stuff like that but all of

00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,760
a sudden these companies said the

00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,530
customers of these companies said we

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,100
want to talk these systems over the

00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:34,330
Internet oh my god

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:38,350
that means we have to have a tcp/ip

00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,640
stack those are hard oh my god it means

00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,850
they have to be secure

00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:45,190
oh my god oh my god they want us to use

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,680
not just Intel chips but Motorola chips

00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,330
and and ARM chips and stuff that means

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,000
new compilers that's a lot of work oh

00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:53,680
wait a minute there's one operating

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,630
system that supports all of that and

00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:00,340
it's free and so almost overnight they

00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,860
started you know they still had their

00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,760
proprietary systems but they started

00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:09,070
using Linux for a lot of new things now

00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,160
as I said in 1994 we had this little

00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:14,770
problem companies like ECL and Cray were

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,740
going out of business and we needed

00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:21,100
these companies because they produced

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:23,260
supercomputers now they were very

00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,450
expensive to design they would design

00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,360
them start to manufacture them and it

00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:30,340
would probably sell five one of them

00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,550
would be sold to the agencies that we

00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,980
dare not say their name three would be

00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,240
sold the universe sold to universities

00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,730
but the universities didn't have any

00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,200
money of pay for them and one might

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,990
actually be sold to a paying customer

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:48,900
and that just wasn't enough to sustain

00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:51,520
that business but yet we need

00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:55,320
supercomputers NASA needed

00:50:51,520 --> 00:51:01,320
supercomputers for one particularly

00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:05,890
interesting problem it's called fluid

00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:10,420
dynamics and fluid dynamics

00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:13,150
is every place fluid dynamics is in this

00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:15,490
podium you say mad dog that's not fluid

00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:19,720
that's solid but the heat going through

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:21,370
the podium is fluid glass looks like

00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,430
it's a solid but it's a supercooled

00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:26,830
fluid the air is a fluid the sea is a

00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:29,380
fluid the earth is a fluid everything is

00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:32,190
fluid and we need to solve these

00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:37,270
problems and their kin credibly

00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:39,310
intensively computing intensive so two

00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,520
people dr. Thomas Stirling and Donald

00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:43,930
Becker came up with the concept of

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,320
breaking these problems down to very

00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:50,130
small problems on commodity inexpensive

00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,050
weak miserable crappy Intel pcs or other

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:56,200
commodity computers manufactured in

00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:59,140
large quantities and then bringing the

00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:02,920
answer all together at the last moment

00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:06,940
and this is this is one at Oak Ridge

00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:09,310
National Labs 512 cast-off computers

00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,160
that already been replaced they carried

00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:13,750
them into room they put them

00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,540
sophisticated networking out the back

00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:20,230
and it created a supercomputer to

00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:24,250
actually solve and do real work today

00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:28,000
all 500 of the fastest computers in the

00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:30,150
world went Linux over the years there

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,040
were two of them that ran Microsoft

00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,890
basically because Microsoft paid them to

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,890
run Microsoft and but they kept going

00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,980
further and further and further down the

00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:45,190
list of the 500 fastest and recently

00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:48,670
they just fell off the end because it

00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:53,680
was too expensive to keep them going to

00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:56,860
be on that 500 lists also interesting

00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,400
that prize the Gordon Bell prize Gordon

00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:04,870
Bell was one of the designers of RSX the

00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,420
pdp-11 VAX and VMs he went to work for

00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:09,490
Microsoft in their supercomputing

00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,470
research department and the

00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:14,920
high-performance computing organization

00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:19,000
named a prize for performance and price

00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,490
performance after Gordon Bell Microsoft

00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,720
is

00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:25,490
to win that and I co-op Gordon everyone

00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,310
services Gordon doesn't feel to have a

00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:32,330
prize named after you but your company

00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:37,100
has never won it he says I don't care he

00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:40,040
got his money but now it's been a number

00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:44,600
of years and every year we talk about

00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,540
the UNIX or Linux desktop and we've

00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:50,030
never quite gotten there you know at

00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,890
first there was a standard and I'm sure

00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,960
you've recognized it or maybe your

00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:56,780
parents have done it where they have

00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,340
this notebook and they write down every

00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:00,770
single thing that they're supposed to

00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,900
type into the system to do it and that's

00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:05,690
because they had this one interface

00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,170
called Microsoft Windows on the desktop

00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:12,020
and you know that's the way they worked

00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:14,240
they didn't learn what those things did

00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,950
they only learned this is what I'm

00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:22,100
supposed to type to get it to do it and

00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:24,410
so another system coming along they did

00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:29,170
what alert it right it's too hard for

00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:31,970
them there's also a lack of games now

00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:35,480
one of and this is a big reason for

00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:37,480
people not using Linux I mean I I find

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,930
this hard to believe cuz I'm not a gamer

00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:43,850
now and for people to say to me I'm not

00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,380
gonna use Linux on my desktop because I

00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,800
need a game it's hard for me to

00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:52,310
understand but that's okay the issue

00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,720
with games is that Linux has about we're

00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:58,130
back in the early days 3% of the desktop

00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,230
Apple had seven percent of desktop

00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:02,780
Microsoft had 90 percent of the desktop

00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,520
and so if you're a game developer you

00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,160
want to develop your games the largest

00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:11,870
market particularly because of another

00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:15,800
factor Brazil pirates 84 percent of

00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:17,720
their software China used the pirate 96

00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,910
percent of software but the world trade

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,510
organization got them down to only 84

00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:26,840
percent Vietnam pirates 99 percent of

00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:31,720
their software that's bad enough

00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:33,050
but when you go into gaming in gaming

00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:37,040
99% of the

00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:39,140
software is pirated somebody buys one

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,870
copy of it and all their forensic let me

00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,850
copy it let me copy it let me wait

00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:46,700
that's a terrible thing and if you now

00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:49,730
bark that 1% of the people actually pay

00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:52,160
for their games and you apply that to 3%

00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,410
of the desktop that's a very small

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,650
number of games you're gonna sell for

00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:59,270
going over cross of course the gaming

00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:01,400
community does things like great game

00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:04,030
consoles which brings in more money and

00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:08,150
you can't really pirate the game console

00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:11,840
it is because of computer games that we

00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:14,800
have copyright when software back in the

00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:17,210
day where the game was put into the ROM

00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:19,700
competitors would just simply copy the

00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:22,370
ROM and create their own version of the

00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:27,080
game and that's where software copyright

00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:29,090
was first applied the other reason why

00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,690
people don't use Linux is because they

00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:34,760
say hey I only need five applications

00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:37,070
well the first application might be an

00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,770
office suite that's easy Libre Office

00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,420
another application would be you know a

00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,940
database well there's a whole bunch of

00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,730
those but then you get out there to the

00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:49,160
fifth application and that's a little

00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:51,610
harder to find but hey it exists on

00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,040
Windows so that's what I'm going to use

00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:58,610
now things have changed because of one

00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:01,430
important thing the World Wide Web and

00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:03,800
the number of browsers that came out

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,750
with different scroll bars different

00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,950
buttons pushings and stuff different

00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,900
ways of looking at it

00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:11,660
and you could no longer just write down

00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:14,050
in your notebook what the push and what

00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:16,940
the prod to get your work done you

00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:20,780
actually had to learn what these things

00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:23,660
do and it broke that interface of

00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:27,680
Microsoft Microsoft lost control of that

00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:30,350
and now we have Android on the desktop

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,140
we have Apple when the desktop and we

00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:36,020
have lots of other things

00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:39,050
speaking of Apple Apple purse another

00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:41,620
threat because it used to be the

00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:44,570
computers are used for computing and

00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,130
then you had televisions and stereo

00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,829
systems those were they can

00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:51,319
sumer items like refrigerators and stuff

00:57:48,829 --> 00:57:54,950
and the number of televisions

00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:56,509
dwarfed the number of computers well

00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,420
Apple came along and said hey we're

00:57:56,509 --> 00:58:01,220
gonna make the computer a consumer item

00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:03,019
we're gonna sell it to everybody

00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,700
everybody's going to have a computer or

00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:09,170
two computers or three computers or 50

00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:11,500
computers and that start the path and

00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:15,410
Apple said we're going to create a phone

00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:19,220
and we almost lost that but then Google

00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:20,930
came along and invented Android now if

00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,390
you ever studied the Apple marketplace

00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:27,470
you know that Apple only has one partner

00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:29,779
in computing and that's Apple if you're

00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:31,250
not Apple or maybe an application

00:58:29,779 --> 00:58:33,859
developer you're not going to make any

00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,509
money with Apple you can't sell a disk

00:58:33,859 --> 00:58:36,890
drive to Apple you have to buy an apple

00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:38,269
disk drive you can't sell a printer to

00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:40,009
Apple you have to have an apple printer

00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:45,349
or an apple scanner an Apple TV and a

00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:47,809
parabola you have Apple stores but with

00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:50,569
Android if you could even say the word

00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:53,420
Android you could put Android on your

00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:56,960
hardware and so every other phone

00:58:53,420 --> 00:59:00,440
manufacturer other than Apple said sure

00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,329
we'll support your Android and we'll

00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:04,069
give people different sizes and shapes

00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:05,690
and different thicknesses that sometimes

00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:07,660
are hard keyboards and sometimes just a

00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:13,369
soft keyboard and so forth and so on and

00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:17,180
now Android is outselling iOS at least

00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:17,710
two to one so I predict them in a few

00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,529
years

00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:25,250
Apple will still own 7% very lucrative

00:59:21,529 --> 00:59:31,130
very profitable market and Android will

00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:35,150
have the other 90% and now we have the

00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:36,859
cloud where we can hide the OS and the

00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,650
libraries behind this thing called the

00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:42,049
cloud the internet that was supposed to

00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:44,450
be distributed and supposed to survive

00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:50,140
atomic attack and all these things has

00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:54,890
once again become centralized in AWS or

00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:57,410
you know Microsoft's cloud or other

00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:59,910
people's clouds Google's cloud sure they

00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:03,440
have centers around the world but

00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:06,570
is centralized in the United States and

01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,510
people will lease cloud services to

01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:14,730
people you'll get the illusion of

01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:16,560
privacy but it's not private and we live

01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:18,540
in a very strange environment we live in

01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,270
the United States which were protected

01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:24,090
by this wonderful piece of paper called

01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:27,750
the Constitution that protects our

01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:30,570
privacy because the British Army used to

01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:35,790
charge into people's homes without any

01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:40,620
type of subpoena but if you live outside

01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:44,850
the United States you have no rights no

01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:47,280
rights at all the government doesn't

01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:50,670
even have to go to a court to listen to

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,800
your conversation that's a problem

01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:55,440
because my friends down in Brazil

01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:58,770
they're under Brazilian law and they're

01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,720
under US law because their data is

01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:05,370
stored a lot of times in the United

01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:09,330
States but we have to take back the

01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:14,340
cloud we have to make sure that the

01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:17,340
cloud works for us so the summary of

01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:20,790
history up until this point is that UNIX

01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:24,180
created portable code and portable

01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:27,720
people across Hardware boundaries it set

01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:30,390
the api's for the future most of which

01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:34,260
is in this very relatively small kernel

01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:39,360
there's 154 programming interfaces to

01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:42,960
the kernel 154 system calls to do things

01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,870
for you there's over 10,000 library

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,720
calls which is where the real

01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:51,360
functionality happens

01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:55,440
Kanoe Linux rewrote this we ignited this

01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,820
and gave back a lot of the control of

01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,640
the hardware to you

01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:03,810
not completely there's still a lot of

01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:06,390
binary blobs out there in firmware for

01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:11,070
devices that could hold malware in them

01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:13,019
the BIOS is a freaking mess and holds

01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:17,849
all sorts of really

01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:20,969
horrible stuff we need to fix that we

01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:22,619
need to spread the concept of free and

01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:26,609
open source software and hardware and

01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:29,130
culture we need to be able to teach

01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:30,929
people how to use Creative Commons what

01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:34,529
the goodness is of it business plans

01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:37,319
around that when I first started working

01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:40,949
with Linux my manager is a Dec

01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:43,259
questioned my sanity how in God's name

01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:45,539
can you sell an operating system and

01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:48,869
make money a free operating system and

01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:57,269
make money and they laughed at me and

01:02:48,869 --> 01:02:59,399
now all of them work for IBM so I was

01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:02,880
asked besides the history of this to

01:02:59,399 --> 01:03:06,149
talk about the future we are in a

01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,489
wonderful place right now but we have a

01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:12,479
lot of users out there that know nothing

01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:14,039
about software freedom they use their

01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:16,079
Android phone they punch in their

01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:19,559
applications and stuff like that they

01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:24,269
don't know or care about freedom and we

01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:27,079
have to educate them some companies have

01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:32,189
been told love open-source

01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:33,449
I've dealt with them for a long time you

01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:36,599
notice that they don't say that they

01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:37,489
love Linux they love open-source what's

01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:40,289
the difference

01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:42,059
open-source protects the developer

01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:44,279
open-source gives rights to the

01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:47,339
developer to the company using the code

01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:51,119
that other people have written free

01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:54,089
software gives that support to the end

01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:57,299
user gives the protection to the end

01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:59,249
user I have a drawer full of little

01:03:57,299 --> 01:04:01,259
computers that I can no longer use

01:03:59,249 --> 01:04:04,289
because a company that made them going

01:04:01,259 --> 01:04:08,579
out of business and they use firmware

01:04:04,289 --> 01:04:11,279
that I can't replace let's talk about

01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:13,219
love for just a second in the ancient

01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:17,189
Greek there was three types of love

01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:20,959
there was a gob a the love of God for

01:04:17,189 --> 01:04:24,869
humans the love of mother for children

01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:26,450
but even the love of mothers is not

01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:29,430
without a cost

01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:32,040
if you love me you'll take out the

01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:37,040
garbage if you love me you'll feed the

01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:39,330
dog but your mother will still love you

01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,630
agape the greatest love

01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:45,380
then there's fellows from which we get

01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:48,360
for lots philosophy philosophy

01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:52,050
philanthropy Philadelphia the City of

01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:56,790
Brotherly Love filos is a love of

01:04:52,050 --> 01:05:02,580
friends for one another but then we have

01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:05,580
eros the deepest dirtiest love the

01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:12,090
sexual love from which we get the word

01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:16,380
erotica saw these companies love free

01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:21,590
software or the eros level don't bend

01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:25,280
over in the shower and wear your condoms

01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:27,990
we are close to word world domination

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,450
500 fastest computers in the world run

01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:33,180
Linux most used in embedded system

01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:35,700
design 60% of the world's servers are

01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:41,700
being shipped with Linux the desktop is

01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:47,520
actually now 10% install base 10% Linux

01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:49,140
and it's selling through androids and

01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,010
Chromebooks of things like that at a

01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:56,160
much higher rate we are close but you

01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:58,290
have to keep fighting you have to make

01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,360
people understand the business models

01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:02,490
around free software that you can make

01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:05,220
money with free software and that the

01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:08,490
goodness of software for the public use

01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:11,280
if you pay for software in your taxes

01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:13,350
through the government or through

01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,510
education you should have the right to

01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:19,920
use that software without having to pay

01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:21,840
for it again you need to talk about free

01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,530
and open source all the time

01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:28,460
be a pain about it make it so that

01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:31,160
people run away from you when you come

01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:33,980
because you're the frontline you're the

01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:37,550
frontline right you have to talk to your

01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,920
politicians your educators K through 12

01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:43,820
there's plenty of software out there to

01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,980
teach kids K through 12 university we

01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,810
should have note there's no reason why

01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,920
university students particularly in

01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,960
computer science and computer

01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:56,810
engineering should not be using open

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:59,900
source no reason maybe 25 years ago

01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:02,150
there was a reason because when you went

01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:04,490
out to SourceForge you find out that

01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:07,580
there was 13 thousand applications out

01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:10,640
there and 1.3 million people adding to

01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:15,109
it but now when you go to github there's

01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:17,960
400 30,000 applications and 26 million

01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:19,550
people contributing to it and it's

01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,490
almost an application for almost

01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:24,650
anything you can do and you don't have

01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:26,720
to use all of the application if you use

01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:32,660
a portion of it as long as you obey the

01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:37,609
license industry bring pocket products

01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:39,589
to market faster cheaper why should you

01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:41,599
be paying for something when you can get

01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:45,109
all the functionality you need for free

01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:49,910
and if you need to make changes to it

01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:54,680
you can hire a local programmer to do

01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:58,760
the work I tell people the United States

01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,180
is actually 50 small countries I live in

01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,849
the small country of New Hampshire we

01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:08,540
only make 2 things in New Hampshire

01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:10,490
maple syrup and software and I'm tired

01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,839
of sending all my money for software

01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,820
there's a small country of Redmond

01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,069
Washington or Silicon Valley I came

01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:18,500
quite frankly tired of that especially

01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:21,980
when I have software programmers out of

01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:24,469
work and so I say let's keep the work

01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,540
here because those programmers will then

01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:30,469
buy local food local housing and pay

01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:37,759
local taxes we should all be thinking

01:08:30,469 --> 01:08:40,000
like that and next year I want you to

01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:44,210
bring two windows programmers

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,920
Judy Ohio Linux fest how many of you

01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:50,540
have ever heard the story of the

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:52,640
invention of the checkerboard a king in

01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,590
China went to do game and a

01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,570
mathematician said I live eighteen new

01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,890
game five vent a new game for you it's

01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:00,110
going to be a board with these little

01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:02,120
squares on it but what I want and he

01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:03,470
invented the board and the King was so

01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,010
impressed with it he said how can I

01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:06,170
repay you

01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,670
he said I went to grains a wooden beam

01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,440
of rice on the first square two in the

01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,900
second four in the third and so forth

01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,670
and so on the King said yes your wish is

01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:16,520
granted

01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:18,950
the King was not a mathematician because

01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:22,100
by the time he got that 1/64 square

01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:25,850
there was enough rice in China to pay

01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:28,280
for it so if we do the same thing you

01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:30,410
people bring two windows users to ofl

01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:32,240
next year and then they bring two

01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:35,150
windows uses to owe off the year after

01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:39,430
that and they bring two in ten more

01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:39,430
years we will have world domination

01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:43,370
these are some of the projects I'm

01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:46,310
working on and linux professional

01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:48,680
institute is ongoing we're forming we're

01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:50,840
going to form a membership become a

01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,810
membership organization so that you

01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:55,820
people will be able to determine the

01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:58,970
debt the direction that we're going in

01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:02,510
the future I write and blog for various

01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:05,540
magazines caninus Lucas is a project I

01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:08,060
have done in Brazil because the

01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:11,570
Raspberry Pi due to customs duties costs

01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:13,000
about 120 dollars done in Brazil so

01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:16,820
we're designing and manufacturing

01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,310
computers down there people told me it's

01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:22,000
impossible and will never happen I've

01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,000
heard that before

01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,990
this is another little computer that we

01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:32,660
designed in our manufacturing in Brazil

01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:35,150
uses an arm m4 processor is 256

01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:39,410
kilobytes of RAM 512 kilobytes of flash

01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:42,200
and it runs Linux it has little sensors

01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:43,850
around the outside it runs off of a

01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,610
watch battery for about six months

01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,740
getting the batteries it's a year have

01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:52,989
an uber capacitor in a solar panel its

01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:55,269
indefinite uses Bluetooth mesh or lower

01:10:52,989 --> 01:10:58,630
and to communicate Laura ran will

01:10:55,269 --> 01:11:02,260
transmit up to 10 kilometers not very

01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:04,329
fast but that's okay I have another

01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:07,900
project project cauã which helps

01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:11,789
University students afford University we

01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:15,639
talk a lot about students these days and

01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:18,969
their horrible charges that they have

01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:20,949
from the university courses in Latin

01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:23,920
America most of the universities are

01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:27,639
free of tuition federal state

01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:30,460
universities are free of tuition but 40%

01:11:27,639 --> 01:11:32,260
of the students who qualify to go still

01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:34,539
cannot afford it because their families

01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:36,519
are too poor to afford to how the

01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:38,530
apartment the transportation the

01:11:36,519 --> 01:11:41,170
computers the internet and so forth

01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:42,730
so project cauã teaches these students

01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:44,860
how to use the technical skills they

01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:48,849
already have to set up their own

01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:51,309
business we create a contractor skeleton

01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:54,849
contract for them skeleton advertising

01:11:51,309 --> 01:11:57,849
materials we teach them how to sell we

01:11:54,849 --> 01:12:01,559
approach businesses and what we do is we

01:11:57,849 --> 01:12:04,059
align the students with six businesses

01:12:01,559 --> 01:12:08,619
and the students give them four hours a

01:12:04,059 --> 01:12:11,170
week every week to do things on their

01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:13,659
systems look at the error logs see if

01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:17,170
the disk is about to fill up make sure

01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:20,130
their Wi-Fi is secure apply patches to

01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:23,889
find new software for them to use and

01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:26,249
those by working 24 hours a week these

01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:30,699
students will be able to afford

01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:33,639
University and then finally there's my

01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:34,539
retirement project plus BS which I'll

01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:37,210
