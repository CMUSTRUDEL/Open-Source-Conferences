Videographer: Ernest Parke

In this presentation I will introduce the practice of Infrastructure as Code. I will present to the audience what IaC is, why it’s needed and then proceed to showing how you can practice IaC using Hashicorp’s Terraform. I will walk the audience through the Terraform language (variables, data structures, iterations, conditionals) and how to use Terraform to begin building infrastructure in AWS. The presentation will end with a short demo of Terraform.
