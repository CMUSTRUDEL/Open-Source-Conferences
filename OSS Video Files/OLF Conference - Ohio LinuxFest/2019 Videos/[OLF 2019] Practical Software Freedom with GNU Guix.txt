Software freedom gives us the ability to run, study, modify, and distribute software as we wish. Unfortunately, there are many practical obstacles that discourage us from making use of these freedoms. GNU Guix, a functional package manager and GNU/Linux distribution, removes many of these obstacles. Guix makes it easy to take advantage of these freedoms by making the everyday package management tools the same ones that are used for development, presenting a Guile Scheme API to all aspects of the system, allowing users to easily extend the system, and much more. We will tour Guix with an eye as to how its unique features can enhance your software freedom.
