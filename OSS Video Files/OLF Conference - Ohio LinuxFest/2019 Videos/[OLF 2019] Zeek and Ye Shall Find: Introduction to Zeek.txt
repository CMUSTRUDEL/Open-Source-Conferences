Zeek is the widely used open source network security monitoring project (formerly known as Bro) used by the worldâ€™s most advanced, most attacked mission-critical networks. Zeek was created in 1995 by professor Vern Paxson at UC Berkeley. Today the project is hosted by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley. Zeek is incorporated into dozens of commercial products and is a core part of the curriculum for courses in digital forensics, threat hunting and incident response taught by organizations like SANS.
