Zeek is the widely used open source network security monitoring project (formerly known as Bro) used by the worldâ€™s most advanced, most attacked mission-critical networks. Zeek was created in 1995 by professor Vern Paxson at UC Berkeley. Today the project is hosted by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in Berkeley. Zeek is incorporated into dozens of commercial products and is a core part of the curriculum for courses in digital forensics, threat hunting and incident response taught by organizations like SANS.

it's nice to be back here - hi Ola

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,330
next-best it's been a year or so since

00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,730
I've been here so it's always a good

00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,519
time when I come back and this this

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:17,060
particular conference holds a special

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,039
place because this year all three of my

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,380
very first people who encouraged me to

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,029
get in to stay involved in open source

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:29,119
two of which are keynoting Rikki Inslee

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,929
and John mad dog Hall along with Beth

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,390
Lynn

00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:35,180
most of you know her they were the three

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,489
that probably my very first Linux event

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,670
encouraged me to stay involved and here

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:42,710
we are ten years later almost and and

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,899
I'm still going so it's it's a good

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,359
event to be at and if you're wondering

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,519
why you're doing this or why you got

00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,140
involved in the first place or even how

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,269
you stay involved and stay motivated

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,749
this is probably one of the better

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:58,760
conferences to be yet to find that if

00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:00,589
you haven't already so what I want to

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,719
talk about today is an introduction to

00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:04,309
Zeke I bet none of you have heard of

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,460
Zeke how many of you have heard of Zeke

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,590
out there have even heard of bro all

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,720
right bro is now Zeke obviously we

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,940
changed the name for a whole host of

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,560
reasons but for those of you who don't

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,340
know the history of that or wondering

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,010
why would you ever have a project called

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,040
bro it goes back to 1984 and George

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,930
Orwell and big brother and you know

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,510
keeping in mind as you write these

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,280
different types of tools for security

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,470
purposes they could be used for either

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,630
good or bad so we always wanted to keep

00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,290
in mind that these tools could be used

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,450
either way so what is he seeks an

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,060
open-source network security monitoring

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,350
framework it says if he was here he's

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,760
one of the cofounders and one of the

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,650
core maintainer and he's supposed to be

00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,040
on his way over he would tell you that

00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,200
it's a language that works as a tool I

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,920
say it's a tool it was originally named

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,810
bro Verne Paxson created this in 1995 at

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Berkeley so it's been around for a long

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,020
time and it's used by the US government

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,289
along with many other agencies a lot of

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,930
universities BYU is one that uses it and

00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:14,970
several others used in most socks

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,799
incident responses threat hunting

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,049
Network forensics all of those type of

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,110
things that functionality has been

00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,510
integrated into Zeke and Zeke is also

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,489
BSD license so they throw it over the

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,110
fence whatever you want to do with it

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,849
you can do with it

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,030
the corporate sponsored core like who

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:37,079
pays my check I they employ me but I

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,370
work for the Zeke community they you

00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:40,620
know they even compete with some

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,709
organizations that build their security

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,730
stack on top of Zeke as well so there's

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,819
many things like ricotta or rockin MS or

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,030
others that or security onion I'll have

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:57,180
you know Zeke in their framework so at

00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,019
times we compete with ourselves or core

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,389
like competes with others using Zeke but

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,099
what is it like everybody some people

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:12,260
ask is it is it an IDs no is it a

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:15,150
particular tool like is it a is it a

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,180
solution it is a tool in a set of

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,530
solutions so it's data without judgment

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,900
we don't tell you what the data is we

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,540
just make it available to you the logs

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,940
are very rich and deep it's got a wide

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,329
breadth there's probably 30 different

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,510
log types right now and we just make

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:36,989
sure that you can see in depth to your

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,060
network now you'll notice that on these

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,650
logs you see the real pretty ones those

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,660
are the ones that the corporate sponsor

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,639
does the other ones that can be found in

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,069
our Zeke documentation they're the ones

00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,049
that the community does so you can see

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,730
the look one has a developer feel and

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,769
one has that marketing feel but they're

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,409
all the same logs and Zeke gives you

00:03:52,769 --> 00:04:00,329
those logs and insight into your network

00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:02,010
but it's more than just a tool that you

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:05,370
get out of the box that you can't

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,139
customize so many of the tools that we

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,510
have in there in the tool sets today

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,090
where we net where you monitor your

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,560
network aren't easily customizable now

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:18,359
Zeke is customizable as the as the

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,729
landscape changes the community has the

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,979
opportunity on ice a community and when

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,260
I say that I mean anybody who's out

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,060
there writing scripts to extend the

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,670
capabilities of Zeke

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,350
you have the ability

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,420
to do that yourself and so you can do

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,970
that by going to packages I think that

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,720
Oregon scene though we were up to 113

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:42,200
now so I think we've added probably

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,940
about 25 in the last nine months so

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,550
we're up to those packages you might

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,440
have heard of The MITRE bizarre

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,630
framework that was released they

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,700
released that a couple months ago it's

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,580
in the package maintainer Amazon just

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,680
released five new protocol analyzers

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,930
that are in the package manager as well

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,030
so the community is always extending

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:09,470
this capability and you have the ability

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:11,870
to do that as well so many people here

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,670
are familiar with you know the red hat

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,860
fedora relationship you're familiar with

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,040
the canonical bunty relationship and

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,920
those type of relationships so the Zeke

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,670
and correlate relationship is that Vern

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,290
Paxson Seth Hall and Robin summer all

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,880
started what was originally called bro

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,590
Walla and when they changed the name

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,400
they had to have it a new name it's now

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,840
called core light and what it is and I

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,020
know there's some controversy around the

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,550
term open core but it they we build

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,040
ourselves as an open court company

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,530
whereas the open source piece of it is a

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,500
development model and the business model

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,770
is the open core piece of it and so

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,650
because the three of them founded the

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,260
organization core light is committed to

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,360
not only funding the project but

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,490
supporting improving extending and

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,480
making sure that the open source project

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,610
stays healthy and is vibrant for anyone

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,310
who wants to use that particular project

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,880
in their security stack so those who are

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,770
worried that core light may be taking

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,150
over the project or anything like that

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,190
it's not the case it's still a

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,120
community-based project it's only being

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,070
funded by core life and all the core

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,100
maintainer and developers right now are

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,750
employed by core light now as the

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,550
community director and someone they

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,950
brought on board back in February my

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,810
goal is to find more maintainer x' and

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,840
more developers and I want to get into

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,840
how we define those later on in the talk

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,669
so this is the piece I was hoping that

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:48,770
Seth was gonna be be here for but I'm

00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,319
I'm not gonna dive as deeply into it as

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,449
he would but I am gonna give you a

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,520
little bit more information about what

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,110
Zeke is so we're gonna look into it a

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,000
little bit more and tell you kind of how

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,150
you could up your network defense game

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,340
with it so defending your network takes

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,250
several data sources as most of you know

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,509
you know there's the network traffic

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,479
piece of it

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,639
there's the Intel the logs the the host

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,680
data like all that takes the route you

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,020
have to have several sources to really

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,210
look into what's coming across your

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,370
network everything has to traverse your

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,190
network and it it's not just focusing on

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,169
like host based monitoring and detection

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,610
but it's also like any device that

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,580
connects those Internet of Things

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,529
devices that connect to your network or

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,629
when your employees you know bring your

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:37,279
own device right you're you're setting

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,169
up your own programs and their phones

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,960
are connected you need to know what

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:45,319
what's happening on your network so a

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,289
lot of times you know we need

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:50,029
complementary tools and these you know

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,009
the network for the breadth the endpoint

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:54,229
for the depth the Intel for your

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:57,169
external piece of it and then your logs

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,509
for your operational detection so how

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:04,729
does Zeke help you monitor all of this

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:06,529
and keep you know make sense of it so I

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,020
bet most of you are very familiar with

00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,389
peak apps you know that provides you

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,870
know that high fidelity insight to your

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:17,120
network you know but those of you

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,310
familiar with peak apps know that it

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,129
takes a lot of space and you can't keep

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,830
a lot of data around for a long time

00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:27,889
even well-funded enterprises only keep

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,259
those for a few weeks maybe a month

00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:33,110
before they need to flush all that data

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,360
because it's so big it gives you high it

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,870
gives you great insight but the data is

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,360
not compressed and it's it's very wide

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,130
and your intrusion detection is you know

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,199
they're they're prevalent and they're

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,570
valuable tool for identifying a lot of

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:49,610
different malicious traffic but it's

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,720
driven by signatures and subscriptions

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,620
and how you setup those and then you

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,500
know you have

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,360
to have your customization for that and

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,560
you're limited on what signatures are

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,260
provided by that system now NetFlow it's

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,970
going to give you like it's probably the

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,290
most commonly deployed tool but I'm

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,810
probably not telling you anything that

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,110
you don't already know but it's going to

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,750
give you you know your ear it's like

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,170
your phone bill it's gonna tell you like

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,250
how long the call was when it happened

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,300
but that's about it you know it's gonna

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,140
tell you the length of the call but

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,790
you're not going to know what was

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,330
discussed you're not gonna know what

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,010
happened during that call you might get

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,779
you know your IP addresses and your

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,430
ports and that sort of stuff but you

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,810
know it doesn't give you the insight as

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,940
to what was transferred across your

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,730
network so sometimes you need something

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:45,920
that gives you that high look that

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,779
fidelity look like a pcap it also you

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,270
know you want that resilience or

00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,980
reliance like the information that you

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,620
get from an IDs but you don't always

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,180
want to rely on signatures and you want

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,120
to have the ability to store that data

00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,880
for months or years if you need to and

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,860
so we're those gaps where we see those

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,520
gaps and pcap and we see the gaps and

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,010
IDS's

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,050
and with net flow there's a reason you

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,380
have you combine all of those well those

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,660
gaps that you see in those tools zeke

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,730
fills in the gaps for those and again

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,160
it's all open source you can go to zq

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,520
oregon download it you know right now if

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,970
you wanted to so how is how is the

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,529
different it's not an IDs it's not a

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,750
packet capture tool and it's not a

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:31,970
network analyzer it's it's it's

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,730
different from all of those things and

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:38,240
and for a long time people thought all Z

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,279
Kazan IDs well it's really not it

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,940
performs and gives you real-time

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,490
analysis of dozens of protocols and like

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,410
I said Amazon just released five new

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:55,160
protocol analyzers so the community is

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:57,320
always upping what Zeke can do so not

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,070
only does it give you the real-time

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,329
analysis of common protocols like HTTP

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:07,040
DNS SSL they're also logged alongside of

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,470
like your IRC

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,620
your MySQL and others like that so Zeke

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,579
works in concert with your your IDs

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,980
stuff

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,720
your host logs and your sim so while we

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,759
give you this data on the open source

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,740
side you have all these logs you got to

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,139
do something with them some people like

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,630
to grip the logs and look at them it's

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,089
very painful and time consuming tedious

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,920
and often frustrating so you have to

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,100
have a sim so a lot of people use Splunk

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,449
a lot of people use elastic or humo or

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,940
others to analyze this data we just make

00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:42,889
it easy for you to get that data and

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,949
then put it into your sim of choice and

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,560
so we're we're host based monitoring has

00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:50,990
those you know blind spots Zeke's gonna

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,209
give you your peripheral kind of like on

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,069
your rear-view mirror when it says

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,769
objects may be closer than they appear

00:11:55,069 --> 00:12:00,740
and they give you a wider area so Zeke

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:02,660
is going to give you the data to figure

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:08,240
out what's happening where the others

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:10,339
fall Shores and remember like this data

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,959
is without judgement Zeke's not going to

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,880
tell you if it's right or if it's wrong

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:18,019
it's just going to give you that that

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,569
data and it doesn't rely on

00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:23,300
subscriptions or signatures and it and

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:28,190
it continuous it's a continual analysis

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,959
of all of a variety of logs and so you

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,019
get to decide what you want to focus on

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,139
based on how you have your alerts and

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:43,550
and setup and your network and your

00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:45,680
network stack so you can see that it is

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,389
a different tool and hopefully you're

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,240
starting to see that it does fill in

00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:52,010
those gaps where others fall short and

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
I'm not saying anything bad about any of

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:55,579
the others I mean I don't really care

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,350
where you get your Zeke from I don't

00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,420
care if you get it from the Zeke website

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,380
if you get it from security onion if you

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:05,870
get it from ricotta like wherever just

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,980
go try it out and then there's lots of

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:11,300
other enterprise level support that you

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,829
can get out there I'm not going to say

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,170
just correlate because there is others

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,450
out there I might be partial to

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,230
correlate but

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,540
saying that you have to do that at all

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,480
so how does you know Zeke you know

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:27,640
monitors the network traffic doesn't

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,800
matter how you get your traffic in there

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,020
whether it's through a network tap

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,030
whether it's through the spam port or a

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,400
packet broker it doesn't matter

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:39,490
Zeke's just going to turn your network

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,680
traffic into useable logs and it's a way

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,860
to like you know parse out the normal

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,830
traffic flag abnormal traffic export the

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,350
data from the the Zeke logs parse them

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,870
into different text files and then be

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:58,090
able to read them like I said in the sim

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,950
of your choice so your some of those

00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,840
logs that that I was telling you about

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,760
the cool thing about the Zeke logs is

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,470
they're pivotable so they'll have a

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:12,880
unique ID so let's say you were looking

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:15,550
at the con log and you saw maybe you saw

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,920
something there that made you come hmm

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,930
let me let me look at it so you're

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:26,470
looking through there and you see where

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:28,360
maybe there was a an HTTP IP address or

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,610
you can any of those type of things we

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,310
once you see that unique ID you could

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,600
see if is it in your HDTV log if it's in

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,820
there and it's leading you to the other

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,890
logs you'll be able to pivot between the

00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,630
logs and figure out what somebody was

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,210
doing on your network so it's not like

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,280
every log has a unique ID or every IP

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,280
address on every log as unique it's a

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:53,620
pivotable unique ID that follows it

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,210
across all log types I'm using cards up

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,910
here because I tend to talk very fast

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,340
and by having just to flip the cards I'm

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,000
slowing down so if I do talk too fast

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:05,680
let me know so you can also see here

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,560
that there's a lot of different ways

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,110
that people use Zeke and these are just

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,340
just a tip of the iceberg what people

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,440
are doing with it and how the detection

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,730
capabilities that Zeke gives you know

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,830
Zeke's not going to tell you that until

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,020
you analyze it but the information is

00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:26,170
going to be there so a lot of times you

00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,760
get that information and maybe something

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,589
happens but if you're using the Zeke

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,959
logs you could

00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,089
and you you you keep them you could go

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,189
back and figure out what happened even

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,050
before like a zero-day event happen

00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:39,579
before twitter blows up and says this

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,790
thing happens if you're looking at your

00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:47,079
traffic you're gonna be able to see that

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:50,499
early on I don't really want to get into

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:52,990
these use cases only because I'm not the

00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:54,670
experts all the detail of this was Seth

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,410
was I was hoping he was gonna be here to

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,129
go through this piece but I guess he got

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:01,720
held up but you but I'm not gonna go

00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,790
through all the details but basically

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,949
what all of these use cases are saying

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,569
is that whether your incident responding

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:09,699
and you're looking at something that

00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:12,459
showed up in your DNS log those

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:15,189
pivotable you IDs can lead you to all

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:18,759
the other logs to find out what happened

00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:20,529
so where you might you might have an

00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,389
incident response where you're you're in

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:26,019
your sock and you get this alert and

00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:28,269
then do you do you call your team in at

00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:31,509
2:00 a.m. or do you really take a deep

00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:36,120
look at the logs first before you spin

00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:38,559
up a whole alarm system across your your

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,559
organization so Zeke will give you the

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,959
opportunity to dig deep first before you

00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,329
you know send out that response to your

00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,790
team so maybe a deeper look than what

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,559
you would have had without it you would

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,540
have spun your whole incident response

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,730
team up and got everybody worked up at 2

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,800
a.m. when if maybe you could have taken

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,470
just a little bit deeper look into all

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,149
the logs you would have found out it

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,410
might have been something that caused

00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,720
that but it could have been something

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,959
you know minor that wouldn't have caused

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,360
everybody to come in at 2:00 a.m. the

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,699
other use case that we have that Zeke

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,620
was proven to be helpful in is threat

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:18,250
hunting so incident responders and

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,990
threat hunters alike use Musique so I

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,850
don't know how many of you all are in

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,329
the side of the house how many of you

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:28,000
all are incident responders anybody or

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,890
threat hunters or maybe your system

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,169
administrators and you have to like deal

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,960
with this kind of stuff yeah so and I

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,539
think a lot of times the corporate side

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,059
of things especially like on the

00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:42,730
enterprise folks that that deploy Zeke

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:46,270
in their solution oftentimes

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,460
look at you know they they focus on the

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,169
CISOs and the threat hunters and the and

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,419
the incident responders that have that

00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,240
as their title but what they oftentimes

00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,890
are we oftentimes don't look at is

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,980
anybody who's a system administrator who

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,440
has to watch that Network Zeke is open

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,110
source it's not is you know however you

00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,450
want to use it you can use it and see

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,790
proof of concept see what you need to do

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,390
with it and and learn to do that

00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:16,419
yourself you don't have to employ 15

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,650
people to do this it's available to you

00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:25,960
today but threat hunting a lot of a lot

00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:27,970
of companies use Z - I guess preempt an

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,650
attack so they're constantly monitoring

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,540
their network traffic looking for

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,960
something that's abnormal looking like

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,429
filtering out the regular traffic to see

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,470
anything that that's abnormal we have

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:40,570
this great and we have this great log

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,610
and I haven't I don't know wise I kind

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,090
of gravitate to it it's called weird and

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,370
weird is anything that that is not

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,020
already defined like you it's not

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,320
regular traffic and it's not really

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:56,020
defined by by your IDs or anything like

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,150
that but it's just abnormal activity and

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,669
it Flags it so if you're using that

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,650
weird log it breaks all the other rules

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,830
and highlights things that are unusual

00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,809
and we have one of our folks in our

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,940
community her name is Fatima and she

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:12,250
works at the University of Delaware for

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,370
their security on their security team

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:19,480
and she actually is now kicking off a

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,220
blog series on what these weird logs

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,410
really show and how to use the weird

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,070
logs more in depth so if you're someone

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,320
who is already using xik reviews bro now

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,110
sneak in the past and you have a great

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,500
like use case story or some success with

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,630
it let me know afterwards because if you

00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,700
have if you used it that way and you had

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,500
a great case then chances are somebody

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,330
else out there in the community will

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,010
want to know how you used it as well and

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,919
that's not to say we wanted you to give

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,429
up anything that is identifying how

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,799
you've got your security set framework

00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,269
set up we just want to know how how did

00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,859
Deek help you solve a problem so

00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:59,690
we can anonymize it and make sure we're

00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:01,429
not giving away any secrets that you

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:07,700
might be worried about on your network

00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:10,009
and this gets way more in-depth but the

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,959
remote Dex desktop exploitation Zeke was

00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:17,839
instrumental in a couple places to to

00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:19,909
kind of thwart those efforts and give

00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,529
people peace of mind that nothing could

00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:23,599
you know nothing was going to get across

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:26,179
or behind or sneak around their network

00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,899
or firewall or anything else so the

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:33,049
notes that I think says and one of our

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:36,200
other engineers actually have added all

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,909
the particulars about this one they're

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,829
available with the slides I'm not even

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:42,889
going to try it again because I will

00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:46,579
butcher the story but I can tell you

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:48,709
that that it is instrumental and in

00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,570
those three cases and and others so

00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:54,499
you'll be able to have access to all of

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:57,349
this and if Seth gets here then you'll

00:20:54,499 --> 00:21:00,859
be able to talk to him as well we are

00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:03,589
having some workshops some Zeke related

00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,119
workshops throughout 2020 so if you

00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:07,099
already are a Zeke user you're

00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,049
contemplating using Zeke or you have

00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,399
questions about that we're gonna have

00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,429
what's called we're calling them Zeke

00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:15,440
hours with your meetups Zeke days which

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,969
are workshops we have our Zeke week

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,579
which is our annual event and we'll have

00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:21,829
tweaked your Zeke so if you have your

00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:24,739
specific questions about your particular

00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:27,769
setup we're going to do some very

00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:29,809
tailored sessions as well to help you

00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:32,359
with those throughout 2020 so stay in

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,889
touch and or let me know my information

00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,469
will be up here in a minute and you can

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:41,149
you we'll get you involved in helping

00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:43,549
with those things so the community so

00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:47,329
Zeke has been around for about 25 years

00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:50,389
as I mentioned however there hasn't been

00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:52,219
like a big push for the community a lot

00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,209
of people didn't like they knew bro but

00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:57,200
they didn't know bro

00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:58,669
change this name physique they they were

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,769
aware but they didn't know what the

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,959
release cycles were so now we're

00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:06,710
organizing the community in such a way

00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:09,259
that it'll form it'll formulate and act

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,620
very much like all the open source

00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,600
community

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,059
use that you've been involved with so

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,830
there will be online meetings there will

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,710
you'll start seeing subgroups come up

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,330
you'll start seeing you know like I said

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,370
those meetups and those workshops and

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,850
all those things all around various

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:29,809
geographical regions both US and

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,430
internationally so right now these are -

00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,140
and most of you all know this because I

00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,420
bet all of you been participating in

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,010
open source for a long time and so you

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,140
know that participation and

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,210
communication go hand in hand that's why

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,090
you'll see a lot of the communication

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,240
tools look are exactly the same as the

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:51,230
participation sides of it we are looking

00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,640
to bring in some new infrastructure so

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,740
you probably are going to see a slack

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:01,010
channel problem be set up shortly you'll

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:04,130
probably see a few more mailing lists

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,950
that come out we're actually having the

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,140
community vote next month on the tools

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,410
they want to see so you'll see you'll

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,050
see some more tools as far as

00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,170
participation and getting help that flow

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,550
with your current workflow most of you

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,950
you know whatever your current workflow

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,380
is IRC doesn't always go with that these

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,540
days nor does a mailman mailing list so

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,700
we're going to look at what we can do to

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,309
integrate that help into the communities

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,309
workflow as it exists today so if you

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:38,690
have ideas on that I would love to to

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:41,450
hear your ideas as well so remember when

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,730
I was saying that Z can be a tool it

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,070
could be a language or it's about the

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,530
data so we break the personalities and

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,630
interests up across the community by

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:53,030
when we say users it's anybody

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:56,200
implementing adopting or otherwise using

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,690
the data derived from the logs and so

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,490
that though when you look at those

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,110
that's what we call a user and then the

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,610
developer is anybody who's writing

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,070
packages so if you're extending the

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,970
capabilities of Zeke by writing a script

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:13,250
you're writing a plugin maybe you're

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,370
writing an analyzer and anybody out here

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:19,520
written an analyzer anybody if they have

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,350
ideas for an analyzer we have a tool

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,340
that's coming out shortly

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,800
it's that coral is contributing

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,630
that will make it very easy to write

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:31,410
protocol analyzers it's very hard at the

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:34,110
moment this particular tool that's going

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,450
to come out I'm hoping by early next

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,580
year in January February to the

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,020
community it's called spicy and it gives

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,380
you the opportunity to write your own

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,330
protocol analyzers so those folks would

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,530
fall into the developer category too and

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,860
then we have our core desk because

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,080
because Zeke is the core code is C++

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,030
those are their core devs so I would if

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,570
you're already using zeker bro and

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,270
you're digging into the the code at that

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,550
level let me know we'd like to find more

00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,890
folks who are at that level or at the

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,950
developer level to get involved and get

00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,320
your feedback and there's many ways to

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,980
participate I had somebody tell me in

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,680
Atlanta well I don't write code wow you

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,360
don't have to write code there's content

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,640
there's events there's testing there's

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,350
feedback you can give anything like any

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,210
other open-source community just because

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,860
this happens to be on the cybersecurity

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,520
side doesn't mean you can't participate

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,980
like you would in any pic a desktop OS

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,320
you know and you can participate it you

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,170
can participate here and so that's why I

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,580
have like the latus I think sometimes

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,550
those of us have been around a while we

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,920
forget that to remind people that

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,290
communities are a lattice they're not a

00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,110
ladder so you pick the point you pick

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,330
your you pick your interest you pick you

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,270
know what personality you have and you

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:57,240
start there so if you're interested in

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:59,250
and Zeke as a language and you want to

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,720
write you know you want to be that

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,550
developer that's where that's going to

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,990
intersect or if you maybe your

00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,040
organization maybe you're not the

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,900
security professional in your

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,060
organization but your organization can

00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,950
host a meet-up and your security

00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,050
professionals would get the opportunity

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,060
to have you know have the open-source

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,830
engineers there and learning from them

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,080
so there's many ways you can get

00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:22,050
involved in the Zeke community and help

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,120
extend that capability and make the you

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,120
know make network safer if you will I

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:33,150
know I go too fast here so playing with

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,880
Zeke there's a lot of different ways you

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,600
can try it and I the first time I did it

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,690
because the build was broke

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,720
in a bun - I had to compile it and I and

00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:45,820
I texted some of the developers and/or

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,960
the core devs and I said if this is how

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,759
hard it is for everybody else didn't I I

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,649
feel really bad for the community cuz I

00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,820
was ready to throw my computer out the

00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:57,039
window the first time I did it

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,929
well they've updated all the

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,820
repositories and the next thing that

00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:03,789
I've done it should be released probably

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,859
not me I had somebody do it the next

00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,899
three weeks you should see a snap in the

00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:11,049
bun to snap store which actually works

00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:12,700
across 42 different distributions so not

00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,489
just the Debian based distributions that

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,619
are work on Fedora and others - so that

00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:19,059
Snap is being tested right now so you'll

00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:22,359
be able to play with Zeke straight out

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:24,429
of the snap store you can you can

00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,200
install it from the website you can get

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:27,759
it from security onion security onion

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,379
makes it very easy to download it and

00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:33,369
try it out as well so you can get it

00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:35,440
there and those those pretty logs that I

00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:37,779
was showing you earlier you can just go

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,249
to Korra and download those logs so

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:40,570
there are these cheat sheets and I

00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:43,149
wanted to have some to give out today

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,669
but we have to have them reprinted so

00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:47,379
because 3.0 just came out so they're on

00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:49,330
the website and you can you can get them

00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:53,759
in a nice neat handy I think it's a five

00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:56,619
page cheat sheet booklet kind of thing

00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,879
so this is keeping in touch with me not

00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:59,859
that you have to but you can go to the

00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:01,690
mailing list you can sign up for Zeke at

00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:04,210
Z org you can sign up for the devel

00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,979
mailing list I will tell you that I can

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,429
get I can answer some questions now but

00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:11,049
not a deep dive into how do you see

00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:14,769
because I'm just getting started on on

00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:16,210
that myself but I can probably point you

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,220
in the right direction if you have

00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,070
specific questions and I can tell you

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:24,039
who to email where to email or that kind

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,309
of stuff so if you have questions let me

00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,489
know

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:26,489
yes

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,630
so know what yes and no so there's not a

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,539
guide right now that says this is how

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:05,260
you write a protocol analyzers because

00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:07,960
it is a difficult process they're just

00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,520
it's just now how to write a script how

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,650
to write a plug-in we have tons of

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,370
information on that but that's why there

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,840
that's why Robin summer who is one of

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,750
the founders and core maintainer x' is

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,940
writing spicy to make it easier and put

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,690
those guidelines out it as well for

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,880
example I'll try to go to it here in a

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,789
second but packages echo or you can see

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,210
the ones that Amazon wrote and they were

00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:36,190
analyzers they they used all the time

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,480
and in their network how they were

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,640
looking at their network and they're

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,070
like this helps us it's going to help

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,590
the community so they they wrote it

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,390
based on the needs of their their

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,500
organization and then just released it

00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:52,840
to everyone so we don't have how to do

00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,400
that yet out there if you're interested

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,590
in doing that I can definitely put you

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,870
in touch with people just make sure just

00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,980
shoot me an email and I'll introduce you

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:02,740
to the people who can help you get

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,450
started on that because that is

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,990
something that we get asked about a lot

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,419
and nobody like Cora light or ricotta or

00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,770
security nobody can identify all the

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:14,470
different ways and all the different

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,350
analyzers that you can use on you know

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,610
that you need to parse on your network

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,740
but if you if you let us know what

00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,809
you're looking for chances are we could

00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,400
you know I'm not making promises but

00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:26,530
chances are there's somebody out in the

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,940
community that knows how to do it but

00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,530
they don't have the idea to do it so if

00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,380
we can partner everybody up

00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,080
we'll definitely we'll definitely make

00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,210
that happen does that help a little bit

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,430
me yep just just shoot me an email and

00:30:37,210 --> 00:31:04,020
we'll get

00:30:38,430 --> 00:31:05,730
yes there is and to be quite honest it's

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,820
very difficult to do with the the

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,770
open-source side I won't say difficult

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:16,290
it's tedious to do with just open source

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:19,200
alone core light has a virtual or sips

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:22,350
or a cloud sensor that makes it easy to

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,630
get to that we are looking at ways on

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:29,670
the open source side to make that easier

00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:31,470
to deploy xik in the cloud but it can be

00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:34,800
done it has been done obviously Amazon

00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,270
and others do that but it's not it's not

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,120
something that's simply just going and

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,280
downloading a sensor right now that

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,020
would or a package right now that would

00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,910
make that easy however you're interested

00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,680
in that I do know there are people who

00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:51,170
are working on that piece of it and I'm

00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,170
more than happy to connect you with them

00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,640
build what on top of the

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,309
yes well obviously they release the

00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,380
departures that they're using so so that

00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:10,270
you know I don't I don't know all the

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,210
details we've we've asked them to clear

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,720
with legal so they can speak at a couple

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,490
events

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,679
so they're now working through that

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,780
process in order to be able to to tell

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,950
everybody exactly how they did it why

00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,760
they did it what was the motivation

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,890
behind it

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,040
mitre has been forthcoming when they

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:29,080
released the bizarre scripts there's a

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,730
lot of like if you google that their

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,140
Twitter blew up the day they did that we

00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,419
didn't even know they were doing it we

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,460
found out because Twitter blew up around

00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:39,220
around those but they're in the if you

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,990
go to packages dot org The MITRE

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,660
bizarre scripts are in there too and

00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:47,049
they'll they're very public about the

00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:58,150
reasons they did that and why they put

00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:59,679
it in the in the repository well

00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,820
definitely like if you shoot me an email

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,470
I'll put you in touch with our

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,610
developers that are our open-source

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,610
developers that are working on that

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:21,299
oh yeah so Zeke isn't isn't the solution

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,769
it's not the end-all be-all however a

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:28,230
lot of the this the the monitoring

00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:31,110
stacks have Zeke in there because he

00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:36,179
gives you the the logs so one company

00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:38,279
may want to use I don't know well some

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:39,059
folks pair Zeke with sir cata because of

00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,909
the signatures

00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,529
some folks pair they take that

00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:46,409
information and run it through elastic

00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:48,059
or Splunk or or whatever but they get

00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:52,500
the data from several different places

00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:55,169
and Zeke is just one level of logs that

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,360
you can look at so it's not it wouldn't

00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:59,429
be something that somebody would use

00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,049
solely standalone by itself it just

00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:02,820
gives you that deep look in and then

00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:06,570
what you do with it people pair it with

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:11,010
several other third party tools to get

00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:14,490
their whole stack and and if you go to

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:17,250
the Zico org mailing list there is a lot

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,960
of discussion around how people are

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,970
using it and what they're pairing it

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,099
with and you may have to go back to

00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,629
little ways because sometimes again like

00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:26,460
all communities when you've been around

00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:29,040
there for a while and and you forget

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,839
what it's like to be new you you know

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,099
all the new stuff happened like maybe a

00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:34,409
couple years before so you got to go

00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:36,210
back a little bit but then people revive

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,550
those threads all the time because oh

00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,359
I'm now using this or I want a pair Zeke

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,399
in sericata

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,250
or I want to pair Zeke and whatever it

00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,540
happens to be and so there's always the

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,950
discussion on the mailing lists about

00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,409
those type of things so feel free to

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:51,869
revive any thread or stand up a new one

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,220
and ask because all the core maintainer

00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:58,849
z' and all the open-source developers

00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,849
monitor disease org mailing list

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,599
anything else and for those who weren't

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,060
in here when i was setting up and

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,760
getting my computer set up if you have a

00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,920
business card or if you need one you can

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,390
write your stuff on mine

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,180
tomorrow's talk when i'm in the career

00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,609
track i'm talking about how to you know

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,359
not worry about being afraid to try new

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:24,510
things i'm gonna give away the arm board

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,819
that has raspbian pre-installed and zeke

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,869
on it the reason i'm not giving away in

00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,829
this talk is because I still have to

00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:30,299
flash it I have the

00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:32,729
cards ridic I have the images ready I

00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:34,200
just have to flash it so so if you want

00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:36,420
to if you want to be in that talk cause

exercises that we're gonna be rolling

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:54,869
out next year that has to do with not

00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:57,449

00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:59,729
plus sake to give you that ability to

00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,690

00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:02,069

00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:07,469

make sure that you know or let you know

00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:13,619
what's going to be the closest one to

00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,809
where you're at because I think this

00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,079
capture the flag exercises are quite fun

00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:21,119
and it takes hours or not for our

00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,400
capture the flag that we have distilled

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,999
them down to about 2 hours so it's a

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,589
two-hour exercise and a lot of times we

00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:32,099
bring in some of the Sands instructors

00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:33,839
and other instructors who are working

00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,910
with us on those programs to actually

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,259
help facilitate those so if you want to

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,319
talk to sands people if you want to talk

00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:42,289

00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:45,950
