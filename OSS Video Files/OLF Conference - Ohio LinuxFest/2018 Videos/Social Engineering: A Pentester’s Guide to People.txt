	00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,350
okay we're gonna give it another minute

00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:13,000
we're gonna start now right up for now

00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,009
it's 4:00 so I guess you guys haven't

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,630
seen my presentation before couple

00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,250
ground rules I recommend you turn on

00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,899
your phone's going silent because if not

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,960
I will come over and wait for you to

00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:24,070
finish your phone call second if you

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,630
have any questions during the

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,669
presentation feel free to just shout

00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,200
them at me no need to even raise your

00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,970
hand just literally just yell at me it's

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,290
fine so my presentation from last year

00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:37,780
okay so whew this is gonna be fun for

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,960
the best I like to on flew the audience

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,210
have fun with everybody so this is

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,460
social engineering and pen testers guide

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,810
people this is also not going to be one

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,310
of those presentations where you can't

00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,520
read what's on the slide everything's

00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,350
gonna be that size about so even people

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,910
sitting way in the back or if you have

00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:03,010
so many taller sitting in front of your

00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:06,820
line so it's flamer I'm not a lawyer

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:11,710
even if it sounds like everyone finally

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:13,300
glowed advice elsewhere this is for the

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,030
people who are a little sleepy in the

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,770
audience who might have had a little bit

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,299
of nap time I like to call this the

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,010
red-eye audience because if I get this

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,799
talk in the morning everybody's super

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,210
tired from flying in and after lunch

00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,580
everybody's super tired because their

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,500
life it's nap time now has anybody

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,970
noticed something special about the I in

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,110
particular besides the people who saw

00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:37,900
the presentation last year all right

00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:41,340
I mean larger for you guys can anybody

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,340
tell what's up VI now

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,230
about now the entire eye itself is

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,270
literally made up of ones and zeros so

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,700
even the smaller woman's down here in

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,710
the corner you don't notice things that

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,470
are in front of you until you actually

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,950
are explicitly haven't pointed out to

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,950
you

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,870
so since every single person walked into

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,490
the room that's been sitting on the main

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,780
slide but I'm going to assume that most

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,850
people probably didn't know that that

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,950
was there that's kind of like what this

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,320
presentation is going to be like it's

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,360
about cognitive biases and the social

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,130
engineering aspects of how you actually

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,330
rely on those so it's going to be a

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:31,130
little bit like the psychology lesson

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:31,130
today to hopefully overrule Dumfries on

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,290
about this guy this picture is probably

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,420
like a decade old at this point but I

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,200
just kind of like it specifically

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,700
because I can do this with it and this

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,940
is a story essentially about how I

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,820
became a free malakut from a software

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,980
pirate by the way I used to get for a

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,430
lot of these stuff in here do not let my

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,600
terrible terrible use of me actually

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,550
define what you think you can do with it

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:08,220
so that is actually one of the old

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,900
Photoshop logos and that's a little

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,790
dinosaur that I used him to crop out and

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,560
stick on there I like to call it death

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,950
of the Dino because many many years ago

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,810
I used to run Windows like most people

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:23,940
and I happen to be using Photoshop now

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,450
my photoshop skills are pretty much

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,550
limited to cropping and well that's

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,340
pretty much it I like to crop photos out

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,030
stick them on people's heads weird

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,850
things like that at some point when

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,770
Creative Cloud came around what a lot of

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,970
people don't know is that even Creative

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,980
Cloud products or things that are

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,810
continuously talking outside of your own

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,090
local environment you can actually

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,800
download copies of them activate trial

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,840
versions and essentially cut off access

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,670
to them so that they're not reaching out

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,870
while they're still activated what that

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,580
means is you essentially don't get

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,130
updates for them but the program itself

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,710
will still work when Creative Cloud came

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,750
out I considered doing that with it and

00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,220
then I was like this is really stupid I

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,660
should actually just download some free

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,810
alternatives and take the time to learn

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,070
them so I can go one it being legal in

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,810
two so I don't have to run around and

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,580
try and do all this fun stuff so that's

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,560
my very short background on how I

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,820
actually became a freedom advocate

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,010
instead from software piracy so who are

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,420
social engineers salespeople marketers

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,980
teachers professors you guys I mean

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,110
everybody that literally encompasses

00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,550
everybody in one

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,340
another every person sitting in this

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:36,230
room does perform some sort of social

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,420
engineering at some point and the reason

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,580
being is because when you try and sway

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,070
someone's thoughts or opinions you are

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:48,830
essentially attempting to social

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:50,510
engineer that first of all it's just the

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,100
newest term computer science theory

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,440
folks do like pretending were smart so

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,710
we can't let me to term for it but it's

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,960
been around literally forever and it's

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,300
practically impossible to interact with

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,560
someone without actually social

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,080
engineering then because your mere

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,670
presence actually provides an input that

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,790
that person has to filter through their

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:15,230
own cognitive biases and interpret what

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:18,470
that particular meaning is so the next

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,630
one all social engineering is based on

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,350
some form of a cognitive bias in one way

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:27,860
or another all this is a deviation from

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:31,720
normal thinking that's the baseline for

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,250
cognitive biases speaking back to

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,140
providing input all that essentially

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,390
says is that an individual is present

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,980
they smile they say hello at you you

00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,560
actually have to interpret that through

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,900
your own personal biases and your view

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,220
of the world meaning that you are

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,660
interpreting what that actually means

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,580
that person or actually made a horrible

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,410
human being and things that smiling is

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,420
something terrible but your own personal

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,430
interactions and prior experiences have

00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,050
told you that if somebody is smiling

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,490
says hello team that means they're

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,880
probably a kind of diversity so that few

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,880
different types

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,060
[Music]

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,410
Attribution social biases very simple

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,500
it's essentially essentially assigning

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,699
what someone's behavior means

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,830
decision-making belief behavioral those

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,330
are exactly what they sound like and the

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,039
memory errors which are actually some of

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,630
my favorite ones is essentially

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
something we came to most people think

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,190
of like gaslighting which is attempting

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,229
to actually alter someone's ability of

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,300
what they remember inserting false

00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,360
memories those sorts of things this is

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,460
also why if you ever watch any criminal

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,860
justice type shows that they essentially

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,449
will not allow a lawyer to ask leading

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,849
questions because you are essentially

00:06:52,449 --> 00:07:01,330
attempting to move that person towards a

00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:03,310
particular decision so we're gonna start

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,690
with our first ones naive realism which

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,160
is the belief that we see in reality as

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,250
it actually is and not interpreted

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,229
through our bias hopefully everybody

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:14,740
understands now that everyone is subject

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:17,259
to that one more or less you have your

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,150
in-group bias tendency for people to get

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:21,280
preferential treatment to people who are

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,580
in their own group which is a simple us

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,490
versus them mentality bandwagon effect

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,409
which is the tendency to do other things

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,150
that people believe things that you see

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,949
them acting like here's a perfect

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,210
example essentially why are we waiting

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:35,409
in this line I don't know if there's a

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,720
line when I figured I was supposed to

00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:43,330
wait you guys can laugh at all of my

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,979
stupid things I won't move in there

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,750
actually I'm a Ben Franklin effect which

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,360
is essentially when someone performs a

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,630
favor they are more likely to acquiesce

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,240
to further favors later on down the road

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,740
that's Ben Franklin the reason that this

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,710
actually got this is because Ben

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,389
Franklin would go in and he would think

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,729
about something that he wanted to get

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,650
from an individual later on but before

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,090
he actually did his major asked what he

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,860
would actually do is he would request a

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,930
copy of a book like this

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,639
this is biography by the way Walter

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,009
Isaacson I don't know if anybody reads

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
Matthews here fantastic guy who does

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,729
biographies however they're like in

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,050
contagion stick so you will know more

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:28,070
about that person's life if you ever

00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,870
wanted to know next we have a framing

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,729
effect which is drawing different

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,680
conclusions from the same piece of

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:38,800
information depending on how it is

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,270
actually presented the client isn't

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:47,660
really simple it essentially is the past

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:50,150
was better the futures terrible Foreman

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,290
Barnum effect now this one is actually

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,730
quite interesting in that because you

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,040
are essentially giving higher accuracy

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,980
ratings to things that are tailored to

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,660
you they come up in readings almost read

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,610
all that fun sort of stuff

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,790
for example this one's literally off the

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,410
top of my head by the way is if I saw

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,080
anybody in the room and I said you know

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,120
what I really think that you tend to be

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,070
a near among your specific group of

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,540
friends but I can definitely tell the

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,190
times when somebody has something will

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,950
they're very passionate about you also

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,330
let them leave and take the take the

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,510
lead for that particular area of

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,800
interest for them I see a few people

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,420
actually nodding our heads in that

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,760
scenario that's something that's

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,890
extremely vague but applies to most

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,750
people next we have a confirmation bias

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,920
essentially you try and understand and

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,110
search for things that you already

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,580
confirmed as your own bias some of these

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,580
people are very familiar with

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,380
not so much subjective validation is

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,790
essentially that you are required to

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,520
believe something in order for it to be

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,710
more true which is why going back to the

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,080
Barnum effect because you are actually

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,940
required to believe what I'm saying that

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,920
scenario it makes it more likely that

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:10,850
you will believe it risk compensation

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,100
and health effect tendency to take

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:18,020
greater risks when perceived safety is

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,580
increased relatively standard also very

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,260
useful and most people actually lose

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,350
this pretty often without knowing about

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,410
it next we have zero risk which is a

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,120
tendency for people to prefer gaining

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,070
something to a zero risk value as

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,010
opposed to producing something larger

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:35,750
that they couldn't so permit example if

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,640
I have a 10 percent chance of something

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,410
happening but I can reduce it to zero

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,670
I'm more likely to choose that and

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,590
reducing something that's a 90 percent

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:51,560
chance of happening but only reducing it

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:53,060
to 75 percent ambiguity I also like to

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,380
give everybody a few seconds just to

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,590
read this line so you're actually paying

00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,870
attention simple one that's essentially

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,820
if you don't have all the information or

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,550
options it is difficult in try to make

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,470
the decision when it's not listed in the

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,750
slide deck which is also an information

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,790
bias essentially means that you continue

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,260
to gather information without actually

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:20,690
making a decision and so it's kind of

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:23,630
like information paralysis one rest stop

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,270
effect an item that sticks out is more

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,270
likely to be noticed than any other item

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,370
anchoring of vocalism you tend to give

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:41,090
more Hemans to the things that you are

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:42,860
first given or a specific idea courtesy

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:46,390
bias which I guarantee you at some point

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,130
if not every single person has

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,360
Douglas in one for my mother I would be

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,360
very surprised

00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,400
[Laughter]

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,460
a lot of laughter and agreement for

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,710
everybody who's sitting in the front by

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,030
the leg like half the crowd behind you

00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,030
either started laughing or their wife

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:25,990
can't see the screen it's heads okay how

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,080
about you just tell us okay I couldn't

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,100
do that but come on now there's all

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,510
right this is what I would say about

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,070
that one there are also seats in the

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,690
front if you are sitting somewhere I

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:42,490
would give you the opportunity to come

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:44,140
up right now no okay there you go

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:56,230
come on don't be afraid these people

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:59,050
aren't gonna bite you probably alright

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,120
next we have false memory essentially a

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,220
form of misattribution where the

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,570
imagination is mistaken for an actual

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,450
memory itself things that you've

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,030
essentially thought of illusory

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,750
correlation inaccurately remembering

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,810
things and then the last one which is

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,210
the key one is leveling and sharpening

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,370
essentially what that means is that as

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,320
remember has become aged you tend to

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,200
sharpen specific events and give more

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,090
meaning to them and you also level out

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,700
so because you are forgetting certain

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,710
things you are actually giving much more

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,200
precedence to things that might not have

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,290
been as important that's a very very

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,330
simple explanation for that there are a

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,370
lot more cognitive biases and then what

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,960
I'm going to go through here so if

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,210
you're really interested in it no look

00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,580
online and find the rest of them and

00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,110
then we have cognitive dissonance which

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,300
is essentially if you are holding two

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,920
beliefs in your heads do not mesh you

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,360
are essentially trying to get rid of

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,240
them and just have one belief that you

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:04,080
actually have the second one just does

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,080
the same thing I just said

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,270
all right now we're going to get into

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,910
some different actual social engineering

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,220
techniques bathing and fishing which is

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,800
spear and whale fishing voice efficient

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,460
water holing pretexting tailgating quid

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,490
pro quo and that's it you don't actually

00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,550
use all of these necessarily for your

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,810
everyday life but since we were gonna go

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,010
over some of the social engineering

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,050
stuff I've included of them and just

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,410
tell you guys where they are first one

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:38,740
beating real-world Trojan horse very

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,230
simple uses physical media relies on

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,850
curiosity green pick picking random

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:52,000
objects up sticking on your computer the

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:54,190
classic USB drop attack they might

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,650
include depending on how in-depth

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,390
somebody wants to get corporate logos if

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,370
you've been to a convention or somebody

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,529
actually hands out USB drives with their

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,330
branded logos on them it'd be a pretty

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,770
good idea like oh I don't know if your

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,020
social engineer and you want to attack

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,660
that particular company to put on

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,740
whatever you want on their actual USB

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,180
drives and just drop them because

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,279
they're already branded by the company

00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,310
so if you were to go to that company and

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,450
drop them on the ground assume that they

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,450
already belong to the company

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,460
that mostly references they rubber ducky

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,590
attack which is essentially it's your

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,440
USB Drive is recognized as a hint device

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,760
which is human interface device and just

00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,920
inserting it will essentially more or

00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,240
less tell it that it's a keyboard and so

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:57,520
we'll run through a bunch of commands

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:59,320
very quickly question I'm going to say

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,330
that if you actually physically have

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,620
access to a machine you are not going to

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,210
be doing something like this because it

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,610
really wouldn't make a difference if you

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,560
are a physically president up to

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,030
compromise somebody by inserting

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
invisible media in time for the most

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,970
part you already have access to machines

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:28,390
so you're not going to try and attempt

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:31,090
for a lot of environment yeah you're

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:34,000
much much safer that way later it is it

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,800
possible for most people and probably

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,970
even for most people to do penetration

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,350
testing that is not going to be

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,080
something that's going to be probable

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,490
however if you were a nation state actor

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,620
and you specifically were targeting

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,780
somebody you would probably consider

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,820
that however if that's your angle can

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,170
compromise the Machine it's still going

00:16:48,820 --> 00:17:03,820
to be more likely that it's going to be

00:16:50,170 --> 00:17:05,470
easier to be an access to some other to

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,820
repeat what he just said if you are

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,040
actually operating in a live environment

00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,720
and you want to do ion topping which is

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,940
essentially moving into another

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,070
environment on the network is that

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,480
possible yes but that also goes into the

00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,959
VM escapes and all that fun sort of

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:26,470
stuff any other questions

00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:34,990
I mean honestly like stop sticking stuff

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:35,830
in here I I can see that now that we're

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,420
actually getting into what they were

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,260
labeled I see that you will be very

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,640
susceptible to some of these the stuff

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,980
that you would typically label on them

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,080
would be like accounting information

00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,730
salaries prototype designs depending on

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,070
what type of business it is private

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:54,540
slash confidential and certain

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,540
susceptibility is to some people here

00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:02,850
ex-boyfriend or boyfriend and pictures

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:04,420
of them next way of fishing you

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,070
fraudulently obtain information

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,640
typically through the use of email

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,640
specifically

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,230
email contains the link you click on the

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,580
link they compromised your machine

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,840
that's the standard the most people

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,840
think of when they're thinking efficient

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,790
so we have spear and whale general

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,470
phishing campaigns are send a lot of

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,350
lines of information so that's the

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,510
general hi I'm a Nigerian prince and I'd

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,670
love for you to actually help me filter

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,840
through 100 million dollars Logan you

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:49,960
tended spear is actually sending

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,780
customized ones specifically to a large

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,150
targeted audience so in a company a

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,950
great place to actually do information

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,840
gathering for example is LinkedIn where

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,430
people put their resumes because they

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,830
are obviously looking for potential

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:07,570
other jobs this has actually been an

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:09,760
issue where in the DoD and NSA etc

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,550
people have put projects that they are

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,830
working on that are supposed to be

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:19,480
top-secret projects but they're like hey

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:21,550
I worked on this so if you think that

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,500
they're not doing in the government

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,240
trust me somebody has put some

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,560
information inside of their company and

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,790
said I worked on this project that was

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,600
actually not supposed to be a project

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,860
that was out in the open and next we

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,810
have whaling which is going after

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,880
executives and as I mentioned the

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,680
success rate for our spear and whaling

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,120
attacks is highly dependent on the

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,180
actual following the information that

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,400
you're able to gather before so a

00:19:46,180 --> 00:20:01,330
perfect example of this would be that

00:19:48,400 --> 00:20:04,480
Smokey's up all right then you have a

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,790
fishing which is voice phishing social

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,450
engineering over the telephone system

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:13,180
very simple useful for reconnaissance

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,650
gathering detailed information past the

00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,540
point of the things that you can

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,210
typically find through other open source

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,460
means like linkedin social media

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,930
profiles all that fun sorts of stuff if

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,710
you actually need to call to gather

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,480
further

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,610
this is a perfect use of it the second

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,260
portion of that which isn't directly

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,870
related to our constants would be like

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:41,169
the classic Microsoft scans or something

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:42,730
ecology and they're like hey you have a

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,200
virus on your computer call this number

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,610
that's not associated with Microsoft at

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,179
all and we'll help you get rid of it

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:53,100
that is the very very basic version of

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,100
an interactive voice prompt one for it

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,249
[Music]

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,190
next we have water only so that places

00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,560
trust on users actually visiting

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,390
websites regularly so if you regularly

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,940
go to Facebook you regularly log into

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,950
your bank account you more or less trust

00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:25,530
that those websites are going to be what

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:27,180
you think they are a nice bit about this

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,520
is what our home in particular does

00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,350
actually require for the most part

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,760
preparation ahead of time so you can

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,030
understand what your victim or your

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,560
target is actually working at so you

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,350
want to do some sort of traffic analysis

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,810
in terms of what your what their what

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:46,650
they are seeing target feels safe

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,870
because they've been to the level to say

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,210
it a thousand times everything looks the

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,269
same

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,269
[Music]

00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,300
I've been guilty of that last one what

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,550
it essentially says is a purpose a

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,710
person might avoid clicking a link in

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,630
email for example typically but let's

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,690
say that it's a contact that you

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,220
regularly talk to and you are very

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,750
familiar with them and maybe you guys

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,880
send encrypted emails back and forth

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,380
well you are more likely for example to

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
click that link because you know that

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,890
the other person is still operating in a

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,320
secure environment and it's probably not

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,820
sending you something that's fishy does

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,660
that mean that it's not no not

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,670
necessarily

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,950
but you might click something like that

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:33,810
over sending a regular income here's a

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,510
water one example is essentially what

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,170
your targets look like they're all just

00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:42,030
shell now and having fun drink the water

00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:52,580
home and this is pretty much what you

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:54,950
look like very and we have pretexting so

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,180
pretexting invented scenarios

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,880
essentially is providing an environment

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,440
in a situation ahead of time so that

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,670
your target will actually believe

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,940
whatever the hell it is that you're

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,940
saying

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,519
this is where a prior research

00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:12,960
especially if you're doing any sort of

00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,889
an efficient voice or countries work

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,980
comes very very handy because as an

00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:22,320
example if I'm going to do a penetration

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,370
test on a company and I find out that

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,370
