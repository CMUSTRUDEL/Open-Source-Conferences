Title: OLF 2018 - Wallet Cryptography 101
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Cryptocurrency relies heavily on cryptography to operate securely and reliably. But how does it work? How does a wallet recovery phrase establish and recover a cryptocurrency wallet? How do I keep my cryptocurrency private and secure? This talk will discuss various wallet types, understanding how seed/recovery phrases work, and how to keep them secure. I will demonstrate using docker and electron to use tools to validate recovery passphrases.

I'm going to talk about cryptocurrency

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:12,840
or wallet cryptography and gonna kind of

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,719
give a high-level overview but it

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,760
whenever you talk about anything

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,100
cryptographic it gets deep in the weeds

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,830
pretty quickly so I'll give you that

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,220
fair warning if you've done anything

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,680
with cryptocurrency already either a

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,900
theory more Bitcoin this may be old news

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,290
to you but hopefully I can share some

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,829
things that might help you at least keep

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:41,430
your digital asset safe or improve your

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,050
security and give you some tips for some

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,910
things that maybe you haven't been doing

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,039
already

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,760
my name is Steve swing

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,129
I'm the substratum CTO substratum is a

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,559
Delaware Ohio company we were a

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,280
crowdfunded to fight internet censorship

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,230
that's our elevator pitch basically

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,690
we're working on software written and

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,979
rust to be able to do clandestine

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:13,470
routing so similar purposes as what you

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,450
might use tor or VPN for but in those

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,610
have vulnerabilities or they're designed

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,280
for a slightly different purpose our

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,130
intent is for portions of the world that

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,740
don't have access to the free and open

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,799
Internet that currently we're still able

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,310
to enjoy we want to be able to provide

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,820
that technical technical means to solve

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,060
that problem to work around you know

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:44,880
governments that want to prevent free

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:47,520
and open Internet all right so I've got

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,350
a number of slides here that that

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,899
basically give examples of what we're

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,329
talking about when we talk about

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,460
cryptocurrency wallets they go from the

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,740
the prepper version this might be

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,659
interesting to you if you think the EMP

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,329
is going to take out all of our

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:09,410
electronics and you can etch your words

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,750
on metal that's resistant and

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:17,090
we'll talk about what these words mean

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:19,640
and where they come from you can use a

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,320
paper wallet of form where you can

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,780
generate a QR code that you can share

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:30,400
and you can keep your private key

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:33,260
private and use a printed paper wallet

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,650
you can even have a little USB dongle

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,690
device that prints that little that key

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,080
for you that'd be a dress that you can

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:45,170
share you keep your private key every

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,480
time this mycelium device is inserted

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:53,150
into a compatible printer it'll generate

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,500
a new address that you can use perhaps

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,230
you've heard of some other hardware

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:01,100
wallets like the ledger line of products

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,260
this is a ledger nan OS it's a USB

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,960
device you plug in you use little

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,030
buttons on the one or two line display

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,330
to enter your pin code or passphrases

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:13,700
and go into modes that are specific to

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,470
each cryptocurrency denomination that

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,060
you're trying to work with whether it's

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,260
a theorem or a Bitcoin or some of the

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,510
others a little more advanced version

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,460
that they have a different product same

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,910
kind of a thing but a touch screen

00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,850
display where you can select the coin

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:37,070
type that you want to work with and

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:38,690
interact with with your wallet it

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,670
basically maintains your private keys

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:44,930
for you treasure is another example of

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,350
different orientation of the two buttons

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:53,960
style kind of a thing with more lines to

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,760
display keep key I think the interface

00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,960
or the screen on this is touch sensitive

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,390
so that you can navigate and control it

00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,240
all these kind of have a common you know

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,110
physical aspect Hardware wallet wise

00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,640
then we get into some software wallets

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,650
one of the earliest ones is bitcoin

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,130
square or they renamed themselves to

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,579
bisque uses a cute cross-platform

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,270
development type of thing and

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,800
Bitcoin there a number of other versions

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,980
of this type of wallet that probably

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,720
came from you know one of the few

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:35,410
several originating projects that

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,560
provide wallets

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,090
electrum is another example and then we

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,920
get into mobile wallets only you can't

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,740
read this at all but the point of this

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,510
is they're even more now I think when I

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,010
took this screenshot there were this

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,800
there were 170 when I took this

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,419
screenshot last night I looked and are

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,870
like 181 so there are a lot of options

00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:03,320
and even some for iOS surprisingly

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,000
enough all right what are we talking

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,190
about

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,380
so the cryptocurrency wallet doesn't

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,350
actually store your coins or tokens in

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,480
that little device certainly certainly

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,510
the little metal thing that you had your

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,419
your words into your mnemonic phrase

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:23,419
can't hold the Bitcoin or the

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:25,220
cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies soared

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:29,750
in the transactions on the blockchain

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,169
so it's either unspent transaction

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,260
outputs that Bitcoin uses or in the case

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:40,430
of like an ER C 20 compatible token like

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:45,430
aetherium the smart contract state holds

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:47,780
the current balance for a wallet address

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,150
so essentially these wallets are a

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,850
mechanism to just keep track of our

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,760
private keys keeping our private keys

00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:00,290
private and giving us the public key so

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,780
that you can verify that you're the

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,540
owner of the private key or the public

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:11,300
the private key everybody has the public

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:12,560
key and so you in order to not lose your

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,340
cryptocurrency you have to keep your

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,380
private keys private in secret so

00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,300
another analogy as you can sort of think

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,090
of of your crypto currency wallet more

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,640
like a debit card so your debit card

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,820
doesn't hold any money in that little

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,860
piece of plastic the newer ones have the

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,670
chip that basically authorized you as

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,190
the holder

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:38,630
to be able to withdraw funds from your

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:42,140
banking account using that card and

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:49,580
ideally the pin so you sort of prove

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:51,650
that you have the private key and with

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,100
all types of wallets we have different

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,960
sorts of downsides or negatives there no

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,710
one solution is perfect

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,910
they all have things that you need to be

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:09,410
aware of for example with paper you know

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:14,060
a fire can easily burn up a lot of it

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:18,010
going in not much time at all or flood

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:22,040
or your printer ink could fade over time

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:24,590
and if you memorize your mnemonic phrase

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,540
and keep it in your brain all it takes

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:31,760
is one good conk on the head and you've

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:34,220
maybe forgotten your phrase software we

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,850
need to be you know diligent in their

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,320
day jobs for keeping data safe but when

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,140
we're talking about cryptocurrency we

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,820
have to also have to be aware of

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:49,220
unauthorized access and it's a financial

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,210
loss maybe more immediate than what data

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:56,090
seems when you lose data it's still a

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,690
financial loss but it's hard to quantify

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,660
a lot of times and then you know with

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:06,370
Hardware wallets if you're gnomonic

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:12,910
phrase is leaked or you forget it then

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,910
it's it's subject to loss as well

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,540
hello

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,380
sorry about that

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,140
alright so what are we talking about

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,970
cryptocurrency wallets use asymmetric

00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,070
cryptography right you've got the

00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,910
public/private key pair and they go

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,310
together you need to use a private key

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,860
to decrypt to decrypt data that's been

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:48,880
encrypted with the public key you need

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,830
to confirm that you verify the signature

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,270
with the public key that's been signed

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,770
with the private key so those are the

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,920
kinds of things that we're talking about

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,060
when we use public and private keys very

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,600
similar to the SSH keys you might use

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:12,510
for authentication or similar to website

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,540
identity for certificates there's that

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,050
signature type of cryptography involved

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,940
as well and for communication there's

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,360
well and you'll see in in some of the

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,750
formulas here there's a hash based

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,310
method message authentication code that

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,580
can be used to verify that a message

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,380
hasn't been tampered with and then all

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,980
involved with all of these are the sha

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:46,000
variants for secure hashing algorithm so

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,190
and you may see sha one two and three

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,240
but know that also what they're talking

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:56,710
about is most likely sha-1 is 128 I

00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:02,200
think right but shot 2 and 256 or sha

00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:09,090
three 384 and chopped 512 being the most

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:11,140
common ones used for crypto currency so

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,610
much to my surprise when I was

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,760
researching this that there are actually

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:22,210
standards around Bitcoin and Bitcoin

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:24,250
technologies that go into these well

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,620
these are examples of the standards that

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:32,530
go into defining cryptocurrency wallets

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,530
and what we're using so we're gonna look

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:39,260
at like four of

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:42,740
there are others that influence or or

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,210
control how a particular coin might work

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,750
through the standard that they've

00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:54,200
adopted but these are in github and you

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:57,690
can review them and look at their their

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,090
reference implementations often a couple

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,300
of them provide test cases so that if

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,790
you're implementing your own software

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,250
stack that implements a standard you can

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,560
base your test case on those standards

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,540
to verify that your implementation

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,380
matches what other languages are

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,770
developed some of these aren't even

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,900
finalized some are just proposed but yet

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:30,240
they've they're kind of in use as de

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:33,000
facto standards so yeah so the first one

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,700
looking at VAP 32 which is the

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,710
definition of hierarchical deterministic

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:43,170
wallets VIP 32 defines the the path of

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:47,250
derivation functions that it's used

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:50,040
that's used to generate child keys from

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:55,790
a master key node so the whole thing

00:11:50,040 --> 00:12:00,180
starts here as an input of entropy and

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:04,170
this is your master seed that is hashed

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:09,450
and you end up with a master node of a

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:11,910
key pair and then at each path level

00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,110
which is basically a recursive descent

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:19,490
tree where you've got the first index

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,960
you can use any digit at each level and

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,510
pass it through this child key

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,880
derivation function and you end up with

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,720
a new key pair that can then be fed into

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:36,630
the next level and at each level it adds

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:39,210
a different value and you generate new

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,570
new child keys at each level until

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:46,520
you're ready to stop till it takes too

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,520
long to to compute them

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,660
b.a.p 39 is a mechanism by which most

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,490
people are familiar with if they're

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,130
using a hardware wallet they're they're

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,920
familiar with the initialization seed

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,620
words that hardware while it presents

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,290
when it's first initialized so you get a

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,410
number of words it depends on the amount

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:16,330
of entropy that you want to use to set

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:20,290
up your wallet the entropy is encoded in

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,900
multiples of 32 bits and so it needs to

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:28,600
be a multiple of 32 and it can be from

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,440
128 to 256 currently at each level that

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,960
entropy is divided by 32 and you end up

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,210
with an amount of checksum that's

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,870
necessary to verify that that the

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:44,290
mnemonic sentence actually is correct so

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:49,900
there's a built-in checksum and the

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:53,350
checksum is based on 248 words that are

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,980
in an award index basically an a decimal

00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:01,660
value is generated from 11 bits and the

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,550
11 bits the 11 bit value in decimal is

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,710
the index in the word list I have an

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,910
example of this that kind of walks it

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:11,440
through more clearly

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,900
I hope where I try to explain it so

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:20,170
let's say our mnemonic phrase is 24

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:25,270
words the word lists are defined in the

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:28,930
VIP 39 standard so there are a fixed 200

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:31,900
you have 248 what list of words indexes

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,640
zero to 247 because that's what will fit

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,200
in 11 bits and there are different word

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,750
lists for different languages and

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,050
they're not just translations of the

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,690
words they're completely different words

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,220
that can't be I think they are I don't

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,390
read most of the languages so I don't

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,390
know so you've got 256 bits of entropy

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:04,450
it looks like that in bits plus the 8

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:08,650
bits checksum and that's a total of 264

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:14,370
bits so if you were to look at it in

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,370
nibbles which is kind of close to 11

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:25,690
you've got 12 12 bits in 22 rows but we

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:28,210
what we need is 24 words so we're gonna

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:32,380
steal one bit from each row and add it

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:35,800
to the next row etc not quite that

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:45,750
scrambled but you end up with 24 rows of

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:45,750
11 bits still 250 264 bits total so then

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:52,930
those binary bits are converted to

00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,270
decimal index and you end up with the

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,510
word so the important thing to capture

00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,320
if you're going to capture anything

00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,300
especially if you're going to etch it on

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,480
the metal where you might not have

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,890
access to a computer because of the EMP

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:11,680
the the thing that matters is the index

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:15,430
the word is just a handy mnemonic get it

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:23,550
that helps us remember what that index

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:26,620
word was so be IP 44 this is a

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,690
refinement of the VIP 32 standard that

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,770
defines the segmentation or the paths

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:40,770
for defining the the child keys and the

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:43,900
derivations 44 actually puts

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:47,530
descriptions on each of the levels so

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:52,270
they say that from your master key the

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:54,850
first path segment is a purpose and then

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,730
a coin type or an account and then a

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,130
change which bitcoin uses a change

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:05,140
address and then you end up with an

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,580
individual address index so you note

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,340
this little prime here that was

00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,700
intentional

00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:14,220
it's really 44 Prime is that is the

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,980
purpose and what that indicates is it's

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,830
a hardened derivation path if you read

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,850
the bi period 32 standard using the key

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:26,550
derivation function if you use values

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:29,370
less than two billion in that key

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,560
derivation when you do the descent some

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,820
of those combinations are vulnerable to

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,850
leakage if someone gets the private key

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:45,200
they can derive all the remaining keys

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:45,200
in that tree or depends on the value

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,990
then in this case VIP 44 defines that

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,540
the second segment is the coin type so

00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,970
this is where you see different coin

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:04,680
values 60 prime happens to be for

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:09,420
aetherium I know Bitcoin has used 44 but

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:11,910
also 49 prime I've seen and then from an

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,450
account so an account is just what I

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:18,870
choose to use it's a hardened address

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,960
but typically zeros is used most

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:24,660
commonly but starting from actually it

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,640
would be this high order bit is set so

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:32,220
it's going to be when it's when it's 0

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,360
prime it's actually this number and 8

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:41,760
followed by seven zeros and those

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:47,190
hardened values actually go from 0 8

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:49,460
followed by seven zeros to 8 FS and if

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,450
you're looking at them in hexadecimal

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,450
very very large number

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,210
now where you see these things most

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,970
common if you're familiar with my ether

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:06,270
wallet my ether wallet is a website it's

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,090
basically an HTML page that encodes a

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,390
number of these standards so that you

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:16,470
can use this HTML page to basically

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:21,090
access your wallet and send aetherium

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:23,580
transactions on the ethereum network and

00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,760
here's when you unlock your wallet

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,580
here's what a the next screen you're

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,110
presented with and something should look

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,680
sort of familiar now hopefully for

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,310
aetherium

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:42,000
the purpose type is 44 because it's the

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,550
VAP 44 standard and then 60 indicates

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,900
aetherium and since we're dealing with

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,790
my ether wallet that's what this

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:55,020
indicates you will see some of the other

00:19:49,790 --> 00:20:00,150
coin types listed and so if you wish to

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:05,370
hide your money sort of you can actually

00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,950
choose if you had a Ledge or Hardware

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:13,320
wallet you can actually use this

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:14,940
particular brand treasure and basically

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,690
it doesn't matter there's different

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:26,730
software implementations that utilize

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:28,800
the different derivation paths so 44 is

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,140
the purpose this is a coin type this is

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,470
the account and then if you're looking

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,050
at the the bottom of the page it's

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,320
showing you all the end indexes so like

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,790
for example when you pull it up it won't

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,850
be all zeros it'll be for your

00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,610
particular mnemonic phrase or your your

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:52,950
key store that you've opened or unlocked

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:56,720
using my ether wallet meta mask is

00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:00,420
another option for using a browser-based

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,110
extension I don't have a lot of

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,000
experience with it so

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,330
well we're talking about with wallet

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,630
safety really everything you've learned

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,500
about Internet safety applies okay we're

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,260
talking about

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,549
good password hygiene making sure that

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,500
you keep things private that are

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,850
supposed to be private keeping things

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,590
secret that are supposed to be secret

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,960
like your private keys and your mnemonic

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:30,299
phrase make sure you use unique

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,909
passwords make sure that you use you

00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,580
enable second factor authentication on

00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,399
accounts that support it so any

00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:42,210
exchanges you're using make sure you use

00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:45,029
those and turn on on all of those try

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,649
not to use SMS as your second factor or

00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,090
you get a message on your cell phone

00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:53,399
that has been shown to be vulnerable to

00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:57,630
exploits and in fact in the news this

00:21:53,399 --> 00:22:01,110
past summer criminals were apprehended

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:06,840
for playing the the social card and

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,190
doing the the sim swap thing you've

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,289
heard about that in Florida somebody

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,370
lost billions of dollars in crypto

00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:17,700
currency because AT&T allowed someone to

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,169
basically hijack II assume and they got

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,399
ahold of the second factor

00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:26,700
authentication codes and was able to get

00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:29,010
into his accounts and steal his

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,830
cryptocurrency so if you can use a

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:36,720
Google Authenticator another second

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:40,230
factor Google just recently made for

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,750
sale hardware devices that are little

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:46,049
Bluetooth dongles that that are your

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:49,880
second factor token and using a hardware

00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:52,620
key you can use that as a second factor

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,230
so just be aware that very often even

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,659
with all the technology the social

00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:01,500
aspect is very often where most people

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:07,500
are vulnerable so don't fall prey to

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,669
phishing phishing schemes or scams the

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,760
other thing we can do is keep our

00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,980
software up-to-date so make sure that

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,350
you keep your your OS patched with all

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,730
the security vulnerabilities use an

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,559
evergreen browser

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,950
so that every time you launch it you get

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,110
the latest version make sure all your

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,510
securities that are path security

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,429
patches are applied and make sure that

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,639
any of the extensions you have in your

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:36,360
browser don't have vulnerabilities those

00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:39,360
are sometimes not as obvious to check

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,159
and then if you let anyone else use your

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,039
computer where you do any crypto

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,450
currency transactions that's an

00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:53,789
additional risk that you have to be

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:55,860
aware of so so for some other obvious

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,549
things keep your mnemonic recovery.for a

00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,830
secret write it down by hand whatever

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,510
you do don't photograph it because when

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,970
it's on your phone guess what it gets

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,279
backed up to the cloud very often like

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,789
Google photos and if you forget and you

00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:16,019
have your your Google photos public

00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:18,149
you've just like your mnemonic phrase so

00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:21,539
store it carefully you do want to write

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:24,929
it down and store it in a secure fire

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:29,850
fireproof place or etching on the metal

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:32,639
like you like you've seen and you know

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,470
take the other precautions use use a

00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:40,740
good printer with good ink or a good pen

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:43,799
with good ink you can laminate it yeah

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,059
don't forget to test it also so before

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,889
you put any cryptocurrency on your

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,139
hardware wallet make sure that you can

00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:51,299
basically reset it from scratch and do

00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,299
it again using the recovery phrase you

00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:57,000
wrote down maybe you like didn't write

00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:00,120
down the word correctly or maybe you

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,340
can't read your handwriting make sure

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,320
you test the recovery phrase before you

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:10,710
actually put any money in those

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,990
addresses and then if you're really

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,630
concerned or you're in a high risk area

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,549
and networking wise you don't your

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,070
apartment complex you have shared Wi-Fi

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:24,480
you don't really have the ability to or

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:27,120
in your dorm maybe you want to use air

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,970
gapped Hardware you can disconnect from

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,649
Wi-Fi use my ether wallet locally

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,679
and I have a couple examples I'll show

00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:39,279
you how to do that you can create and

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,919
sign your transactions offline and then

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,399
reconnect and then take that signed

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:51,159
message and send it through the etherium

00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:53,519
network or a Bitcoin you can use USB and

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,080
brand-new flash memory that's never

00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,619
touched a computer that's been connected

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,389
to the Internet you can also use the

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:03,879
skills you may have learned it at work

00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:06,879
to do docker images and that sort of

00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:10,349
thing or virtual machines to sort of

00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:13,690
help create that air-gapped environment

00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:18,159
where you can do transactions securely

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:21,009
and safely if you use electron at work I

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:26,499
got an example to show you or you can

00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:28,059
just use local standalone HTML pages so

00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:33,070
let's look at some of these examples for

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:44,349
using docker with my ether wallet so

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:47,739
what I've done here is set up a it's

00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:52,269
already logging I've got a docker image

00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:59,009
that I generated and I called it my

00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:59,009
ether wallet offline mu offline I

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:09,609
basically took a simple docker file and

00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:13,239
put an HTML page in it that is the my

00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:16,299
ether wallet source so if I went to that

00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:18,849
one ether wallet page on the internet I

00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:23,549
would see the same page but this is the

00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:26,049
one that's running on my local you can

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:29,830
generate your own certificate you could

00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:31,659
use like let's encrypt org and configure

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,960
that so that you get a valid certificate

00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:38,440
for yourself and set it up so that it

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,159
Auto renews don't use my ether wallet if

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,140
you see this red not secure it's

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,600
probably a phishing site

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,150
and if you go here for the first time

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,670
and you see all the pop ups it's good

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,460
idea to leave read through them once you

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,880
can easily clear them just by clicking

00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:01,240
anywhere but every time it pops up you

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,340
get this all this disclaimer just to

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,500
scare you away from we know this

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,770
click-through stuff is annoying we're

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,770
sorry

00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,760
so I'm actually connected to my local

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:22,860
host which if you saw the logs that were

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:26,429
printing and I can view my wallet info

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:33,270
if I wanted to take that mnemonic phrase

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:37,240
that I had earlier we fire up a fake

00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:39,820
aetherium minor called ganache you can

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,520
use this to test smart contracts for

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:49,570
deployment I can take the mnemonic

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:54,250
that's here and I can paste it into my

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:57,220
ether wallet passphrase the password is

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,350
optional I just recently learned that if

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,230
you put a password in here I know that

00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:06,780
ledger and I think treasure Hardware

00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:09,419
wallets support entering this passphrase

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,400
it does change your wallet addresses

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:17,080
it's a completely different set of

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:20,890
addresses because the the master key

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:24,429
that gets generated is different when

00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:26,740
you do this on the ledger wallet it says

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:29,559
please wait while we reconfigured about

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:33,220
your device it is temporary so that

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,260
whenever you allow the wallet together

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:40,600
to go to sleep and you have to re-enter

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:46,179
your PIN to to open it it will be reset

00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:48,070
back to without a passphrase so you

00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:52,059
could use that side of the wallet for

00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:54,190
day to day simple small amounts of

00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:56,070
transactions but if you want to do

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,200
something more secure you can

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,840
put in a password here and you will have

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,690
to enter that temporary password to sort

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,119
of unlock those hidden addresses from

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:14,070
your hardware wallet but this is exactly

00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:16,919
the same so I can choose any of these

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:21,859
and I see the different addresses I

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:24,509
happen to be connected to the Rob stone

00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:27,239
aetherium network which is one of the

00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,399
test nets so this anything that would

00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:32,399
appear here wouldn't be real if there

00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:35,549
iam it'd be the fake stuff but you can

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,580
test with this so you can use this same

00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:43,049
address for Rob stone or main net a

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:45,269
theorem there are aetherium faucets that

00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:49,259
if you want to create a smart contract

00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:52,039
and deploy it to Rob stone you can play

00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:55,049
around with how that would work and

00:30:52,039 --> 00:31:00,450
create your own smart contract using

00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:03,479
solidity and test it with ganache so

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:07,409
you'll note that if you can remember I

00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:10,080
usually look at maybe the first three or

00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:14,009
four or five characters usually that's

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,840
different enough if I look at my ganache

00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:22,619
instance that's the same the same number

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:30,989
so I've confirmed that by choosing the

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:33,590
same VIP thirty-two path 44 prime 60

00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:37,679
prime 0 prime zero and account index of

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:43,259
this one is zero that this happens to

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:45,239
match that particular wallet and the

00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:49,379
rest should match as well because it

00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:56,729
starts at index zero and increases by

00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:59,820
one now if I were to choose a heart

00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:03,450
ledger as if I had a let ledger Hardware

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:06,269
wallet what's that and address zero is

00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,670
not the same it's basically the parent

00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:12,990
of

00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:15,330
this derivation where this has one extra

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:18,030
zero it's gone through the key

00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:25,470
derivation function one extra level and

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:28,980
past zero in is the value or the seed so

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:33,930
I can use this to create offline

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:38,570
transactions using this page access your

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,570
wallet generates the signed transaction

00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:47,070
or if I just want to send something

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:55,800
immediately I'm not too concerned about

00:32:47,070 --> 00:33:00,420
security I can unlock the wallet and

00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:04,200
choose which address to send from there

00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,420
isn't anything in there but put in the

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:14,330
destination address on the amount I want

00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:18,090
to send so let's look at the other

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,770
example of using electron-electron is

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,500
interesting because well there's a lot

00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:25,070
of projects that are written in electron

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,950
that you may have heard of es code atom

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,660
I think the ledger live software that

00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:34,050
you can use with your ledger Hardware

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,420
wallet is an electron based application

00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,820
they're just unknown a surprising number

00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,630
of applications that are based on

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:48,840
electron which is a originally I think a

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:50,340
github project that uses chromium inside

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,730
of it so there's basically a little

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:58,680
version of Chrome inside the the

00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:01,110
electron project and it uses nodejs

00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,690
type modules to basically create an

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:05,940
application suitable for the desktop but

00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,040
it's very portable because it's based on

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:13,350
Chrome so everywhere that chrome and

00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:17,210
nodejs run electron is able to run so

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,860
similar to this I took an electron basic

00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:26,350
starter application and I took the

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:30,700
VIP VIP 39 page from the github account

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:33,940
of Ian Coleman he has a VIP 39 a repo

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:36,670
there's an offline version you can copy

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:43,030
that into your electron project and run

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:47,800
it and the result of that is a mnemonic

00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:53,340
code converter so I can use my same VIP

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:56,710
39 mnemonic confirm that okay this is

00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:58,300
promising it has a seed I can look at

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,150
the entropy details sometimes this

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:09,730
doesn't display correctly thinks I have

00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:11,710
blank entropy 24 words and sometimes it

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,920
has displayed I really have to put the

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:17,530
entropy up here so that long has two

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,740
hexadecimal number that I said was the

00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,800
entropy that went down in two rows of

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,370
nibbles I put that value here and it

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,920
will repeat some of the information that

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:33,360
you saw earlier but it does give me my

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:37,810
word indexes which is the important part

00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:42,250
so if I hide the entropy details we can

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:43,420
look at the addresses and again it's

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,260
important that I choose the correct

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:51,820
point type so if I want to look at those

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:55,990
same aetherium addresses and then I have

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:58,900
to choose my derivation path so the AP

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,250
32 is sort of a free-form I could put in

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,180
kind of whatever I want

00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:07,330
the IP 44 kind of adheres to what I've

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,120
selected before it's the purpose type is

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:13,720
40 for the coin type is 16 because I

00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:18,160
chose aetherium from above and then it

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:22,300
also has the the ganache extra level

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:27,060
versus what like the ledger does but I

00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:30,790
can find my same cd70 be address here

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,599
along with the public key and then even

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,130
the private key

00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,520
and if I click on it it gives me the QR

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:42,539
codes if I can scan it but just beware

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,609
that the camera can it gives you a

00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:49,410
little warning caution the scanner may

00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:52,650
keep the history of what you scanned so

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:55,920
again there's four levels if I want to

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,770
look at Bitcoin what Bitcoin addresses

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:04,260
look like I can't even choose like a

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:11,640
Bitcoin Testament for example and the

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:14,309
test net it's slightly different the

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,309
test net there are node modules that lis

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,200
validate Bitcoin addresses so it can

00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:23,460
kind of tell you sorry you've pasted me

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,279
a an address for a test net and really

00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:30,950
what I need is the the main net address

00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:36,510
because they happen to start with a

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:39,359
limited number of prefixes so when you

00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,329
see these numbers hopefully you have a

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:47,160
better understanding now of what those

00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:48,359
exactly mean don't worry if you can't do

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,670
the math I still can't do the math

00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,809
either but at least I kind of have an

00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,809
understanding of what they mean

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,240
so by running this this electron app

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,160
locally I don't have to worry about

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,160
extensions that I might have that are

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,580
malicious because it's in a own special

00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,620
copy of electron and I can read I can

00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,630
rebuild it and make sure that you know

00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:20,830
it's I can run it locally when I

00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:24,550
generate my initial mnemonic phrase and

00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:26,320
then if you speak another language maybe

00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,250
you've got an emission additional level

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,810
of security because you can use

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:36,730
something that most people where you

00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:39,220
live doughnut doesn't understand so the

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:43,510
word phrases are based on these other

00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:46,660
these other values and it knows what the

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,930
word they are it's not the same meaning

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:53,070
in the word but the word net net index

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,070
matches that word list

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:05,259
all right so a couple things to wrap up

00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,109
it's okay to diversify you can use

00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:09,789
multiple multiple hardware wallets but

00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:12,130
you don't even have to buy multiple

00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:14,400
Hardware wallets either using the

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,170
passphrase or using different

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,650
initializations you can take advantage

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:24,039
of having different wallet addresses to

00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:28,509
keep your cryptocurrency diversified so

00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:30,160
it's not all in one one place or you can

00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:31,690
maintain assets on different wallet

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,250
types you didn't need to have

00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:38,049
necessarily have the same mnemonic

00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:44,309
phrase in everywhere that you use you

00:39:38,049 --> 00:39:48,690
can have multiple mnemonic phrases and

00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:51,519
then one thing to keep in mind as you

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:55,150
maintain your cryptocurrency assets over

00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:59,410
over years and years consider your

00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,910
survivor access for your heirs be sure

00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,980
to leave instructions on how to access

00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,069
especially you have a significant wealth

00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,650
in cryptocurrency you want to be able to

00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:13,180
pass that on to to those who who follow

00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,799
you leave instructions either with in a

00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,460
safe deposit box or an estate attorney

00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:21,940
or you know someone else that's trusted

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,859
and then just be sure to keep the

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,930
information updated as you change things

00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:28,809
you know as you stop using one

00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:30,880
particular wallet or you have a

00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,529
passphrase that gets leaked or you're

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,049
not sure if it's leaked and so you want

00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:37,660
to use something else update the

00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:44,380
information so that people can find what

00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:47,190
you have any questions these are the

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,539
contact info i'm on twitter at s swing

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,059
there's my github account although i

00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:55,779
don't have these particular projects

00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:59,079
there i may push them there soon today

00:40:55,779 --> 00:41:01,990
is the high o linux fest you just you've

00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:04,240
just been witness to that if you want to

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,609
find more more about substratum and what

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,950
we do there's our website and our

00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:12,150
Twitter account and

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:55,109
YouTube channel anybody have any

00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:57,329
questions um so the question is with the

00:41:55,109 --> 00:42:02,040
theft in Florida and the sim sim card

00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:05,369
swap was that person targeted I don't

00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,839
know is the short answer I mean if that

00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,940
person was like high-profile and

00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,890
bragging about how much cryptocurrency

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:15,299
they made or some deal then they may

00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:18,599
have sort of made themselves a target or

00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:20,700
information leaked I I don't know about

00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,690
that specific case that's some

00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,280
interesting to search and figure out so

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,880
that I guess the the moral of that story

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,260
is you don't have to like make yourself

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,260
a target if you don't want to

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,910
when it comes to security it's always at

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,800
odds with convenience so I think you

00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,570
have to decide with the amount of

00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,030
convenience you want versus the amount

00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:16,230
of security you want and it's completely

00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:20,220
up to you it does it is sort of

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:22,320
reassuring that if I generate a well if

00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:28,110
you have a choice it's good to use more

00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:33,660
entropy and so 24 words gives you the

00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:36,180
most entropy that VIP VIP 39 will

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,730
support so if I generate entropy and

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,760
show the details it does say that this

00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:44,190
amount of entropy takes centuries to

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,330
crack in terms of our current compute

00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:51,390
power and I still think that quantum

00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:55,410
computing is probably a ways off from

00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:58,680
actually being able to crack 256 bits of

00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:01,710
entropy we may eventually get there but

00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:10,140
and people are working on quantum

00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:12,410
resistant algorithms so does that answer

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,410
your question

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:52,880
yeah I mean I will say when it comes to

00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,950
purchasing hardware wallets make sure

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,470
you buy them from you know reputable

00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,890
source don't just grab any old one off

00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,890
eBay

00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:06,710
you know that's and and put a lot on it

00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:09,230
really you don't necessarily need a

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:13,040
hardware wallet when you've got software

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:15,619
tools like this VIP 39 mnemonic code

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,270
converter or things that you could

00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,340
basically do what the hardware while it

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,550
does the hardware while it just gives

00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,650
you sort of a convenience although if

00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,080
you do use that passphrase feature to

00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,400
enter temporary passwords it's kind of a

00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,619
pain because you basically have to

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,500
reenter the password every time you

00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:38,750
enter the pin to unlock it if you go

00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:41,200
into that mode so yeah any other

00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,200
questions

00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:49,400
does this convince anyone that

00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:52,820
cryptocurrency is too hard there's no

00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,900
way I want to do this at all that's not

00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:59,410
been into it well that's good - any

00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,410
other question

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:12,990
correct right so the hardware wallet

00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,700
the dew point Jets making is that the

00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,010
key never leaves the device your private

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,780
key so the data is that for the

00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,240
transaction is sent into the hardware

00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,490
wallet and the hardware wallet produces

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,300
a signed version of that transaction and

00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:30,450
so the software that reads it out is

00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:36,570
able to be sent securely without leaking

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:41,130
the private key at all so any other

00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:41,780
questions well thank you so much for

00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,980
coming

00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:48,010
hope you learned something

00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,010
