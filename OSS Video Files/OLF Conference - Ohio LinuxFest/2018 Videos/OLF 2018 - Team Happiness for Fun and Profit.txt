Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Employers woo developers with ping pong tables, free lunches, and beer taps. But it’s still rare for employees to stay in a job for more than five years. So what can we do to make our work life better, and reduce employee turnover? In this session we’ll talk about:
* Tips for self-care that I’ve found useful.
* What you can do to make your work more rewarding.
* Steps your company can take to reduce employee turnover.
* How to care for your team.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,380
so I want to talk to you about team

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,560
health and you know I joke only titled

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,300
this team health for fun and profit but

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,519
what really really drove drove me to

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,530
write this presentation is I've worked

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,100
on teams that we have good team health

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,010
and we can get so much done and you know

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,170
we deliver product rapidly the clients

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,689
always happy and I've worked on teams

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,490
that the team health isn't good we don't

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,830
have trust we can't communicate with

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,329
each other and you know what we deliver

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,610
not much during the times the team is

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,300
unhappy hour delivery tends to fall too

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,890
and so in another one given another talk

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,629
that I'm giving at 11:00 today it

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,190
occurred to me maybe we should spend

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,520
some time talking just about what makes

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,469
a team healthy and happy

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,879
because that really for me turned out to

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,829
be the thing that was the best metric

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,440
for am I going to deliver obviously I'm

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,239
clay Dowling I quit all so obviously

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,239
love sticking my name on all the things

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,630
my Twitter handle if anybody wants to

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,580
follow me on Twitter I will warn you

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,920
you'll hear less about technology and

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,689
coaching and more cat pictures this

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
slide deck is also available online if

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,790
you want it I will caution you for this

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,979
presentation in particular these slides

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,290
are mine mental cues for what I want to

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,180
talk about you can't take these slides

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,500
and share them with your co-workers and

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,640
expect them to get anything out of it

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,750
fortunately this is being recorded so if

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,240
you've got something out of what I'm

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,530
talking about today you can go to these

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,990
recordings just I'm assuming you're

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:46,259
gonna be available excellent that's both

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,780
really cool and really intimidating so

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,340
if I die up here you can share this with

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:59,969
your co-workers they don't do what this

00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:01,439
guy did okay so we work in an industry

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,229
where we're really privileged we get

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,210
lots of perks all in the name of

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,970
employee happiness and retention that

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,830
other people think are just crazy most

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,720
of my friends that don't work in tech

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,750
and all of my wife's friends they can't

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,090
believe that we have

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,220
taps in the office we have two rotating

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,880
taps we have a wine cooler we have a

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,040
chef

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,160
we have foosball tables and they're all

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,390
like well how do how do any work get

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,890
done you know don't spend your day

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:32,770
goofing off you know we've got all that

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,120
stuff and yet how many people here have

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,390
been in their current job for longer

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:43,300
than five years okay we've got a few

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:48,660
excellent how many people you have

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:51,310
co-workers or supervisors in the room

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,180
okay I've got a few you're gonna sit

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,820
this question out don't answer it's my

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,380
next question how many of you are

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,950
looking for other work open to new

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:07,770
opportunities that they should show up

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:11,440
okay so that's a problem that's if I'm

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:14,620
if I'm trying to run a company I need

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,810
people somebody has to do the work as

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,670
two people are always leaving who's

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,500
doing the work well the person doing the

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,690
work of somebody new who doesn't know

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,640
how you doesn't know how we operate

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,709
who's just learning that system and

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,780
we're constantly spending time starting

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,080
over and retraining incredibly expensive

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,790
to constantly be training new people and

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,030
also the work doesn't get done as fast

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:41,709
as it could if I had experienced people

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:43,810
so that's a problem so great we've got

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:51,190
all these employee get set up what we

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:53,410
don't have is people that stay so a

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,230
social networking application called

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,280
blind which specializes in anonymous

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,230
social networking for the technology

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,000
industry they did a survey of their

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,440
users their users reported 50 57 percent

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,690
of their users reported that they were

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,980
burned out you know they're going to

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,799
work because they've got bills to pay

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,269
kids to feed the bank wants their money

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,090
every month or the house goes back to

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:21,280
them banks by the way are very

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:22,870
unforgiving about this subject so you

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,190
know I'd say that might match the survey

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,900
results we saw in here a little over

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,900
half the people said hey I'm looking

00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:36,440
let's burn out the burn out is expensive

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,550
Harvard Business Review estimated I

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,780
don't remember exactly the year this is

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,780
from but it's within the last five years

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,120
125 million to 190 million in additional

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,300
medical expenses that I related to burn

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,150
out not not other expenses not workplace

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,590
injuries not everybody's having kids and

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,940
all my gas we've got to pay to have all

00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,640
these kids vaccinated and they're well

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,970
baby visits which is also expensive by

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,880
the way if you've ever seen those bills

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,890
you know this is expenses just related

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,360
to burnout and it could be simple things

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,860
like hey somebody had to go to the

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,540
emergency room cuz he can't feel his arm

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,280
but he's got carpal tunnel syndrome

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,420
because he's been working 60 hour weeks

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:22,650
for the last year all that stuff adds up

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:29,760
so we're losing money just because we're

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:31,530
burning people out so what can we do

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,440
about it or maybe more specifically the

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,190
question we want to ask is what kind of

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:43,410
pardon me I'll stop doing that that is a

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:45,990
reflexive gesture for me because the

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,310
first before we can change change the

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,490
place where we work we need to change

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,490
ourselves

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,110
if it was easy is making somebody else

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,660
change without a change in ourselves

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,040
you know consultant have a great job we

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,120
actually consultant could be out of work

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,440
because you could all just do this on

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,430
your own

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:08,970
so the first thing we have to do is

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:10,740
change ourselves and my semi mocking

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,270
model for this is the self-care is best

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,270
care and I'm teams that are healthy I've

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,040
noticed that everybody's really good at

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,510
self care if they take care of

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,640
themselves they're getting along better

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,260
with repeat with the people they're

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,290
working on the right things they're

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,460
delivering regularly and if they're not

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,960
taking care of themselves if they're

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,590
working crazy hours they work through

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,390
lunch they work over the weekend we

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,310
aren't delivering we're delivering that

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,720
well they're doing those crazy things

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,150
because we aren't delivering

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,200
which makes the problem worse so you

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,930
need to take care of your itself

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,490
physically you need to take care of your

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,970
mental health you need to deal with your

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,150
work

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,530
work-life balance may be one of the more

00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,910
important things do you have to do is

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,510
figure out what's really important to

00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,100
you I had the chance to look back

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,210
through the quick notes I wrote to

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,220
myself

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,240
six months ago when I first came up with

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,950
the idea for this talk and that was a

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,400
very fertile half those notes are what's

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:17,310
important to me why am i why am i

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,770
working at all you know I could I could

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,370
take a lower responsibility job work

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,350
part-time and still make a living if I

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,090
was smart about it you know I'm living

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,470
in a set in a Shack off the grid but if

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,430
that we had to take care of the things

00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,470
that were important to me I could do

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:39,240
that so for me just to give you an idea

00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,800
of the sort of things that might show up

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,260
on the list some of the things that are

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,360
from me important for me I need to be

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,310
able to take care of my family

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,350
which means for me keeping a roof over

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,190
the head being able to pay medical bills

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,990
we can go out to eat every now and then

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,970
it also means being able to take care of

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,750
my emotional responsibilities for my

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,919
family so if you've ever been in the

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,560
family you know there's a crisis

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,290
somewhere most of the time some sort of

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,240
crisis and so I need to be able to take

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:13,320
care of my wife's emotional needs to

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,280
when she needs emotional support when I

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,550
was going through some of my more

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,440
challenging work situations working for

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,520
my current employer pillar technology I

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,400
was I'm a hundred percent Travel job and

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:30,210
at the same time my mother-in-law was

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,620
dying just you get to be 80 this third

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,789
of things start to happen so something

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,990
that was really important for me and

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,940
which caused me to change my work

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,469
arrangements unfortunately I could stay

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,580
with the same company because we're

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,160
fairly flexible about our work

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,790
arrangements I needed to be there for my

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,860
wife flying from Ann Arbor to Des Moines

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,310
every week stop working for me during

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,760
that period of time

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,620
fortunately I was able to to change my

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,600
work arrangement so I could be home to

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,690
take care of my wife well she took care

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,310
of her mother things like that are

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,020
really important I'm sorry to bring this

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,390
down by the way I went from beer pong to

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,240
dying weather in Locke's

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,200
just realized what that was

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,180
but that was one of the things that got

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:23,130
me thinking about this that importance

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:26,310
of the work-life balance so sort of in

00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,630
the realm of mental health it pillar and

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,680
by the way we are hiring I don't mean

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,640
this to sound like a sales pitch for

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,400
pillar but we are hiring we didn't have

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,410
a policy of we work 40 hours we don't

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,080
work more than that we don't do nights

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,940
and weekends says the guy who's three

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:48,330
hours from his house and slept in a

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:51,750
hotel last night we don't we don't do

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:54,030
death marches because it's it's bad for

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,370
our brains you know you get tired you do

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,080
stupid things the code that you write

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,450
during the death marks probably gonna

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,830
cost your client money it's just gonna

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,540
be things wrong in there you're gonna

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,540
miss sales you're gonna screw stuff up

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,130
the last two the last two points on

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,230
there eat your lunch and not at your

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,700
desk those are something I saw struggle

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:21,960
with on my current team you need a

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,010
mental break in your day the idea that

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,230
you're gonna work eight hours straight

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,420
and be productive there

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,220
that's a nice fiction we tell ourselves

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,680
the reality is you know you're spending

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,730
the entire time at your desk you're

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,670
thinking about problems and you're

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,500
making decisions when you're hungry you

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,260
don't make good decisions you make

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,810
really bad decisions you walk out of

00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,070
Costco with you know two freezers full

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,070
of meat and you've got one freezer

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,090
we had this discussion at work yesterday

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,740
to some of my colleagues had made the

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,740
mistake I'm going to cast cost go hungry

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:04,040
so you know take that time to take care

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,880
of yourself take the break maybe we

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,880
won't take a nice walk

00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:19,850
the point is get up take care of your

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:20,990
mental health needs one moment one of my

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,160
colleagues thought it would be who knows

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:32,270
I'm presenting today thought it would be

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:33,680
funny to call me take care of your

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,940
physical health and I'm sorry I'm

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,890
walking completely out of frame you know

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,550
your body wants to move you will feel

00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,570
better if your body gets up a move even

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,770
if you have a physical disability

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:51,110
there's probably something you can do to

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,720
get some movement into your body we

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,339
think of this as a mental profession you

00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,390
know all the work we do is in our mind

00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:00,830
it's called I had a name for what we

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,660
call this but I don't remember what it

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:08,120
is but the even though we we use our

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,700
minds and do our work our mind has to be

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,730
carried around and fed by our body and

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,950
that means we need to take care of it so

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,460
you don't have to run a marathon if you

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,290
can't run a marathon power to you you're

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,470
probably not gonna this probably isn't a

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,940
subject area where you're having trouble

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,230
but find something physical that you can

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,790
do that you enjoy and go do that thing

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,140
this helps not just your met your

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,839
physical health but it's gonna help your

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,180
mental health too I personally love

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,200
hiking my wife and I recently took up

00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,700
nature photography and that's something

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,480
I had done for years but I got her to do

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,700
it with me too

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,040
and so now I've got even more incentive

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,750
to go and we're perfectly happy spending

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,959
eight hours hiking a difficult technical

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,580
trail you come back you know you come

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,690
back tired you're dirty you smell bad

00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,910
and you feel

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,990
great you feel like you know literally

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,300
you feel like you can climb them out

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,500
because you may just have done it I did

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,770
this at Michigan our mountains aren't

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,910
that tall if I was nice to you instead

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,260
of making a look at these blank white

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,610
slides I would have interspersed it with

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,090
pictures of the places that we went I'm

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,740
not that nice

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,830
the other thing to keep in mind your

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,710
work isn't your life if you're if you

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:36,170
find that your work is your life this is

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,980
a great opportunity and a wake up call

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,140
to get out and change that have

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,820
something you do outside of work and

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,340
I'll be honest I bring this up because I

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,690
was very guilty of this especially early

00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:55,190
in my career my late 20s when I first

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,020
started programming I would you know I

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,650
went to work I worked crazy hours I came

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,700
home I wrote more code at home inspired

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,200
by what I did it work

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,460
and that wasn't good for my brain

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,230
ultimately I wound up sitting in my

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:14,110
office with the lights off crying at

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:16,490
work not a good scene don't do it

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,790
haven't have an interest something that

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,560
you like to do outside of work have a

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,880
place to go that's away from work it

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,170
could be a club it can be a church

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,960
whatever it is just have this thing that

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,610
you do that's not at work maybe you like

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,880
to walk along the Olentangy River Trail

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,530
here when I travel for work and have to

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,500
stay in Columbus I try to do that at

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,330
least once a week if not every day I

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:45,710
love that trail even though occasionally

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:51,470
trucks do drive down it that was a very

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:53,290
alarming picture I saw last week you

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,850
know and speaking of work-life balance

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,839
go home every now and then make sure

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,089
your dog knows you lived there it can

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,390
really happen you're away so you're away

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,190
so much your animals kind of like I

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,850
don't know this person anymore he comes

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,850
around sometimes

00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,470
fortunately my animals all do know who I

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,470
am

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,829
and there's my mother-in-law could tell

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:27,930
you they will follow me around in a pack

00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:31,819
I have no dogs it turns out that we are

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:34,019
a cat family I love dogs but

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:39,740
lifestyle-wise dogs don't play well with

00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:42,769
our family we've tried it ends in tears

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,569
so we are a cat family but it turns out

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:49,170
a cat will follow your room just like a

00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:51,509
dog will my cat my cat likes me so much

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,639
he will he will walk away from a

00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:57,120
chipmunk that he's eating to rush out

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,970
and greet me in the driveway it's not a

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,139
pretty image we should never seen a cat

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,339
with a chipmunk they're pretty proud

00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:07,879
they're pretty happy about that chipmunk

00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,879
for him to walk away from it he likes me

00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:18,360
so before I move on to the next let me

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,279
see step back for just a second do we

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,610
have questions about how do you do the

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,279
self-care or what should you do about

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,589
self-care are these things that people

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:32,220
are doing now are you practicing good

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:34,589
self-care okay I get some nods a couple

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:38,459
of thumbs up okay how many gym

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,930
memberships in this room how many of you

00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,110
have seen the inside of your gym since

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:46,139
it was last painted okay I can't raise

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,579
my hand up for that one I was last there

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,720
in February and I've been several

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:58,170
notices about hey we're closed for

00:16:48,720 --> 00:17:00,360
renovation in this part all right I want

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,639
to talk a little bit now about you know

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,500
this talk is about team health so let's

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,740
move on to what we're gonna do for our

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,010
team the first thing to know we're

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:18,059
talking about team health I found the

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:21,240
hot spot is you that you yourself are a

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,649
leader and you might not think of

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,140
yourself as a leader you might be pretty

00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:29,200
low on the corporate total

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,730
but I have I have learned something

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,830
through just what I've lived through but

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,370
also what I have observed to some

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:39,640
co-workers you can be the new guy you

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:43,179
can still have a big impact your team's

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,590
health both positive and negative I have

00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:49,720
it I have a new team member who is

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:52,090
stressing my team currently I have also

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,590
seen people they were new to programming

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,029
they've been programming for less than a

00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:00,279
year we hired a guy right out of a boot

00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:02,140
camp young guy and he was the most

00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,500
wonderful thing for team health you know

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,580
we almost wanted to make him a mascot

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,870
turns out he wasn't having it and he's

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,270
now leading a development team for a

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:16,500
start-up but my point is you don't need

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:18,399
to you don't need a title you don't need

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,830
you don't need to be the senior person

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:24,190
on the team to act in a leadership

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,620
capacity for your team you personally

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,539
can influence people and get them to do

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,990
things that will make life better for

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,990
everybody

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,210
so last weekend my wife and I

00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,210
accidentally renewed our wedding vows

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:49,330
our church sent out a thing everybody

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,279
was having an anniversary on a five-year

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,409
mark they said another thing hey we have

00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,850
this nice dinner come to mass oh great

00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,770
we'll get a dinner we'll go to church

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,940
just apparently they want to see us

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,110
occasionally before they're gonna feed

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:06,520
us perfectly reasonable on their part

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,929
and we get the area the priest he's

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,159
talking about okay so now for the vow

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:16,179
renewal in him I wasn't dressed quite

00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:18,490
this nice it was an evening service it

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,260
was pretty casual normally pretty casual

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,740
I mean you know they've got guitars in

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,960
the band it's oh it's not not the big

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,539
formal thing I'm expecting on Sunday and

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:32,799
I show up like this to renew my wedding

00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:35,529
vows but something that struck me out of

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,340
there and of course anybody's been

00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,750
married to church

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,550
there's

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,520
reading from Paul's letter to the

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:48,300
Corinthians usually usually from first

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:50,010
Corinthians about love and into him that

00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,900
we close the mass with where we all you

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,670
know my wife and I go okay we can get

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,950
out and get fed now now that we've been

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,950
through this unexpected vow renewal

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,690
it was just line than the him from

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:09,300
actually the first line of the chapter

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:13,740
that that that quotes usually from that

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,710
if I speak without love no matter how

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,320
good my words are I really just allow

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,110
just a loud noise in the room I'm not

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,150
helping anybody and I'm not talking

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,500
about romantic love here although in the

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:30,600
context of a vow renewal that's

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,650
obviously what we meant and that him but

00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,850
just that love for your fellow co-worker

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,470
not the thing you have to you know you

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,600
have to declare on HR hey I'm dating

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,280
this person now so it goes in the HR

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,770
forms you don't wind up one of you

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,120
supervising the other but that instinct

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,480
inside of you that helps you look out

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,790
for the people you work with that makes

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,810
you want them to have a good experience

00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:59,460
at work that makes you feel not good if

00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:07,710
they aren't having a good experience at

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:09,420
work if they're having a hard time so is

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,360
if you approach what you're doing with

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,660
your team with that love even if you're

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,670
either that low person on the totem pole

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,920
you can really have an impact people can

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,170
you they can feel that when you're

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,580
talking to them that you care about what

00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:29,010
happens to them that will that will

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,780
improve your relations with them will

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:35,310
cause them to receive what you say is

00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,660
something that's you know valid

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,730
legitimate you're coming from an honest

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,190
place they will respond to you in the

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,440
same way they will give you feedback

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:46,080
from that place of caring that they care

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,120
about you that's going to make them see

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,600
you with a leader even if you don't have

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,600
the title

00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,830
so we're talking about team care this by

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,710
the way it's a part of this talk where

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,180
I'm really what's on the slide these are

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,100
talking points for me these are the

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,540
parts don't share this with you don't

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,420
share the slides with your coworkers

00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,010
without sharing this recording too or at

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,020
least bring back the high points that

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,380
you got out of this hopefully there are

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,670
high points you've got out of this

00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:21,220
hopefully the high point is yeah he uses

00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:25,300
get lab so you're talking to your

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,680
teammates we've got lots of things we

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,810
can talk about with our teammates we can

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,690
talk about team joy how we're

00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,450
communicating our team norms

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:36,160
accountability with each other when

00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,020
you're talking with them you don't

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,690
really want to live you don't want to

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:44,590
listen to respond you want to listen to

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:46,710
understand the difference the difference

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:50,080
when you're talk listening to understand

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,760
you may not respond at all your entire

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,400
response to them talking

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,530
could you just listening to what's

00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,400
bothering them or listening to what's

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:02,230
making them happy at work that is an

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,050
unbelievably valuable service you can

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,330
provide to the people that you work with

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,760
if you if you listen to them to

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,630
understand what's going on with them and

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,170
what their concerns are how many married

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:19,270
men in the room okay how many of you

00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,890
have had to learn that lesson about when

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:26,820
your wife brings a problem to you she's

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:32,080
not looking for you to solve the problem

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:33,490
she just wants you to listen for tone I

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,780
actually learned to that from my wife

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:43,080
before we were married it's a hard

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,080
lesson but take that lesson with you yes

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:59,840
yes that is correct for those who

00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:04,040
couldn't hear that we had some wonderful

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,900
marital advice here sometimes we are in

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,770
discussion with your spouse or your

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:12,110
spouse to be there's this thing called

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,690
yes dear you just sort of give a blanket

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:18,460
response and your wife can tell your

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,460
partner can tell they're not listening

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:26,840
so you can't what you need to understand

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,520
instead is that yes or no isn't

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,710
necessarily the right response sometimes

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,850
it's no response did I get that

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,290
correctly okay trying to because the

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:44,420
recording can't pick up the audience

00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:46,550
sometimes all right so when we're

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,800
talking to our teammates something we

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,320
have to be really really have to be

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,430
careful of there are some things we can

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,460
talk about openly you know I'm a big

00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,560
believer in retrospectives after every

00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,870
work iteration which we do a two-week

00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,520
iteration where I work we'd like to do a

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,400
retrospective with the team what went

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,010
well what didn't well go well what can

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,010
we change there are some things you can

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,140
talk about openly in there there are

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,960
other things you absolutely can't I

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,060
can't bring up it is stressing me the

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,230
heck out I don't want to work with Edie

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,360
you can't bring that up in that group

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,380
meeting you know that's gonna get mad

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,510
he's gonna get defensive

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,710
no good is gonna come out of this all

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,610
you're going to do is make it harder to

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,770
work with ed I bring it up but Ed's

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,020
actually a good guy it's probably gonna

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:44,150
watch these things his name was just the

00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:46,670
top of my mind um there are some things

00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,730
you have to talk about in private

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,160
because they're too personal they're too

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,440
hard to bring up in a group setting but

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,460
cause hard feelings maybe it's just

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,260
something that somebody doesn't want to

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,000
talk it's important to them but they

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,220
don't want to share it with a group but

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
they need to share it with somebody

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:09,260
um you know you may be having problems

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,370
at home I had a teammate his his wife

00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,309
left him right after they took

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,039
possession of their new house not

00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,620
something he wants to bring up in the

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,880
retrospective if you know but he does he

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,580
doesn't need to talk to somebody he

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,679
needs to talk to people say you know hey

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,090
I've got this thing that's going on my

00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,090
brain might not be here for a little bit

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,750
something that I I'd like to do or I try

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:40,280
to do I'm not good at doing it as I try

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,429
to talk with every person of my team

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,530
privately once every week or once every

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,720
iteration just to find out what's going

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,559
on with them what are the concerns that

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,730
they have that aren't being addressed

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,320
what are their high points that they

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,460
haven't gotten to share that maybe

00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:06,380
weren't appropriate to share with the

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:12,530
group let me see if I can safely move to

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:14,240
the next slide all right I could

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:18,650
probably even move past it do we have

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,960
questions about you know talking with

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,659
the teammates by the way we're we've got

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,429
20 minutes to go and I move Oh as I can

00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,860
see by my little bar at the bottom I'm

00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:32,150
75% of the way through the slides in the

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,799
last one is a thank you so feel free to

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,650
come at me with questions we've got the

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:39,940
time bring your questions up whenever

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,940
whenever they come to your mind

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,360
so something something that's really

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,440
important to bring up people don't

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,640
mention it when they're unhappy they're

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,280
having a bad time at work and they're

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,120
disgruntled they're burned out what 50%

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,380
of your teammates are thank you

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,870
apparently the lines a little more over

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:10,940
this way they're gonna bring that up you

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,559
know you don't walk into the team room

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,690
if you want a happy healthy team you

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,270
don't walk into the team room and say I

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,660
hate

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,250
job I want to leave usually if

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,200
somebody's doing that they're ready to

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:27,720
leave it's too late to heal the damage

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,430
so you want to talk to them are they

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,110
happy

00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:35,760
are there things about the job that are

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:40,290
that they're liking now but also are the

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,220
things that they don't like you really

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,540
want to find out about the things they

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,870
don't like because those are things you

00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,180
can take action on but they feel like

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,590
they're being heard and one of the

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,570
reasons for those one-on-one meetings

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:53,910
and these by the way they don't have to

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,520
be that formal scheduled one on one it

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,140
can be hey I'm gonna go out to lunch

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,430
with Ed and find out what's on his my

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,660
brain right now it can be Janis and I

00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,740
happen to be alone in the team room

00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:13,170
what's going on with her right now it

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,820
would be careful in these conversations

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,250
are they could be reasonably easy to

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,670
start up you know hey Janis what did you

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,020
you know what did you do last weekend

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,290
I'm probably gonna get pictures of

00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:31,260
whatever she did but it's an avenue to

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:33,510
open conversation you can use those

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,270
things they share to sort of dig deeper

00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:40,050
about what's going on what's going on

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,280
with them but ask asking if they're

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,050
being heard if they've got concerns

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,880
they've raised and they feel like well

00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:48,450
nothing's happened you know I came to

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,770
you two weeks ago about this process

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,370
that we've got to do is wasting my time

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,690
and that delivering value and nothing's

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,570
happened about it I haven't heard I

00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:01,260
heard anything back you know make sure

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:05,330
you ask about those things out of

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,330
comments from over here I'm sorry okay

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:18,210
hi this is Ann let me see if I can

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:21,150
safely extract this well I want what I

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,850
want your question to be on the record

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,960
because I'm gonna I may respond to it

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:32,309
and nobody's gonna know what I'm talking

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:37,450
about where I was working it was we do a

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:40,960
a team evaluation or feedback once a

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:46,900
year what is good here what is bad about

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,250
here on the scale of one-to-five that

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,159
kind of thing

00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:55,450
one of the things the impacts are they

00:30:51,159 --> 00:31:01,480
being heard for five years the number

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:05,740
one issue was the same thing and every

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:10,240
year management left it off of the list

00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:14,110
of things we're going to address finally

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,470
six years later together than the list

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,980
of things that you want to address and

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:26,799
solicited feedback from people about how

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:29,530
to fix the problem it was Jets you can

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:34,030
tell people you know you're listening

00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:36,039
and most companies do but they can tell

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:48,330
if you're listening from the fact of

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:48,330
what happens after ok every now and then

00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,049
can I ask what the five-year issue was

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,460
the five-year issue had to do with a

00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:15,970
time reporting application they had it

00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:18,190
was you will enter your hours for the

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:22,120
purpose of tracking the time you worked

00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,950
on the project great but you will also

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,649
enter your hours for the purpose of

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:32,049
billing overtime to the projects and

00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:36,019
allocating funds for the projects

00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:40,279
those are two different things they're

00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:45,649
asking to be reported on with one piece

00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:50,210
of data and the pushback from project

00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:55,730
managers on the allocation of funds for

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:58,190
projects was unbelievable yeah they

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,460
wanted to track ours everybody was on

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:04,999
salary so it was not a case of you know

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,649
tracking you know paid time or whatnot

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:08,840
it was just we want to know how long

00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:10,580
people are working here but because of

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,590
the fund allocation part of it

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,929
you got a push from the manager saying

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:19,279
you know okay you can't put in time

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:25,369
listing what you're actually working on

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:39,259
this project all right thanks for that

00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:40,549
feedback so that actually brings up

00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:41,600
something I was gonna talk about a

00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:44,239
little later but it's great to talk

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,879
about right now one of the best things

00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:49,279
you can do for team health is hold each

00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:51,200
other accountable that is how you

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,600
demonstrate that somebody's being heard

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,429
if you are holding them accountable and

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,499
if they are being accountable for the

00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,690
things they said they do so yeah

00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:02,299
everybody says hey this this app doesn't

00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,779
work for the purpose we're trying to to

00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:06,919
use it

00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:08,960
could we get a new procedure if they're

00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,530
ignoring that that sends a message it

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,119
leads to disgruntlement

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:17,690
you can make everything a lot happier if

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,879
when you hear that you take action or if

00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,369
you just up front say yeah I understand

00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:24,049
the problem unfortunately we have other

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:25,220
things we have to solve right now so

00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:27,500
we'll have to put that on the back

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,750
burner that is a form of feedback it's

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,760
not what you wanted to hear but at least

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,799
you understand okay they know what's

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,450
wrong they understand the pain I'm

00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:43,899
feeling and hopefully we'll get to a

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,899
