Title: OLF 2018 - What’s so Cool About BlockChain?
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	The recent interest in all digital currencies such as Bit Coin has also brought with it the “BlockChain” technology as a way of tracking who owns each coin. In this talk, we’ll attempt to explain the value of BlockChain for the “average” IT person. How it works. Some of the less known challenges to using BlockChain. And finally, some practical real-world applications that might help show where block chain could improve your business or process?

good afternoon my name is Scott Grimes

00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,309
and I'm here to talk to you about the

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,700
blockchain technology because I am

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,320
persuaded that the blockchain technology

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,949
is going to be involved in every one of

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,650
your futures in some form or fashion in

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,260
the very near future so thanks for

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,760
coming to my talk and hopefully we're

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,619
gonna get you a little more comfortable

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,289
with what the technology is and what it

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,439
does and then some real-world

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,110
application potential examples to help

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,820
you see how you could connect it as well

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,309
as unusually when you're talking about a

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,840
new cool technology not many of them

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,309
talked about the limitations or

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,760
disadvantages but we're actually going

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,270
to talk about some of the limitations or

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,039
disadvantages of the blockchain

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,190
technology because I want you to have a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,629
complete breadth an understanding of its

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,840
strengths as well as some of its

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,420
weaknesses and challenges so a little

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,239
bit about me I've been in the IT space

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,699
for over 25 years I am currently a

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,070
senior systems administrator and devops

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,920
with a small little known name company

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:12,450
called IBM and we have a brand called IX

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,340
and the IX division of IBM is helping

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,770
businesses with their digital journey

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,710
and especially their user two computer

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,380
interface experience so not only does IX

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,970
do websites but we're helping businesses

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,869
with their applications on their

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,860
androids their iPhones virtual reality

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,500
artificial intelligence all of those

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,320
things are being used to improve the

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,659
user to human experience played a number

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,520
of roles and I've been attending Linux

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,750
fest for about the last 12 of the 16

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,240
years that we've been here a little

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,159
housekeeping appreciate if you'll

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,649
overlook some technical details if

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,409
you're very savvy on blockchain I may

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,270
not have everything exactly right

00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,740
imperfect but I'm trying to help us just

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,240
take the cookies and put them on the

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,159
lowest shelf and give everybody a little

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,890
better understanding so not everything

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,710
may be perfect I will talk to the slides

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,140
but I will not read them verbatim there

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,869
is more content on these slides and I

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,190
have time to cover so my expectation is

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,140
you will be looking at the slides

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,560
glean and understand as much as I have

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,210
written up there while I am continuing

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,940
to try to sew this together in a

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,830
cohesive story an explanation okay and

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,690
then finally I do ask that we hold

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,060
questions and comments to the end I will

00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,650
do my best to leave time for them but I

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,960
want to make sure that I have something

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,370
of a nugget for everybody to take away

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,930
and in order to do that I need to get

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,630
all the way through the talk so that

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,310
everybody has something applicable that

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,830
they felt like they learned and was

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,040
useful today so questions and comments

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:47,710
I'll leave time now I want to make sure

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,560
we all understand blockchain does not

00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:56,530
equal Bitcoin Bitcoin uses blockchain

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,950
Bitcoin made blockchain very popular but

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,740
the blockchain technology itself has far

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,070
greater implications and opportunities

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,310
than just Bitcoin so you've seen what

00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,140
Bitcoin has done in the last 12 years

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,540
imagine that for multiple industries

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,340
that's how pervasive I think this

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,320
technology has the potential to

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,010
transform our current business processes

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,360
so as I said a little bit ago I'm trying

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,950
to give you an overview I'm trying to

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,620
take you from a high level understanding

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,200
to it's a word that I've heard and it's

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,030
very popular to a better understanding

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,280
of how the technology is implemented and

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,959
what it's really trying to accomplish

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,440
then let's talk some real-world examples

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,360
and then finally some limitations so in

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,860
order to build that bridge I thought I

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,010
would actually start with a real-world

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,620
physical example and then tie that to

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,400
our digital technology space several

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,519
years ago I had a need to transfer an

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,420
asset of significant value and heritage

00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,220
across the country to somebody else I

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,519
didn't have the time or resources to

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,760
drive it there myself but I found out

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,280
that the US Postal Service offers a

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,660
service offering that you can pop that

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,140
you can pay for that every time that

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,419
package changes hands the guy that's

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,789
giving it has to sign off and the guy

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,290
that's receiving it has to sign off that

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,480
I

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,640
took ownership responsibility and

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,150
accountability for this particular

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,270
package and that package was stored in a

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,580
digital ledger such that if the package

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,640
did not arrive at the destination and

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,230
get signed off by the destination user

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,900
we're going to the last guy in the list

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,510
and say you took ownership and

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,140
responsibility for it this is your

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,670
signature on this date where is it you

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,970
need to come up with it so it's a very

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:57,750
strong hightened so really what the

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:01,590
Postal Service had was a ledger as well

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:05,310
as an audit trail of that package okay

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,910
now that's blockchain at a physical

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,910
concept level what could we do digitally

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,270
in our computer science II technology to

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,060
take this concept and enhance it with

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,000
our computer technology to make it even

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,310
more authoritative and valuable and

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,760
trustworthy and useful in our

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,310
technological space well number one if

00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,540
we wrapped it in some cryptic ography

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,400
goo then we could demonstrate integrity

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,210
we could show that the transaction and

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,880
the characteristics in that transaction

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,130
absolutely haven't changed this is what

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,830
the user signed off on this is what they

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,650
agreed to and computer mathematically

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:54,270
wise we know it hasn't been modified or

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:57,060
altered since then number two we could

00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,400
add some computer science goo to it to

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,850
give it immutability and create this

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,360
audit trail transaction record that

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,060
shows that over time this is exactly

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,880
what happened to the asset that was in

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,830
the blocks of the chain and that it

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,660
hasn't been modified over time there's

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,510
no way it could have been faked forged

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,930
stolen altered over time as those

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,430
transactions are linked linked and then

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,980
number three just a couple of more

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,010
pieces and we could take this audit

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,440
trail this ledger and database size it

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,650
and make it a distributed database so

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,830
that we have more than one copy so that

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,320
any attempt to alter

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,390
one copy or destroy one copy does not

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,200
actually disintegrate the whole record

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,760
and so we could distribute our

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,800
blockchain database all over the world

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,300
and give it a distributed capacity for

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,210
availability redundancy parallel

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,430
processing etc and then finally if in

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,620
this record whatever we came up with for

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,730
this transaction and what we put in this

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,000
transaction if we had some standardised

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:08,530
agreement that this is a very useful

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,510
everybody agrees these are key elements

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,240
and we can alter pieces inside those key

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,680
elements transaction in a very

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,200
standardized way then we could teach the

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,900
computer how to do these transactions

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,700
far faster and more efficiently than we

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,950
do them manually today but if we could

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,320
standardize the format and if we

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,010
accomplish those first four objectives

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,010
in our technology then of course we pick

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,260
up some other business advantages one of

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,360
those is that we can now do transactions

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,920
much more quickly because the

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,930
verification the reconciliation the

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,730
clearance is actually stored in the

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,490
digital record we made that as part of

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,520
the transaction so today when you go to

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,280
sell a house you involve a third party

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,560
title company that title company goes

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,510
through some type of verification and

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,100
clearance and make sure that there

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,780
aren't any liens on the house that the

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,000
guy that's selling it really owns it and

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,890
has authority to sell it the guy buying

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,570
it really has the finances and funding

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,310
to buy they do all of that background

00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,590
check and verification and they put

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,890
their stamp of approval on this is a

00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:15,490
valid transaction transfer of asset that

00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,920
all functionality could be buried in the

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,370
record and be done by the computer much

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,900
much more quickly and obviously if you

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,600
bury it in the computer and teach the

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,790
computer how to do this then we can do a

00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,550
whole lot more of them and we can do

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,260
them at less cost and that really starts

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,810
to get businesses jive because I'm not

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,700
only am i picking up speed but I'm also

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,050
reducing costs and those are the kinds

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,510
of things that businesses say I want to

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,790
leverage and use this technology so that

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,790
is the goal sorry

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,699
that is the goal and desire of what

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,069
blockchain is trying to accomplish now

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,690
let's look at what that looks like

00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:04,089
technologically let's take an individual

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,279
blockchain block of course it's going to

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,230
hash have a hash at the beginning it

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,300
that's going to accomplish two things

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,279
one it's going to give us a link back to

00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,190
the previous record so that we can tie

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,990
all of these transactions that represent

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,550
an asset and what happened to that asset

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,720
who ant owned it who took responsibility

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,930
for it whatever

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,930
across the individual blocks number two

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:28,540
that hashes a unique value of what the

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,730
previous transaction was so there's no

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:34,240
way somebody could change the previous

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,339
transaction and take a hash without

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,959
altering or requiring a new hash but the

00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,670
hash is stored in the next transaction

00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,110
they can't get to the next transaction

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,490
without having to change the next

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,709
transaction without having to change the

00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,370
next transaction and so it gives us an

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,779
immutability attribute to the record

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,880
okay we're gonna of course have a

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:53,920
timestamp then we're gonna have a field

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,850
in there called a nonce now a nonce is

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,290
just a unique value long value that

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,040
gives uniqueness to the whole

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,800
transaction if there were by chance some

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,529
way the two transactions came in at

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,699
exactly the taem same style timestamp

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:15,130
and had exactly the same data the nonce

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:17,829
would ensure that they hatch two

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,740
different values so it gives us the

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,540
capacity for discouraging fakeri forgery

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,189
or replay because this nonce and this

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,750
unique value is neke to this transaction

00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:28,389
which is going to cause unique hash and

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,649
there's no way for a duplicate copy that

00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,870
looks very very similar to the

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,819
transaction all right then we get down

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,529
to the merkel root hash this is where we

00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:37,990
would actually store or attributes

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:41,220
elements or characteristics of the

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,779
transaction that we are trying to record

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,579
unique characteristics and we store them

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,579
in what's called a merkel root hash

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,360
because the merkel root hash algorithms

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:58,120
create demonstratable consistency that

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,910
what was stored in the record has

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,220
changed they're like checksums we use

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,750
merkel root hashes on file systems so

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,750
that when we read and write files off of

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,730
a file system what we can verify what

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,500
was written is also what was read and it

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,050
hasn't been changed or altered while it

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,630
was stored in state so that's a Merkel

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,180
root hash it's guaranteeing the validity

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,370
of the data itself and then then we'll

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,850
take this whole set of it attributes or

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,730
function in the what do you call data

00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,860
structure and will hash them and store

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,720
that hash with the record and then we

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,970
can start scrabbling the signatures on

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,550
it and the signatures or the transaction

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,800
list will have this the sender or the

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,470
seller the receiver and the recipient a

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,690
trend probably a transaction ID terms

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,940
all of that information about that

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,830
transaction and who agreed to the

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,390
transfer and on what basis they agree to

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,940
the transfer is stored in the

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,730
transaction list and that makes up a

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,400
digital record block okay or a data

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,339
structure now at first glance it looks

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,779
very computer ease and very comfortable

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,360
to you guys because you work with data

00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,670
structures all the time but very scary

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,080
to most of the world and what you need

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,060
to do is help them understand you know

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,589
what this really ain't that much

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,000
different than what you are very

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:18,730
comfortable with in a business process

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,640
you use every day and that is the credit

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,470
card receipt okay and if you can

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,000
actually help them see that you know

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,860
what we've got attributes that we're

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,920
keeping track - we've got senders and

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,480
receivers and sign offs in this this

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,750
receipt and we're just taking all of

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,870
that and digitizing it and adding some

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,880
computer science goo they all go oh okay

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,709
I can relate this ain't that big a deal

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,500
and that much difference so really all

00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:47,500
the block is in a blockchain is a

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,810
digital receipt with the computer

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,670
science goo okay well now that I have a

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,110
digital receipt format it's a

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,560
standardized format we all can agree

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,990
with it I could link them up and I could

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,550
demonstrate transfer of ownership and

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,580
responsibility accountability of

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,250
whatever that asset is in each block

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,960
that I'm tracking this guy owned it and

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,810
then they sold it to this guy who sold

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,430
- this girl who sold it - yeah or this

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,890
business and business and business all

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,440
of that is trackable and because I'm

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:20,440
taking a hash of this transaction and

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,620
I'm storing it in the next block there's

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,020
a link and there's an immutability that

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,850
I can't change this transaction or alter

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,350
what was really done because that would

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,510
force a different hash that would be

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,060
different than this hash and if they did

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,580
that I could demonstrate mathematically

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,740
in computer programming that hey

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,590
somebody altered the data stream and

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,510
what I'm trying to sell isn't is wrong

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,250
somewhere back in the track and we've

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,290
got to go figure that out and that's

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,390
exactly what is demonstrated here and

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,300
that before every new transaction is

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,220
added a complete verification walk back

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,950
through all of the transactions that

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,160
make up that asset are done and as I'm

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,720
walking backward through the chain

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,600
validating each of the hashes if I hit

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,310
one where hey somebody changed the data

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,050
here and it caused the new hash and it

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,810
doesn't match this hash that I have in

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,390
the next transaction there's a reason to

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,550
no longer trust the transactional chain

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,560
and we've got to get people involved to

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,130
find out who changed it or how did it

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,830
change or why but the the transaction

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,060
history is no longer trustworthy and we

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,920
shouldn't be continuing to build

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,870
transfer of assets upon the transaction

00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,620
history so that's the beauty of the

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,510
chaining of the technology ok now let's

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,830
talk about a use case hey now that I

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,080
understand how this would work

00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:41,970
what's a possible opportunity where I

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:46,180
could use this to improve accountability

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,550
Authority trustworthiness integrity with

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,080
the blockchain protocol well health care

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,730
is a big deal where we want to know that

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,410
the records right and that all the

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,690
people that touch me in my health care

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,640
have some heightened level of

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,790
accountability so let's take a

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,980
hypothetical scenario okay this is just

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,010
something that I created to help

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,290
demonstrate the value let's say this is

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,110
you actually this is my daughter and

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,490
you're having a bad day and there's some

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,100
things going on and you go to your

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:17,650
doctor doctor and you discuss it and he

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,120
writes you a script you take that script

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,650
to your physician

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sorry not your physician your

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,930
pharmacist okay this is my son and your

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,350
pharmacist says hey I'd be glad to fill

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,150
that for you but on this particular day

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,210
your pharmacist is having a rather rough

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:36,940
day he's had an awful lot of things come

00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,950
into him a lot of balls to juggle at the

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,810
same time in addition he's got some

00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,029
personal things going on and it's got

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,850
his mind distracted and he makes a

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,070
mistake he fills your prescription but

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,779
he gives you the wrong stuff and he

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,310
doesn't finish doing the background

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,690
check to make sure that it doesn't have

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,850
any reactions with any other drugs

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,250
you're taking but he gives it to you and

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,080
you take it home now he correctly

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,260
records it in the record what he gave

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,760
you but he didn't finish his homework

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,250
you take it home and in about four hours

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,070
later you're having real chest pains I

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,660
mean bad something's not right here you

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,730
wind up calling an ambulance

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,400
you wind up going to the EMR they do

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,839
some checking and find out that you the

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,850
biggest change that happened in the last

00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:20,500
few hours is you started on a new drug

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,910
they look at that drug and find out it's

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,470
conflicting with another drug that

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,970
you're having and they're going why did

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,260
the pharmacist even give you that drug

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,330
and we got some questions for the

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,310
pharmacist they're gonna go back and the

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,200
pharmacist finds out about this goes

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,839
back into the record that he has and

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,209
finds out that indeed he screwed up and

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,880
let's just say hypothetically for this

00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:43,810
situation he's looking at some prison

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,220
time okay and so he's like how do I

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,980
cover my tracks

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,740
how do I get out of this this could this

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,839
is really gonna ruin me and my career

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,209
and all my plans and future and all of

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,660
that so he's looking for an opportunity

00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:02,850
to change the record well he knows if he

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,770
goes in through the front door that

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,429
that's a HIPAA compliant application and

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,470
in HIPAA compliant applications

00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:13,959
everything is recorded every time you

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,750
pull up a record to look at it they

00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,720
record it every add change delete

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,880
modification I mean whatever it is hip

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,069
is creating that audit trail so there's

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,839
no possible way he's going through the

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,179
front door to fix that record that's

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,300
that I was demonstrating he screwed up

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:36,290
but this particular case our pharmacist

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,120
is good friends with the BBA okay now in

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,000
a casual lunch conversation between

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,410
pharmacist and DBA the DBA just casually

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,970
mentions well yeah through the front

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,610
door it's all audited and tracking but

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:50,000
you can but on the back side we store

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:52,580
all of those records just XML in a

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,260
database because we need the efficiency

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,520
and speed to do that we couldn't put in

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,660
any of their overhead on it so our

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,220
farmers that gives our pharmacist friend

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,920
an idea I've got a condo on the beach

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,400
that I get for two weeks every year my

00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,770
DBA friend loves the beach and so he

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,470
goes to his DBA friend and says hey I

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,600
got a small favor of ask if you only

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,190
take you five minutes if you would go in

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,800
and find this record and make this

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,140
change to this record I will give you my

00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,660
beach house on your favorite beach in

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,340
South Carolina for two weeks and a

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,220
thousand dollars you can take your whole

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,290
family have a great vacation our DBA

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,330
friend says you know what I'm on the

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,430
backside nobody understands what I do

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,500
nobody really values me I haven't had a

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,450
pay increase for three years this would

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,100
be a great opportunity for me and my

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:46,400
family to really enjoy something and

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,590
it's five minutes worth of work pretty

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,260
tempting offer so our greeby a friend

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:55,850
agrees he goes into the record and he

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,620
makes the modification and he goes into

00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,870
the record he makes the modification and

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,670
change after hours of course only takes

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,010
him five or ten minutes to find it and

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:07,100
sends an email to his pharmacist friend

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,780
and all it says is it's done pharmacist

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,400
friend comes in the next morning sees

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,350
the email goes into the HIPAA

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,780
application front door sees that it's

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,820
been changed and it correctly reflects

00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,800
that he did things right they're gonna

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,380
have to look elsewhere to find out what

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,660
happened and so our pharmacists friend

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:27,380
is doing the happy dance because tracks

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,090
are covered okay and the only two things

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,490
he's got to deal with now or his

00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,930
conscience and when he dies and has to

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,680
give an account to God for what he's

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,710
done how could we have used blockchain

00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,510
technology to enhance this application

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,210
and print event or discourage this

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:48,550
scenario from happening well the actual

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,410
XML document is really just a digital

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,250
form of a paper form that we're all

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,980
familiar with

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,450
it's got field names and it's got data

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,310
values in those field names and

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,530
typically stored in sequel database well

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,080
what if we actually took that XML

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,540
document and stored it in our blockchain

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,940
database and wrapped it with our digital

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,030
signatures and our merkel root hashes

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,760
and our-our hashes on the block then we

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,700
could demonstrate that what they signed

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,830
off on hasn't changed it's absolutely

00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,470
authoritative and trustworthy there's

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,350
one small challenge if you were to

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,350
actually do this implementation directly

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,650
and that is that the blockchain database

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,870
is not optimized for XML document

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,540
records which can be literally megabytes

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:38,350
in size you would very very quickly

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,670
bloat the chain and and processing time

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,710
go to go way way up for you to actually

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,780
complete these transactions plus you're

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,610
asking us to take your HIPAA application

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,870
and swap the database for the sequel

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,540
database for another database

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,540
architecture design that it's not really

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,580
designed for but if we could take that

00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,830
XML document and agree on some

00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,350
attributes that create uniqueness such

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,320
as taking an md5 sum of that XML

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:08,080
document as well as the doc ID and just

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,540
store those couple of characteristics in

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,580
the blockchain database then we could do

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,100
the digital sign offs and signatures

00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,020
addition and we could still store our

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,490
XML document in the sequel database

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,470
that's optimized for that kind of

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,140
content we're really just extending the

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,280
application we're not rewriting it okay

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,770
we're just adding an additional

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,330
functionality and capability such that

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,580
every time that we read that document

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,680
out of the database we would take the

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,920
transaction ID to go back into the

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:39,190
blockchain and do the md5 sum matches

00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,380
the md5 sum matches the hash hey data

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,270
hasn't changed it's good okay trust it

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,520
keep going forward kinds of

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,770
verifications and we've just extended

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,690
our HIPAA application and added

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,360
blockchain such that there is no way

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,220
somebody even on the backend side could

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,640
modify the transaction history of

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,610
everybody that touched that record and

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,179
demonstrate a heightened level

00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,580
of authority accountability trust and

00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,299
integrity to our HIPAA compliant

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,910
application

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,230
now our HIPAA compliant application is

00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,730
better than everybody else's HIPAA

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,000
compliant application because we've got

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,000
blockchain all right well if we can do

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,679
this for XML document database kind of a

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,809
quotations to increase it what other

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,780
opportunities are there you're all

00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,470
familiar with Bitcoin Bitcoin is just a

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,450
number

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,120
there's a certain number of them that

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,190
can be minted or mind using a very

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,630
complex algorithm that takes a

00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,330
significant amount of commute time

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,630
compute time but every time that someone

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,880
does find one they can submit this

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,980
unique number with a signature and

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,750
transaction that says I'm the miner I'm

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,160
the owner of this Bitcoin and I don't

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,710
think anybody else has come up with it

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,990
the blockchain technology could use

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,690
their algorithms and processes to verify

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,280
that nobody else has that Bitcoin this

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,919
is the first time that we've seen it and

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,750
indeed he or she is the owner and so

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,660
they would record it as such in the

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:08,460
database now that individual could turn

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:10,980
around and sell that Bitcoin or portions

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,410
of that Bitcoin for other assets or

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,280
services where the other entities agree

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:19,470
to take this as a financial value or

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,690
demonstration and so the financial

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,690
industry is going crazy over the

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,790
potential that a blockchain would bring

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,559
to allow them to much more quickly

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,770
transfer assets and ownership and

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,299
responsibility and accountability

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,160
because of this technology and what it

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:38,309
brings to the table are there other

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:41,100
opportunities for digital content I

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,309
think the music industry or the media

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,429
the multimedia digital industry is right

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:50,610
for advantages of blockchain let's say

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:53,160
that Twyla creates a new song Twyla

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,620
masters that song and a digital version

00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,210
and she's got something that she can now

00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:01,160
sell and market that everybody wants to

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:04,770
hear if - aya Twyla had the capacity to

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,890
take that master and make a copy of it

00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,870
and put some kind of uniqueness in that

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,520
copy that could not be altered or

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,330
modified but with it's jamming straight

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,450
that that copy

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,100
was a unique copy she could do the same

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,019
thing as we did in Bitcoin

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,600
submit it to the blockchain database and

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,820
say I am the owner of this song the

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,320
blockchain database would validate that

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,029
we don't have any other versions of that

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,880
song this is new

00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:32,070
she's the owner and copy responsible for

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,559
it and so they'll give her rights in the

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,470
blockchain databases owner initial

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,000
submitter of that song now Twyla could

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,549
take that song and turn around and sell

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,039
it to me and I would do a transfer of

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:47,610
asset and she would give me ownership of

00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,230
that copy of that song and the

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,190
blockchain record would show that I did

00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,250
a transfer of asset and now have less

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,110
money more song then I could enjoy it

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:02,220
for six months and I could turn around

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:04,679
and resell that copy of that song to Ray

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,120
and Ray would enjoy it for two or three

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,519
months and then Ray could turn around

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,919
and sell it to Ted and the blockchain

00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,370
record would demonstrate authoritative

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,019
Lee who has that song who made

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,899
legitimate copy and rights and of course

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,279
if we can do the positive and

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:22,980
demonstrate authoritative Lee transfer

00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,730
of asset digital asset we could also

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,070
possibly identify where people who have

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,010
copies that they shouldn't have because

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:36,090
if we find the version of that song on a

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:38,880
shared database website we could go into

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,740
the digital record and say who really

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,309
has the rights to have that song up

00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,899
there on that shared website and if you

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,519
don't have the rights to have that song

00:25:45,899 --> 00:25:50,190
because you're not currently the owner

00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,370
of it you either can pace while us some

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,370
money

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,450
so the music industry is ripe for the

00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:05,359
opportunity that blockchain brings to

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,519
the table to allow our artists to have

00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,590
legitimate ownership and demonstratable

00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,009
getting something in retribution for

00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,039
their work their digital work and rights

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:19,899
well if I can do this for XML document

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,899
databases and Bitcoin and

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:32,790
hey well if in a particular industry you

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:36,480
could get all of the players in that

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:39,990
industry that care to agree that these

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,310
characteristics or attributes actually

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,840
uniquely identify that physical asset

00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:48,750
globally there's no possible way there

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,430
could be a second copy of that asset

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,460
this is unique and we all would

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:56,460
authoritative lis trust these attributes

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,950
represent that physical asset then you

00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,820
could take those attributes stuffed them

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,320
in the blockchain database and suddenly

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,810
tremendously speed up the rate at which

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,450
you're buying and selling those physical

00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:15,000
assets or trading them between

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:17,070
individuals and an authoritative ledger

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,920
that has an additional level of

00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,660
authority trust accountability security

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,300
all of those things that computer

00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,980
science brings in a trustworthy way well

00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,530
gee if I could do it for land parcels

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,520
are there other opportunities I think

00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,970
supply chain as another huge potential

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:39,270
opportunity where the blockchain

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:41,520
technology could absolutely demonstrate

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,240
authority and responsibility and

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,820
accountability

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,030
every time that asset moved or changed

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,090
hands through the supply chain process

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:54,540
of course the receiver would have to

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,210
validate that these are the attributes

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,550
of the asset that I took ownership of

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,340
and are unique so they would definitely

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:05,130
say yep that's the job that's the oil

00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,500
tanker and I peek inside and it's crude

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,470
oil and I waited and it's really that

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,780
many leaders and I'm now gonna say yes I

00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,850
took responsibility for that and I will

00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,110
sign off in the blockchain record that

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:20,190
so-and-so gave it to me and it's now my

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,980
responsibility accountability to pass on

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:27,020
to the next individual IBM is actually

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:30,060
using this supply chain model to help

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:32,430
blockchain digitize the diamond industry

00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,200
right now for this very reason and

00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,510
purpose because this is a pretty problem

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,000
and risk from diamonds getting to mine

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,600
from mines to

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,269
and so supply chain is a tremendous

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,909
potential to the use of blockchain to

00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,980
increase the level of authority trust

00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:51,470
integrity responsibility all of those

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,889
things beyond what we can do in our

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,450
business paper processes today now and

00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:59,330
all the examples that we've talked about

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,100
it's been a transfer of one asset to

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,500
another asset and it has only involved

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,779
one individual or a business to a

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,500
business but the actual blockchain

00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:10,879
protocol allows for the capacity for you

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,620
to say that you know what for this

00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:16,179
particular transaction

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:18,919
I need sign offs from multiple roles or

00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:21,649
individuals and this transaction can't

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,299
happen and be marked complete until I

00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:25,639
have an individual that took

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:28,519
responsibility for this role and all of

00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:31,100
them signed off on this transaction so

00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:33,649
that really opens up the possibilities

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,950
and scenarios and of course in addition

00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:40,399
to an and algorithm the blockchain

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,860
protocol also allows for an or protocol

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,820
any one of these individuals would be

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:54,580
legit for that role to sign off on this

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:57,440
transaction of transfer of asset ok

00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,779
that's just scratching the surface

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,639
hopefully in those categories it's

00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,620
beginning to get the juices flowing and

00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:05,720
the ideas bubbling of how you and your

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,730
different businesses could you know I

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,590
can see potential for this to enhance

00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,870
what we're doing today in an

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,090
authoritative and traceable way the

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,370
leading open source project for

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:19,879
blockchain is something called hyper

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:22,070
ledger much of the initial code that was

00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:25,789
written for hyper ledger was actually

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,649
written by IBM's masters and PhDs they

00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,990
saw this opportunity they saw the

00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:32,000
potential of this opportunity and they

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,769
wanted it to gain traction and get

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,440
authority and accountability so they

00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:39,559
wrote a good chunk of the code and then

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,799
submitted it to the hyper ledger project

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,000
as open source because they now want to

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,690
go out and help those businesses

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,240
implement

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,060
and transformed their business processes

00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,170
but they said we wanted to have

00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,870
trustworthiness and integrity so they've

00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,820
thought about all the edge cases and

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,860
what-if scenarios and other things and

00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,240
baked those into the code and then let

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,240
other people look at them because

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,990
they're trying to get a trustworthy

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,850
architecture that they really don't care

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,680
that they own the software but they

00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,830
certainly would value helping businesses

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,140
transform industries and processes using

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,880
block chains and then of course the

00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,550
cloud services are saying you know what

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,230
there's an opportunity here businesses

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,580
are gonna need a distributed database

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,320
that goes all over the world we've

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,460
already got the data centers already

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,380
over the world if we could figure out

00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,110
how to take blockchain and standardized

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,120
it and containerize it and give them the

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,090
capacity where they could just rent a

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,560
blockchain for a particular asset then

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,910
they wouldn't have to setup all that

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,280
infrastructure and architecture and

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:40,640
support it we do that for them and so

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,400
blockchain as a services is a happening

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,050
thing all right so hopefully I've gotten

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,180
you really jived and excited and you're

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,000
like ooh this is cool this could really

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,950
change the game again and you're like

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,360
yeah I'm going home I'm gonna just study

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,040
this some more I'm gonna figure out how

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,660
to apply this in my edge cases I'm gonna

00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,650
start talking to my users and get them

00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,880
excited with a go out listen to this

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:03,620
talk okay but we need to talk about some

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,400
of the limitations or challenges

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:08,810
blockchain is not perfect okay

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,360
blockchain because it is a chained

00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:13,160
technology and you've got to go before

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,900
you add a new transaction you've got to

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,030
go backwards and validate that all the

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,060
transactions in the chain are still

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,790
valid and authoritative that takes time

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:26,060
and the more times you transfer that

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,880
asset the longer that chain gets and the

00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,740
more time that it takes in order to do

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,320
all the validation now it's still much

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,050
much faster than humans but it's an

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:40,820
increasing linear time algorithm problem

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:43,640
okay and in addition to that you can't

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,490
just check one database you got to check

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,540
all of them because that transfer of

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,160
asset could have happened in another

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,750
database it hasn't gotten back to the

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,150
one that you're looking at so now I got

00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,370
to do a distributed search invalidation

00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,330
across all of the database and that

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,919
takes more time so by way of example

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,480
in September I when I was putting these

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,789
together I went out and looked and the

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,029
current Bitcoin database has about half

00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:09,490
a million blocks in it and a Bitcoin

00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,529
validation before transaction complete

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,809
for just one Bitcoin we can do this in

00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:16,090
parallel but for one Bitcoin on the

00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:17,590
average was taking about 10 minutes to

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,019
search all the way through the database

00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:23,980
and validate that yes this transaction

00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:27,070
could happen before and continue and

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,980
then number 2 in classic computer

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:32,289
science style we reduce the cost to do a

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,960
transaction we speed up how fast they

00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:36,789
can be done and accelerate and we get

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,309
everybody dived and then suddenly the

00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,260
business wants to sub slice and do a lot

00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:45,100
smaller of these and do a lot more of

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,899
them and so the number of transactions

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,059
that your business is going to want to

00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,880
accomplish in a particular asset

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:54,399
industry service can't has the potential

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,649
to go way way way up from what we do

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,230
today because of the amount of time and

00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:02,080
what we've saved well there's going to

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,450
be a hard limit and that hard limit is

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,059
the network speed I don't care how many

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:10,089
10 gigabit cards you put in your

00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:13,030
blockchain database server at some point

00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:15,940
you're just gonna go boom and I can't

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,280
get any more transactions in or out no

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,929
matter how many because I've hit the

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,609
physical limitation of my network

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:24,190
bandwidth whatever that is

00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:26,589
and so that becomes a challenge and

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,310
limitation upon this is not an

00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:34,000
infinitely scalable solution transaction

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:37,599
wise then there's the challenge of code

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,480
changes blockchain is written by humans

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,190
humans make mistakes mistakes get into

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,690
the code and have to be fixed and we're

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,119
gonna want to make enhancements for a

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:50,020
particular application or purpose back

00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,849
in 2003 2006 when Bitcoin was just

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,310
getting started and gaining traction in

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:56,020
its early years some developer went into

00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,599
the code and was looking at and said you

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,580
know what if I modify the order of these

00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,800
transactions and do them this way and

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,630
cut out these ten instructions I can

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,290
really speed up the transactional

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,330
verification rate of my Bitcoin and it

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,770
looked like it made sense and so he did

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,540
the modification ran

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,850
through some local testing looks solid

00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,430
good submitted it to the shared Bitcoin

00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,020
database of authority other developers

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,340
peaked at the code and went yeah that's

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,930
cool that's good all right I'm excited

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,060
let's put it out there we need to get

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,970
the transactions faster and so they

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,730
release it to production fortunately

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,700
only about 30 or 45 minutes into

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:36,010
production they start getting alerts and

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,630
errors something happened where the

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,400
previous blocks and the next blocks

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,050
weren't lining up and linking up there

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,670
was a break in the chain they go back

00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,290
and tie it to the code change that

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,960
happened and they have to stop

00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,880
everything and roll back now there's a

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,740
challenge they can't just roll back

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,730
because this is an authoritative

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,770
immutable hashed record okay so we can't

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,530
just go back and modify these blocks to

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:01,450
fix them because they're chained so they

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,580
actually have to go back and contact the

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,680
individual users who had submitted those

00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,810
achat transactions and approved them and

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,870
asked them to please resubmit those

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:13,510
transactions and do it in this order so

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,130
that we can correct the chain and is

00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,470
it's trustworthy and immutable Authority

00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,530
okay it's just a risk of the

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:23,050
implementation and the design we can't

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,780
make changes to the code that are going

00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:27,190
to break the chain and then finally

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,890
there's the whole challenge of user

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,630
acceptance okay one of those being while

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,310
blockchain once you submit the

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:37,390
attributes and the metrics or the

00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:39,790
characteristics into the database we can

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,460
add integrity and immutability to those

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,950
transactions but blockchain has no

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,830
capacity to say that they were right

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,930
when they were given to it okay so in

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,270
the case of our example it's somebody in

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,240
our land example of somebody

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:57,400
intentionally or unintentionally got the

00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,620
latitude and longitude coordinates wrong

00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,070
and those were stuck into the blockchain

00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,450
database from that point forward

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,640
blockchain can keep track of it and

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:09,220
demonstrate immutability and integrity

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,770
but twenty years later when a surveyor

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,800
sent out to revalidate the corners of

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,120
that property and finds out it's wrong I

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,270
don't know what's wrong

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,400
he has no opportunity or capacity to go

00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,220
back in and try to fix all of those

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,539
records in that chain they're wrong

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,209
there's just it's

00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:30,309
I don't know what you do okay so it

00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:32,949
actually creates a whole trustworthiness

00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:34,869
question for the users of wait a minute

00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:37,239
we've been building sells and receives

00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:39,089
on this land parcel and these attributes

00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:42,549
for last 20 years and now you tell me

00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:44,469
they're all wrong okay so it's a trust

00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:46,179
factor and then finally there's the

00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:48,519
issue of privacy if you're really going

00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:50,919
to speed up a particular industry you've

00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:54,009
got to take the blockchain database and

00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:56,079
put it out there and share it and let

00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:58,509
multiple businesses get into it and

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,429
access it and they're all going to trust

00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:02,619
it in some sense as an authoritative

00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:05,109
record of the transactions between

00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,869
businesses well if you put it out there

00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:09,819
in a public space it has the potential

00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,479
for other businesses or other event

00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:15,579
individuals to review the blockchain

00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:18,279
history of transactions and find out

00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,919
who's been selling to who and how much

00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:22,059
and when and all kinds of things such

00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:24,389
that you know what there may be a

00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:26,529
business that doesn't necessarily want

00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:28,059
journalists to know some of the

00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:30,099
industries and markets that it's

00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,989
involved in or who they're doing

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:35,439
business with and so there's the whole

00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:36,819
challenge of privacy that gets in the

00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:40,419
way when you have to make that

00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:43,419
blockchain public so that you can speed

00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:47,259
up the whole industry make sense all

00:38:43,419 --> 00:38:50,019
right but despite those limitations or

00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:51,729
challenges as difficult as they may be

00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:53,259
in some things that we've got to help

00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:56,079
educate and get comfortable and and

00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:59,139
solve when you compare it to the

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,869
advantages of what it does to bring a

00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:04,479
heightened level of authority trust

00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:05,709
integrity to the computer science space

00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,229
and the things that we manage and

00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:10,839
control the ability to allow businesses

00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:12,969
to do more transactions faster and to

00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,669
reduce the cost of each transaction I

00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:18,130
will argue that the advantage is far

00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:20,979
outweigh the disadvantages and there is

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:26,109
blockchain definitely happening in your

00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:28,569
future so with that thank you very much

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:30,159
I'm open to any questions or comments

00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:32,709
where you have something that can

00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,919
actually add value to our discussion yes

00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:34,919
sir

00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:48,310
not exactly yes and that they are

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,860
actually recorded in the merkel root

00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,470
hash as a friends fractional transaction

00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,170
of a Bitcoin and so yes you can sub

00:39:53,470 --> 00:40:00,490
slice the Bitcoin and you just keep

00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:03,150
track of it in the transactions yep yes

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,150
Aaron

00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,900
[Laughter]

00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:25,450
because you have not suggested the value

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,710
to Congress of transit racking the

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,540
versions of their bills that were

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,200
submitted and who did it and who made

00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,510
that change and why and all the rest

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,800
because maybe they don't want to know

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:53,770
people all right the good good question

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:56,470
yes sir the transactional rate of

00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:58,750
blockchain is very very high I cannot

00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:00,220
tell you what it exactly is but I know

00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,970
the guys that we're writing the

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:08,440
blockchain for Bitcoin realized that

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:11,410
they need to have some ability to do

00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,080
transactions as fast or faster than the

00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:17,140
financial industry does today so an

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,420
awful lot of trouble was done or made in

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:23,410
trying to figure out how to maximize and

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:28,480
opera and performance of that search

00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:31,660
function of the transactions that being

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,450
said they know that it's a linear

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,250
problem limit and I don't know what it

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,800
is but it's in the it's in the hundreds

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,120
of thousands of transactions a second is

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,590
what they've been able to demonstrate

00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,520
but I know we can't get to billions of

00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,380
transactions per second and yeah it's a

00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,630
problem absolutely is a problem there

00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,640
are there are some workaround

00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:54,190
opportunities where like if you search

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,600
the longest chain and once you get

00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,090
three-quarters of the way through the

00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,640
longest chain then you can say with 85

00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:02,080
or 90% assurance that you know what this

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,150
transaction probably is we're not gonna

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,040
find anybody else that modify that

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,740
therefore we'll take it and let it

00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,510
happen while we finish the validation

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,220
attempts to to speed it up but it's a

00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:16,710
problem absolutely a problem yes you're

00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,710
right yes sir

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:39,410
uh-huh yes um that I am limited in time

00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,480
to go into the level of detail that

00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,849
would really be necessary to show that

00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,160
the whole transactional record is

00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:48,950
authoritative including the signatures

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,020
the signatures are based upon a digital

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,270
signature that would be uniquely

00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,559
identified with an individual such that

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,180
there couldn't be anybody else that

00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,609
would steal that and there's a

00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:00,980
public/private key combination to those

00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,510
digital signatures but I don't I I

00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,039
simply was limited if I was trying to

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,549
get that far into the weeds I would have

00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:10,280
lost people so but it's there I know

00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:40,520
what you're asking and it's there to try

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:42,260
to create that assurance yes sir Wow I

00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:47,270
see what you're saying

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:49,130
I don't know of anything I'll give you a

00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,930
teaser of something you can go look at I

00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,400
just discovered this week I have no

00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,349
background other than to say it's out

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,309
there I don't even know if it's real

00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:59,210
somebody thinks that the blockchain

00:43:55,309 --> 00:44:01,760
technology is going so gangbusters and

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,760
has so much potential that they're

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,200
actually trying to use satellites to do

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,359
the blockchain technology and

00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,579
coordination and whatever and I can't

00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,920
think of the work name of it but if if

00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:16,059
you search on blockchain and time you'll

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,609
eventually run across this space chain I

00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:23,000
think technology and they will run into

00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:24,500
exactly the same problem with bandwidth

00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,630
and they may have answered it but that's

00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,140
the best that I can give you I it's a

00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,140
good question

00:44:29,280 --> 00:45:03,540
all right one more yes it depends upon

00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:05,400
the hash algorithm and so it would be a

00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,500
function of the algorithm that was

00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,140
implemented for that particular asset

00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:14,220
even if it was smaller if the algorithm

00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,500
is computationally strong enough it

00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,900
doesn't matter how big or small the acid

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,030
is that you're trying to track it's just

00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,240
a future you're just saying that I've

00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:26,100
created something that computationally

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:30,890
would take longer to solve and get then

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:33,240
it's the value of creating a signature e

00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,160
