Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Since first being predicted in 1999, the Internet of Things (IoT) has fully come of age in 2018. Cheaper and more powerful compute, broader global network coverage, and innovation in battery technology have opened new possibilities for leveraging technology in the physical world. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss the brief history of the Internet of Things, how the world of connected devices is changing the way we live, and what role open source, open hardware, and open standards play in the development of IoT. Session will include a hardware show and tell, and a fully functional deployment of an end-to-end IoT demo lab, using several open and/or open source components: an ESP32 based development board, MQTT, and microPython.
