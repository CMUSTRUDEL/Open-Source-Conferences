Title: OLF 2018 - Open Source and the Internet of Things
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Since first being predicted in 1999, the Internet of Things (IoT) has fully come of age in 2018. Cheaper and more powerful compute, broader global network coverage, and innovation in battery technology have opened new possibilities for leveraging technology in the physical world. In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss the brief history of the Internet of Things, how the world of connected devices is changing the way we live, and what role open source, open hardware, and open standards play in the development of IoT. Session will include a hardware show and tell, and a fully functional deployment of an end-to-end IoT demo lab, using several open and/or open source components: an ESP32 based development board, MQTT, and microPython.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
so my name is Eric Miller I'm a

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,750
consultant I've been working in IT since

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,849
about I don't know Devon when did we

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,800
build my first computer on the living

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,080
room floor 2000 1999

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,600
so about 20 years since about 2009 I've

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,369
been focusing mostly on the cloud cloud

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,250
architecture see ICD workflows for

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,980
development teams stuff like that so my

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,869
day job I spend my time working with

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,910
really big and really large quantities

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,820
of computers far away don't really know

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,320
where they are and so on the weekends

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,000
and evenings it's fun to play around

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,489
with these tiny little computers that we

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,690
can touch which I miss a lot right those

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,610
of you that were you know sort of

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,110
racking and stacking servers it's fun

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,450
touch systems we don't get to do that

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,620
anymore with the cloud so that's we're

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,239
gonna talk about today is these tiny

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,309
little systems and the development

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,530
frameworks particularly in the context

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,100
of open source software and open source

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,960
licensing around the internet of things

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:02,190
so it's me we already talked about that

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,710
not interesting so this the subject

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,170
matter is Internet of Things pass

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,330
through the filter of open source and so

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,650
we'll talk we'll spend maybe two you

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,119
know three or five minutes talking about

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,770
what IOT is and sort of a timeline then

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,680
we'll drill in a little bit to open

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,720
source and IOT specifically hardware I

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,250
have brought some stuff to sort of pass

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,590
around show-and-tell for you guys to

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,600
look at little bits and bubbles would

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,250
you call this Devon my nerd box of

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,780
holding yeah that's what that is

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,630
it's a saving throw you can throw

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,140
against the box if you want to and I

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,869
also have a little demo that we'll do if

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,250
we have time all right and like the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,369
previous speaker who was here for the

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,740
children and code session before yeah

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,689
that was great I really like that like

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,060
that session please feel free to like

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,619
stop me or just interrupt and say you

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,030
know let's have a discussion about this

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,979
doesn't necessarily have to be me

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,079
standing up here wall of texting you

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,520
guys if you want to say something or

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,490
have a comment or if I get something

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,079
wrong feel free to to jump in and and

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,909
correct me or share your thoughts

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,860
so let's level set a little bit what is

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,300
IOT everybody knows that IOT stands for

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,459
Internet of Things but what's the story

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,210
what's the backstory how did we get to

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,930
have

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,680
this in our vernacular so 1999 a guy

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,870
named Kevin Ashton who worked at Procter

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,410
& Gamble right down the road he did an

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,000
internal presentation talking about

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,430
linking the idea of these at the time

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,040
new RFID tags being put on their

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,650
products to track them through their

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,420
supply chain right and so that is where

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,270
the term Internet of Things was born

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,940
from Kevin Ashton's internal discussion

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,040
with Procter and Gamble back in 1999 I

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,230
also like this quote by this gentleman

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,880
by the name of Neil gross this was in

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,950
Businessweek now keep in mind this is

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,180
1999 and this is what Neal had to say I

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,720
don't if you guys can see this so I read

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,730
it out loud

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,460
in the next century planet Earth will

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,170
Don an electric skin it will use the

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,450
internet as a scaffold to support and

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,070
transmit its sensations the skin is

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,510
already being stitched together it

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,400
consists of millions of embedded

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,990
electronic measuring devices thermostats

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,430
pressure gauges pollution detectors

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,360
cameras microphones glucose enters EKGs

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,100
electroencephalograph s-- these will

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,960
probe and monitor cities and endangered

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,290
species the atmosphere our ships

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,550
highways and fleets or trucks are

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,880
conversations our bodies and even our

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:28,440
dreams now considering what was going on

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,210
in 1999 and the love and what technology

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,170
was telling us about what it was capable

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,790
of that's a pretty amazing sort of bit

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,440
of for these people who can do this that

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,630
like see the future and predict it with

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,950
such accuracy they always blow me away

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,110
and he really nailed it right like

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,630
that's really where we are today we are

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,550
donning an electric skin and what we

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,990
were doing in 1999 did not look like we

00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,160
were headed in that direction the best

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:56,670
we had to offer was you know not great

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,860
so the the real IOT according to Cisco

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,930
and I like this definition according to

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,210
Cisco the real IOT was born though in

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,980
around 2008 2009 and this is the point

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,110
at which there actually became more

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,150
things connected to the internet than

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,830
there were people so I think that's a

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,840
really good definition in the moment the

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,280
the things take over then it really does

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,260
become the Internet of Things right we

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,760
could sort of get subjugated to to the

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,940
things and it becomes their Internet

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,270
right also to just about three years

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,340
later ipv6 was launched publicly

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,919
and that's obviously going to be a big

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,900
enabler for IOT because IOT means

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,340
millions and billions of things in fact

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,900
in my day job we deploy a IOT platforms

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,400
for companies that have tens of

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,580
thousands or hundreds of thousands of

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,770
these endpoints and so IP space you know

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,949
being diluted is a big problem

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,300
so ipv6 solves that and I didn't know

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:54,150
this until I was preparing for this but

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,139
ipv6 allocates 340 undecillion I don't

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,400
know if I'm saying that right any

00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,050
mathematicians know if I'm saying

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,370
indecision right I am

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,490
guy back there's nodding like yeah you

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,139
got it indecision 340 undecillion

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,229
discrete addresses so I was interested

00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,180
in that what a undecillion was and in

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,610
the context of really big numbers here's

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,380
million and billion here's everybody

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,750
knows Google and Google Plex the biggest

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,000
name numbers right googolplex is 10 to

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,270
the 10 to 100 indus Cillian is 10 to the

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,940
36 it's a really really really big

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,979
number that we're that we're considering

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,930
here in fact it's an it's a big enough

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:36,240
number that you could it's enough to

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,010
assign a single address to every atom on

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,930
the surface of the earth and still have

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,169
enough addresses left to do another

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,880
hundred plus Earth's right so we are

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:49,500
ready for IOT with ipv6 right and that's

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,039
a good thing because these big numbers

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,530
are coming these are real statistics 6.4

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,520
billion connected things in use in 2018

00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:02,520
that's up 30% from 2015 and we are

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,919
estimated to projected to hit 2021

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,930
billion connected devices so through

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,320
roughly three times the population of

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,840
Earth by 2020 let's hope these things

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,590
don't get guns right or something else

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,820
smart right because we're whipped all

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:24,800
right so pop quiz if if ipv6 supports

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:29,039
320 whatever those were India Killians

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,050
addresses how many addresses without

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,229
googling I'm watching you how many

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,510
addresses roughly rounded to the nearest

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,810
million wouldn't it be the guy who knew

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,850
how to pronounce in de Killian

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,410
raising his hand right is there anybody

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,450
else who knows this question what's that

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,639
4.2 billion and for that you are going

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,770
to get one of these ports sir that's the

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,940
or I could validate your parking take

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,310
your pick

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,460
so yeah four so you think about four

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,900
billion four billion is a pretty small

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,270
number right like that's a number we can

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,730
and we can we can actually comprehend

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,080
it's the number roughly that's almost or

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,910
I don't was it seven billion we have on

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,800
the planet Earth people it's a it's a

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,320
real number right this other number of

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,370
devices is unconceivable it's like

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,770
trying to conceive the the size of space

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:23,380
as far as the arc of I've lost my mouth

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,910
that's not good there we go

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,540
as far as sort of the arc on the hype

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,100
curve this is IOT in 2011 it was on its

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,840
way up and this is with all this hype

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,910
curve is sort of something like Gartner

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,650
and other companies use to sort of gauge

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,540
like what's what's real what's gonna

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,370
have legs and stick and what's just sort

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,830
of emerging tech that hasn't really

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,870
proven itself yet so IOT uit was on the

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,100
way in all the way on the way up in 2011

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,930
and it peaked in in 2014 and honestly i

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,250
think that now you know it's the this is

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,680
more about hype than it is about

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,030
longevity now I think IOT has just

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,740
become you know it's like unleaded

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,780
gasoline right it's it's here to stay

00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,410
it's gonna grow and there's lots of

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:04,289
opportunities so so here's me here's my

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,090
little sort of like how did we get from

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:10,570
you know need not having a term for IOT

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,740
to twenty years ago when Kevin coined

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,510
his term to needing that so because

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,340
those of you who work in this industry

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,470
you know that having these systems talk

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,150
to other systems and a machine machine

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,710
distributed systems connected systems

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,780
whatever gonna call him that's not new

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,700
we integrate api's with api is all the

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,320
time that we didn't need a special word

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,700
for that so why do we have the special

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,470
word what's the what's the impetus

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,330
behind that well i think it's three

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,820
changes and so it's a series of changes

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,640
that happened in three major buckets

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,890
technology people and business now the

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,589
technology is really the main enabler

00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,950
and it's really about compute getting

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,900
smaller batteries getting more efficient

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,520
more reliable easier to charge and also

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,720
network becoming you know who remembers

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,840
when you needed a cup take a look at a

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,580
coverage map

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,470
you were like buying your internet

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,610
connectivity right yeah you know you

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,290
don't have to do that anymore like if

00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,420
there's people there there's internet we

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,830
have internet at 30,000 feet we have

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,570
internet in the ocean we have internet

00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,620
you know on the tiniest island in the

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,130
Caribbean when you go on vacation it's

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,150
everywhere so those three things the

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,710
compute getting smaller faster and

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,030
cheaper battery technology improving and

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,560
network sort of becoming more ubiquitous

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,680
and more spread out what technology

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,700
drove that was it IOT what was that

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,050
what's that yeah that was part of it but

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,120
what was the major like what were we

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,160
buying a lot of as a society that drove

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,420
that those prices down that's right

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,410
everybody's holding their phones up

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,320
that's exactly right

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,670
cell phones mobile connectivity

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,860
particularly smart phones because the

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,120
smart phones have that that magical

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,650
requirement of needing to drive a

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,730
display and be able to do smart things

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,170
around applications so they need a

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,020
little bit more processing power so

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,780
smart phones are what drove or what

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,280
enabled IOT we we bought billions and

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,410
billions of these things that we got

00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,180
really good at making chips and the dye

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,890
process is smaller and faster and

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,240
cheaper we got really good at making

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,470
batteries that are small and lasts a

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,870
really long time they're easy to charge

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,730
and we got really good at canvassing the

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,260
entire world with Network and we don't

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,810
have Network we can spin up networks

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,180
like Laura or even Sat satellite

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,220
connectivity somebody's laughing at

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,070
Laura like I had a bad Laura experience

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,740
right on yeah that that's not that's not

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,290
unheard of but all these network

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,140
connectivity options that's really what

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,910
enabled IOT and also people so 20 years

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,100
ago if we had been walking through like

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,470
Home Depot together and walked past a

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,660
refrigerator that was you know that was

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,470
Wi-Fi enabled we would have first of all

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,520
it wouldn't been there because it

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,960
would've been cost prohibitive it's not

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,400
a retail that's something that like you

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,480
buy an Abu Dhabi and there's five of

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,280
them on the face of the planet they're

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,020
gold-plated right but but if we have

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,490
seen that in Home Depot we would have

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,650
looked at each other and said who in the

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,390
heck needs up connected refrigerator

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,670
that's ridiculous back when I had a flip

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,870
phone right right this guy's got I got

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,520
one you got one now right and but but

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,830
today we've changed the way we think

00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,270
like we are so connected we are so used

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,100
to connected things we were so used to

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,470
being able to order

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,060
a screen like we've changed how we think

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,420
about connectivity and being connected

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,860
at like the DNA level as a society we

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,560
are very familiar and comfortable with

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,449
apps right so like downloading an app to

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,000
work with my refrigerator or my toaster

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,560
oven or my doorbell or my thermostat

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,329
that doesn't that's not foreign to me or

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,709
anybody else right it makes sense 20

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,029
years ago would have been it would have

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,380
been crazy right people would have been

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,459
like you really have a fridge that you

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,670
have an app that you manage what is

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:29,259
wrong with you right that changed and

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,529
then the third thing was with all of

00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,329
these with compute getting smaller and

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,709
cheaper businesses want to differentiate

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,160
they want to they want to be able to

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:40,449
bolt on new features to their to their

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,649
products without having to cut into the

00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,699
profits too much that you don't have to

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,319
buy a gold-plated one of there's only

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,880
five on the planet we don't make money

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:47,829
five seven five things we make millions

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,630
money selling five hundred thousand or

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,949
five million things so we want to be

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,620
able to bolt on new things and that's

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:56,829
where we saw things like the doorbell

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,860
and the thermostat nest and ring and all

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:02,290
these real IOT products so those are the

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,899
three things that changed people

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,329
technology and business drove this but

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,649
really the biggest change was that cell

00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,449
phone and the millions that we bought

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:11,860
and the the infrastructure and the

00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:13,899
capabilities to build these things cheap

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,980
that came along with that all right so

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,649
let's drill down a little bit this is

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,600
Linux fast open source open source event

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,759
I'm gonna talk open source right so

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
let's talk about IOT through the lens of

00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,110
open source there's a lot to talk about

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,339
so you want to make sure that we know

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,810
that there's not this isn't really a big

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,889
chunk of IOT it's actually a smaller

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,089
section but we want to talk about

00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,860
because it's interesting and relevant

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,009
for this so everybody here I think knows

00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,870
that there's an open software initiative

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,060
right this is a Linux otherwise we

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:44,230
wouldn't be here right Linux event very

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:47,589
much and sort of tectonic in the open

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,060
software community right but many people

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,339
are surprised to learn that there is an

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,290
open hardware initiative as well raise

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,939
your hand if you knew that already okay

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,269
so about two-thirds or three-quarters

00:12:54,939 --> 00:13:00,550
good there they have their own they have

00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,750
their own and I have completely lost my

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,470
mouse here it's really really annoying

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,120
they have their own organization they

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,390
have their own logo in fact we can go

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,940
see if I can get out of

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:18,580
you know bad things are happening sorry

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,750
guys my mouse is just not visible and I

00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:26,800
don't know why my mouse is visible on

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,080
the screen okay occasionally visible on

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,600
the screen so no oh there we go

00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:36,580
I have it back awesome I'm gonna end the

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,770
show so that ere we go I think that's

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,040
the problem as my Mac was struggling to

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:45,550
to deal with that so I want to show you

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,320
here real fast the the open source

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,910
Foundation website and they've got a

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,400
certification process you can contact

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,890
them if you've got a hardware project

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,050
either a personal project or even a like

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,490
a semi commercial open source project

00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,310
like Red Hat right Red Hat as a business

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,040
but they also have an open source

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,450
project operating system so you can get

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,710
you can contact them and have them

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,440
certify your project and then you can

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,900
start using this little stamp you can

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,130
get that silkscreen on to your boards or

00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,760
on your project or use it on your

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,810
website out of that movement there are

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,190
actually some things that I'm sure

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,260
you're familiar with right how many of

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,370
you have heard of an Arduino right I'm

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,730
gonna pass one around here in a few

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,370
minutes

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,260
Arduino is completely open source what

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,800
about a RepRap fewer people I'm guessing

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,450
yeah riprap is a 3d printer that mostly

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,220
can print its own components so once you

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,750
get the first one printed there are some

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,040
metal components that you buy that sort

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,840
of off the shelf but then you can make

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,940
you know one can make many of them and

00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,850
they're really high quality to Raspberry

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,830
Pi everybody knows that open source also

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,730
interesting spark fun and Adafruit which

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,680
I think many of you are probably

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,710
familiar with hobbyist electronics

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,650
retailer online they were both sort of

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,420
founded in this concept of everything

00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,550
that we build and sell we're going to

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,870
publish the schematics online so right

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,760
where you right at the point of sale

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,220
where you buy the thing you could also

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,150
download the schematics and like if you

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,530
didn't want to buy it and have the

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,420
capability to build one you could or

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,670
build it on a breadboard why that's

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,590
useful is we're typically going to use

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,990
these types of boards development boards

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,270
to prototype something it's not common

00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,710
that a real enterprise IOT solution is

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,050
built off of an Arduino or Raspberry Pi

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,880
like out of the box what a developer

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,680
will do is take that platform if it's

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,279
suitable and they'll the breadboard

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,740
around it

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,269
get it working and then they'll they'll

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,339
take the schematic that they have

00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,600
because it's open source they'll rip out

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,220
the parts that they don't need they'll

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,990
they'll add the parts that they do need

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,490
have an electronic an electrical

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,410
engineer do that and then they'll send

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,550
off ego files to a PCB fab place and

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,319
then we'll have their thing come back

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,110
that might have the same chip power

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,939
supply and USB or serial as a Arduino or

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,439
Raspberry Pi but then it has other stuff

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:49,240
on it that they added for for their

00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:51,129
solution right so that's why this is

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,689
really important and why the companies

00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:55,540
like spark front and Adafruit are really

00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:57,939
cool now let's talk about especially in

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,569
the context of hardware how open-source

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:03,189
is it so it's not like you know Linux

00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,870
software or a completely open-source

00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:06,279
software we have really strict rules and

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,079
everything everything that it references

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,829
everything in the in the I'm sure

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,019
there's some of you that could teach

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,309
classes on like the different licensing

00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,899
I'm not an expert on it right I just

00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,319
kind of there's more people raise their

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:18,579
hands but in in the hardware world

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,800
that's really hard to do to have

00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:23,170
something that is like completely pure

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,540
open-source and that's mostly because of

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,699
the chips right Atmel chips the ARM

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,379
chips that we put on raspberry PI's the

00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:30,220
ESP 32 chips that we're going to talk

00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,319
about today

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,089
you know those companies are they're

00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:35,259
commercial and they're competitive and

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,990
they don't really release their stuff

00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:40,059
but a kind of company can still be have

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,279
a proprietary solution and have an open

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,170
look and feel lots of development

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,329
frameworks and lots of development

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,600
boards where the components are open and

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,639
available but the actual you know chip

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,529
schematic is not so there are some gray

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,209
areas particularly Arduino Arduino

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,559
Raspberry Pi ESP boards these all have

00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:58,000
the open hardware stamp on them all

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,430
three of them have at least one

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,779
component that's not open right and

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,890
there's also some other boards like

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,270
these little like this little guy here

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,559
this you can get in China not with the

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,780
OLED but you can get them without the

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:16,899
OLED for about $2 each in in packs of 20

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,839
and it's an esp8266 and we're talking

00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:20,949
about here in a second these these are

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,149
all made in China and they don't you

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,620
know they're not really big on open

00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:25,149
source and not that they're anti they're

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,809
not explicitly going through the process

00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:30,370
of getting their chips or their board's

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,289
certified but they don't really do

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,460
anything to hide the the schematics from

00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,660
you in fact if you ask them for them

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,250
they'll give them to you

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,930
and if you can look you know this is all

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,520
surface mount components and there's not

00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,140
a lot going on you can figure out what's

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,270
on the board so it's kind of a weird

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,590
space it's not really exactly analogous

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,500
to software where we have these real

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,270
strict rules and real strict licenses

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,610
it's it's more of a kind of a Wild West

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:55,600
but there is a lot of open stuff going

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:57,880
on all right so let's let's drill into

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,050
these to the hardware I'm really glad I

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,020
got my mouse back that would have been

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:03,970
really really tough to finish this so

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,350
this is a little blog post or something

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,950
that somebody did that does a really

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,450
good job of articulating what

00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,890
development boards are available in 2018

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,090
and I'm not going to go through them all

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,440
certainly every board that we're going

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,520
to talk about today raspberry PI's

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,260
arduino z' ESP 32 and 66 is the Intel

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,660
Edison is on here but I just want to

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,520
quickly show you like all of the boards

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,870
this is pretty comprehensive and all of

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,880
the units some of them Wi-Fi you see

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,890
some antennas on there there's a big

00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,200
round that's a right which is a really

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,330
powerful development board so the

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,400
dynamic here is very much like a

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,500
craftsperson right when you who here

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,390
does like woodworking or other types of

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,070
crafts with your hands right when you

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,720
start a project you have a plan and

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,670
you're gonna need materials and tools to

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,110
build that thing right and you don't

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,520
really go grab the tools before you have

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,230
the plan well the same thing with IOT

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,480
project we're gonna talk about battery

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,980
consumption does it have does it have

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,150
local network available or do we need to

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,710
have some other type of network

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,020
connectivity we're gonna have hardwired

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,220
power what type of processor does it

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,040
need to have does it need to have any

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,620
type of battery management or low power

00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,660
mode to save battery right these are all

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,910
questions in your plan and then you go

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,190
grab a tool that that is suitable to

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,840
execute this the plan that you have I

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,780
mean there's a lot of overlap between

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,820
these these tools okay so lots of

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,890
choices and by the way all of the links

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,750
and code and everything that I'm sharing

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,730
with you guys today I haven't put it on

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,080
a github repo yet but I will and

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,550
afterwards if you want to come up and

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
get I'll give you my email address and

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,280
you can email me and I'll send you the

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,750
link to the repo I literally just

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,940
finished this like in the hallway this

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:38,320
morning so I had time to post it so the

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,230
by all means let me know and I'll give

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,110
you all that stuff so today we're gonna

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,169
focus on these boards here the ESP this

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,230
is a company called expressive so

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:52,019
SP 82 66 which this is and these other

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,299
ones are is sort of the Honda Civic of

00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,919
the IOT world now these are real

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,980
grown-up chips that you build real

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,779
grown-up IOT solutions out of right this

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,720
is the you know there's millions and

00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:06,029
millions of esp8266 t6 is out in the

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,350
field running production code and

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:13,200
delivering IOT data somewhere right

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,909
about I don't know three years ago

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:23,669
espresso if came out with the big

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:26,429
brother to the ESP 32 esp8266 it's

00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:27,600
substantial I don't know if you can see

00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,450
that very well you probably can't I'll

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,460
go I'll go big screen for a second and

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:38,369
lose my mouse again probably so this

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,149
thing has the ESP 32 most most notably

00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:44,489
has Bluetooth whereas the the 82 66 does

00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:47,129
not it has twice the clock speed it has

00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:50,639
some SRAM and flash neither of which the

00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:53,999
the 32 66 has has nearly twice the GPIO

00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:55,619
pin so GPIO pins are these little pins

00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:57,149
that we use to interact to interface

00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,799
with the outside world so if we want to

00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:59,580
hook up an LED or another sensor and

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,440
accelerometer

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,769
we do that through here and if we want

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,929
to have some some solenoid switch or

00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,669
turn on a light or a fan we would also

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,009
do that through the GPIO this is the

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:13,080
general purpose input and output and the

00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,929
32 has almost twice as many pins which

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,759
is really a big deal right because you

00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,629
can get a lot more sort of value out of

00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,190
the chip then you would twice the value

00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,700
it also and we're gonna see this here in

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,039
a second

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,019
this chip itself not the board the chip

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:31,710
just a little tiny square that you see

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:34,109
here has three onboard sensors that this

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,609
82 66 does not it has a Hall effect

00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:38,419
sensor who-knows-what Hall effect sensor

00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:40,619
does what's a Hall effect sensor do

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:42,299
measures magnetic field right this chip

00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,739
has one on it we don't need to bolt it

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,669
in through GPIO and an or put it on the

00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:47,129
board it's right there inside that

00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,840
little tiny can it has a temperature

00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:50,789
sensor it's not a really good one that's

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,039
not it's not consistent from board to

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,659
board and also to this can on the

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,980
outside which doubles as a heatsink kind

00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,269
of prevents you from making contact with

00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,520
it so it's just I don't know why they

00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,490
put it on there but

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,350
works and they have a capacitive touch

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,060
sensor so we can assign capacitive touch

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,440
to one of these pins which is basically

00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,140
mapped to one of the pins on the board

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,760
and then we can touch it with with a

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,990
hand and the board will know that it's

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,780
being touched this is useful for things

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,980
like you could you could wire it to a

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,090
doorframe of course we're talking I'm

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,680
not wearing this board you build a

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,420
finished system that is a box that you

00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,920
mount to the ball to the wall you wire

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,880
it to doorframe wire to a desk and

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,460
you'll be able to tell if someone has

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,260
touched that thing how many times same

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,910
thing with the hall sensor just by

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,240
mounting a very small device about a

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,350
third of this size to a door and putting

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,490
a magnet you could tell how many times

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,420
the doors been open whether the door is

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,670
currently open or closed

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,170
things like that without ever bolting

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,410
anything just just with the processor

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,750
itself not needing any any peripherals

00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,310
so let's let me share with you guys some

00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,810
some hardware I'll tell you what they

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,800
are and then I'm gonna pass them around

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,510
in this little this is from our CSA it's

00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,950
got it's got real high-tech anti-static

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,220
stuff in the bottom of it

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,330
Brants tool Farah man still orchards so

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,280
we've got a lot of cool stuff in here

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,960
we've got two Arduino so I think you

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,950
guys recognize these blue ones right

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,710
we've got an 82 66 with an OLED on it

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,150
right that we can power up and it would

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,460
have like a little logo we can we can

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,440
output data to that we've got a tiny

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,730
little teensy which is an Arduino board

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,130
which now belongs to you

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,990
right so you can keep it when it gets

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,310
you or we've got a Raspberry Pi zero

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,230
it's a great development platform for

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:29,570
for IOT especially if you can leave it

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,010
hardwired to power and we've got this

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,930
ayat a Neum board which is something

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,690
that one of my co-workers developed from

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:38,210
scratch this is his own design and it's

00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,650
ESP 32 board the one that's really

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,700
interesting please be careful with these

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,260
I mean you can touch them and you'd have

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,300
to worry about static or just be careful

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,130
because they'll break the one that's

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,980
really really special to me though is

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,800
this one here I need more hands or more

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:59,210
real estate the one that's really cool

00:23:51,800 --> 00:24:01,070
is this one here this is just an 82 66

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,110
there's no there's no power there's no

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,090
USB it's literally just like buying that

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,350
chip from espresso and putting it on a

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,060
breakout board and getting the chips

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,740
broken out two pins right that's it

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,390
there's nothing else on the board and I

00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,830
like this because it helps kind of build

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,600
an intuition like you plug this into a

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,770
breadboard unfortunately they designed

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,120
it so if you plugged it in a breadboard

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,060
it covers up all the pins so I need to

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,160
build this wonky adapter to make it work

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,050
this is just a USB power supply so it

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,370
would take up it takes the place of a

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,750
lot of the circuitry that would be on a

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,460
finished board but there's no

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,340
usb-to-serial there's no power supply

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,070
there's no GPIO you know pins

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,120
it's just the chip so when you fiddle

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,010
with this you really get a good

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,840
intuition of like what the chip can do

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,750
because you're only interfacing with the

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,540
chip itself this one I use to build a

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,070
nightlight with my kids it runs a little

00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,700
webserver and then you can hit that

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,800
webserver

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,960
we have a DNS map to it the private IP

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,260
of this thing and it we put it inside a

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,780
3d printed minecraft cube right the

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,770
Minecraft block and those of you how

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,250
many of you know what this thing is

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,750
about a quarter so this is this is what

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,130
you build stuff out of in Minecraft or

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,720
some things and it comes in different

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:11,120
colors red is redstone blue is lapis get

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,680
this wrong and pink they say is some

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,180
kind of like nether crystal or something

00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,680
right but every time they hit this in

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,090
point they can they can get their iPads

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,650
out and they can just go to night light

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,760
that Miller house done you can go you

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,620
can't get on my network so it's fine

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,360
night night light not Miller house

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,500
thought something I forget and they

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,850
refresh it and they get a new color

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,990
every time they refresh it right and

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,030
their interface looks like this and it

00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,590
tells them what they get so I'll pass

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:34,880
this around soon and you guys can just

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:40,250
look at this while I'm gabbing there you

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,720
go so that's what you're having your

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,840
hands there that's what that's just a

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,670
small like sample of what a hardware

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,190
developer hold on a second what a

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,050
hardware developer or next or an

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,270
engineer would use to start a project

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,520
right depending again talking talking

00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,930
back to that slide if it's the right use

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,420
case right we're not just gonna grab any

00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,320
board just to address any problem you

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,940
have to kind of look at the parameters

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,300
of the problem yes sir you with the

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:16,790
blinky years fantastic

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:22,470
that's really helpful there we go

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:23,760
perfect so I'll go back here we go so

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,320
here's the nightlight the 3d printed

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,110
nightlight that's what it looks like in

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,940
its case and it's just paper inside

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,040
there and then and then that that little

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,250
unit that ESP that breadboard that's

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,070
what's in the black box here and then it

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,870
turns red for redstone blue for lapis it

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,010
does like 17 different we did all of

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,780
them right and this is what they're

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,820
interfacing but that little web server

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,030
that's running on that tiny little chip

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:55,710
right this HTML is coming from that ship

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:58,950
it's really really really cool it's a I

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,180
found the cube files on Thingiverse and

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,290
just kind of hacked him up a little bit

00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,060
because they were like I needed the

00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:05,610
bottom shaved off to get the stuff

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,780
inside it I have the STL's though and so

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:07,740
if you come up afterwards and give me

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,280
your email address I'll send it to you

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,950
right and I also have the code for it

00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,390
too so if you get an 82 66 or a 32 dev

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,020
board you can just plop this stuff on

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,520
there and it'll work for you alright

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,930
thank you so much for telling me that

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,700
you couldn't see my slides that I

00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,890
couldn't see the other stuff right that

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,930
would have been pretty bad so let's talk

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,210
about development frameworks right this

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,560
being open-source right so development

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,060
frameworks for IOT are broken up into

00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,500
sort of three tiers we've got what goes

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,790
on the device today we're gonna talk

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,010
about micro Python we got what have what

00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,140
goes on the Gateway so it's very common

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,120
to have a gateway device that sort of

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,470
Shepherds out connectivity like a

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,420
wireless access point right but

00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,120
specifically for IOT the Shepherd's got

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,410
connectivity to lots of local devices

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,090
aggregates that data and then sends it

00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,850
to some endpoint in the cloud and then

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,260
we have the cloud back-end right by the

00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,570
way we're gonna build a solution day on

00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,430
the cloud in 2018 and beyond there is

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,320
absolutely no reason no good reason to

00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,780
build IOT solutions in the data center

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,660
on physical spinny drive hardware that

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:09,960
is dumb right somewhere between dumb and

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,790
like just technically impossible and the

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,560
reason is your devices are gonna scale

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,000
up and down the amount of traffic that

00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,440
they send to the cloud and you don't

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,550
want to be paying for full capacity all

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,200
the time you want that to scale up and

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,230
down with it

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,610
we use a cloud service so that we're not

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,900
so that we're not you know managing

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,820
infrastructure instead of just getting

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,380
the data we won so it's important to

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:32,150
point out though that the of these

00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:34,730
frameworks that see we use you can see

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:39,590
these are C C++ Python and micro Python

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:41,210
Java JavaScript and PHP that there's a

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,300
lot of open source representation here

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:47,120
the new implementation of C is open

00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,820
source as is GCC the compiler Java has

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,920
an open JDK Python and micro Python both

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,890
100% open source PHP is open source and

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:59,000
Sigma raise your hand no just yawning

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:01,610
sorry PHP is a hundred percent open

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,860
source and C++ and JavaScript not

00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:07,010
technically open source they're overseen

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,150
by a Standards Committee so they have

00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,830
kind of an open source look and feel

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,960
because they're an open standard right

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,370
but they don't adhere to an MIT license

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,230
or anything like that so a lot of

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,120
openness represented here in the

00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,520
frameworks that we have today we are

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,220
going to be zeroing on specifically on

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,310
micro Python I like micro Python because

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,770
I have a background in in Linux and UNIX

00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,690
administration and Microban Python was

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,700
sort of a natural jump for me for two

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,440
from bash right to do stuff that bash

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,910
couldn't handle and so like many of you

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,180
who are Linux people I think Python is a

00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:40,190
sort of a great utility language it's

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,660
also being used it's actually become the

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,580
most used language in the industry right

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,070
now because of machine learning it's the

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,450
de-facto language for data science right

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,100
now I'm so PI if you don't know a

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,240
language are you are you one of the

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,650
you're considering learning language

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
Python is a really good place to start

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,750
because it's widely widely supported and

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,270
it's really the de facto language of

00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,100
data science but we can't put python 3

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,590
on a tiny little microcontroller it's

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,300
way way too heavy right so we need a

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,760
special version of python called micro

00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,330
Python so we have that and that was it

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,530
was it's about four years old now it was

00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:14,440
started by a guy named Damien Damien

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,370
George he had a Kickstarter campaign

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,950
there was a board that went along with

00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,690
it it's written in C it's released under

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,520
the MIT license that's completely

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:24,150
open-source and it's a full Python

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,170
compiler and runtime

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:27,630
that runs on the microcontroller

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,510
hardware itself and it presents the user

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,560
with a interactive repple repla we're

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,210
gonna say that word a lot so and make

00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,610
sure I share with everybody what it

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:38,460
means it's a read evaluate print loop

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,960
they get that right yeah read evaluate

00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,090
print it's so those of you that know

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,470
Python it's the three little arrows that

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,360
you get when you when you log into a

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,630
Python sister or when you open up height

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,290
on

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,790
so that's micro Python and in a minute

00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:54,450
we'll look at the micro Python

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:55,560
repository but here is the different

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:57,300
ports that they have available for

00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,250
microphone and you can see they have the

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,140
32 and the 80 to 66 no are do we know

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,660
because Arduino doesn't really have

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,350
enough resources to to run micro Python

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,150
alright

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:11,310
so it's time for everybody to to we're

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,980
gonna do the demo and before we get

00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:17,820
started this is a live demo at a tech

00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:20,010
event and so what that means is we just

00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,350
everybody just take a moment of silence

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:26,430
okay you do your thing I'm gonna do my

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,650
thing all right we're good I think we'll

00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:31,050
see all right so what we're gonna build

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,390
today this is what a real IOT solution

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,030
looks like in the cloud we start with

00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,040
aired with devices hundreds tens of

00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,300
thousands millions of devices and they

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,160
all have some sort of code running on

00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,630
them that gathers data and sensitive KOB

00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,100
sometimes will send data back to them to

00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,350
tell them to do things we'll have some

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,550
sort of authentication so that not not

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,560
just anybody who has knowledge of the

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,270
system can start you know if you fire me

00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,530
from your from your team and I can start

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,180
sending stuff to the cloud you don't

00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,620
want that it has to be secure then we

00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,390
have a device gateway it's an endpoint

00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,190
that we're gonna send the data to but

00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,240
then once it's in the cloud we can do

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,590
whatever we want to with it we can

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,690
trigger lambda functions we can put it

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,820
in a document store we can put it on s3

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,870
or some other blob storage we're not

00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,520
going to show that today we're just

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,680
going to show these three nodes right

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,970
real quickly just want to point out I

00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,320
know we're using a commercial cloud

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:16,610
provider to build this today which is

00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,770
AWS but I just wanted to point out that

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:22,380
there's a lot of open source support on

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,090
AWS for this stuff so we're using micro

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Python on our chip we're using MQTT

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,450
which is an open standard to send our

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,730
data to the cloud and then once we get

00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:33,750
it to lambda it's any one of several

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,720
open source or open frameworks java.net

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,539
Korn PowerShell Python go

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,340
node which is javascript under the hood

00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:42,140
those are all fully supported so even

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,260
though we're in commercial ville 4 who's

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,900
hosting it we don't lose the open

00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,250
capabilities to do our thing and that's

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,370
what this slide was supposed to sort

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:55,640
open myself there all right so for the

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,260
demo what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,640
just show you how to build micro Python

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,350
I'll show you how to flash the board

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,760
this is basically what you would do if

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,590
you got a board in the mail from

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,539
Adafruit or from went over to Micro

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,559
Center and bought an SP 32 board what

00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:08,720
would you do on your first day of

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,490
playing around with it right you get it

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,100
out and you put and put microphone on it

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,480
you want to connect over a serial I'll

00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,280
show you some helper libraries and what

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,710
they do Shea how to connect to the web

00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,750
ripple and then Shea upload scripts and

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:24,350
then eventually we'll connect it to a

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,580
cloud service and we'll see data flowing

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,659
to the cloud and before we do that I

00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,210
just want to make sure that my cloud

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:32,750
service is still accepting my connection

00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,950
Thank You cloud service okay so the

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,390
first thing we want to do and I'll be

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,950
going back to this to keep me on track

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,770
here is we want to build micro Python

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,620
now like many of you how many of your

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:46,940
software developers or engineers okay so

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,320
about 15 percent I I like to when I set

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,270
up build environments I like to set them

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,850
up in separate some things right so a

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,610
separate machine vagrant you know

00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,110
VirtualBox whatever docker because I'd

00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,460
put tons of stuff in my local

00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,140
workstation and I like to have like

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,450
really predictable results from builds

00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,250
so I set up vagrant to do my builds

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,630
right so what you're looking at here on

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,520
the on the left-hand side of the screen

00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,609
this is my vagrant environment and I

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,770
have basically just cloned the 30 the

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:17,119
windows I'm sorry them did I just say

00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:20,210
that they're comin Tomatoes bad crowd

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,419
for that one man want wall I just cloned

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,250
the ESP 32 port a microp I thought to my

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:26,659
vagrant environment then I can go in

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,440
there and I can build stuff it's

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:32,210
important to point out that when I go

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,450
into modules here this is really

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,250
important if you do this you can't write

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,010
your own micro Python put it in this

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,300
modules directory right build your do

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,530
the build like you normally would and

00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,109
anything that's in that modules

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,700
directory will be like a first-class

00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:48,169
module from this Python standard library

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,580
like when yours when your system comes

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,320
up if

00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,000
modules written right that'll just work

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,100
you won't have to import anything or use

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,350
micro pip or anything to get the or

00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,550
transfer files so it'll compile down to

00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,960
bytecode when you do the build and it'll

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,100
be available for you on your bot on your

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,920
system when you bring it up so that's a

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:06,700
neat little trick that is very helpful

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,900
so in order to do the build we first I

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,090
would make sure obviously that I don't

00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,260
have a previous build and then there's a

00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,420
and I'll show you where I got this from

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,180
there's a little one-liner that I run

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,650
that passes what I need to GCC and then

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,910
it builds I'm sure many of you have seen

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,500
GCC even if you're not a developer

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,880
you've built something because it's a

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,140
Linux conference and we do that stuff

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,500
we'd love to build things from scratch

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,000
all the time that's what Linux people do

00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,310
so I'll quickly just show you where I

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,650
got that from those instructions are

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:37,360
here yeah so on the ESP 32 port there's

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,650
a step-by-step how to set up the

00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,360
environment I just did it in vagrant

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,040
that's the only difference you can do it

00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,670
on VirtualBox you can do it on another

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,930
VM you can do it in docker then I set up

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,460
the environment in the tool chain I did

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,020
all this set up the environment

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,000
variables and then I built the firmware

00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,140
right so we don't you guys can again

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,990
I'll put this in the repo so you can get

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,700
to these links if you want to so that's

00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:01,060
how you build micro Python and that's

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,540
going to produce for us a single bin

00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,490
file right binary you know almost like a

00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,720
disk image or an OVF that we would put

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:12,400
on so then what we would do is we'd

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,870
flash the board and I'll go back here to

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,580
this terminal on the right hand side is

00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,100
where we would flash the board you see

00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,620
I've got this I've got this firmware dot

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:24,940
bin right here this little guy that's

00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,290
what we would get out of vagrant vagrant

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,570
would produce that build and we get that

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,740
binary file out and this is our little

00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,030
operating system right and remember

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,620
anything we put in modules is going to

00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,820
be baked in here so it's going to carry

00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,880
that with it when we put it on the

00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,290
system the the statement that we run to

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,230
flash the board there's actually two of

00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:44,710
them and again I'll make sure all the

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:46,360
stuff is available for you guys it's

00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,310
actually two of them there's that we

00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,840
need to erase the board here the only

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,790
thing is you would change this to your

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,370
serial connection and then we need to

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,510
flash the board and that's this pretty

00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,920
much the same command except we're going

00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,050
to point it to that forum or that bin

00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,910
that we just got out of vagrant right so

00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,490
we build it we pull it out of vagrant we

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,720
put it on

00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,869
system and then we run these two

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,760
commands if you you probably going to

00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:10,250
need this tool and so I'll show you

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,130
where that is that's here on the ESP

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,600
espresso get repo and where I said

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,320
they're very open and sort of provide

00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,820
tools for the community so that's that

00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,460
that's we get ESP tool it's just it's

00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,320
just a little Python pip install if you

00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:29,180
used to Python use pip to install it and

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,850
then it's really easy to use so that is

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,290
how we connect how we flashed the board

00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,760
so after we get our board flashed you're

00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,840
gonna want to connect to it and like

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,640
work with it

00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,040
so what you do then is you would just

00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,740
find a power source it works off USB I'm

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,860
just going to connect it to my board to

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,300
my laptop and it works just like that

00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,630
plug it in and now I should have a

00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:54,860
serial connection so I'll just open up

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:56,060
another terminal window and now I should

00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,660
get I'll make this big for you guys cuz

00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,080
I realize you probably can't see it here

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,800
we go

00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,950
and then I'll connect to it hey look at

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,170
that

00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,510
micro Python on a tiny tiny little

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,980
computer and this never gets old for me

00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:14,060
like I always feel like Bob Ross when

00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:16,430
I'm doing this like oh that's my guy

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,810
you're awake you know that's just now

00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,700
every time it happens I'm just like that

00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,180
that feels awesome right because I mean

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,760
think about it

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,050
you know I'm have a serial connection

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,550
forget the rest of the board I have a

00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,440
serial connection to just this little

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,140
chip right here right I'm running Python

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,910
I can do anything I want to that I can

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,740
do with Python it's really fun and

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,420
exciting so that's our repple connection

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,760
and we can do something like you know oh

00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,380
we don't want that print

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,970
we're in Python 3 so it's Python 3

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:48,650
syntax and we're oh hi oh that's what it

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,980
looks like not very interesting but

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,080
we'll do more here in a minute so now

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,780
we've we've built our code we flashed

00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,330
our board we connected serial and we've

00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,920
seen the the repple prompt so now let's

00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:02,420
look at this little helper library that

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,400
I've built so I didn't want to bore you

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,020
guys with like a bunch of typing right

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,600
because a I probably would mess it up

00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,609
you know because it's live and I always

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,080
get it wrong and then the repple those

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:13,790
of you who've worked in a live repple if

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,240
you get it wrong like three steps down

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,610
you got to start

00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,590
again so it's it's just it's like asking

00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,970
for trouble and I didn't want trouble so

00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:26,310
what I did was I wrote this little

00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,750
library where are you library yeah so

00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,050
what it does it does all kinds of stuff

00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,490
when when the board comes up it will try

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,450
to connect to Wi-Fi so I gave it the

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:38,430
Wi-Fi connection to my phone it will

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,020
enable the access point it has its own

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:42,660
Wi-Fi access point so if they can't get

00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,190
on organic Wi-Fi it will spin up its own

00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,660
AP that I can then connect to to do

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,020
stuff if I don't have a serial

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,180
connection

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,520
it also has remember that temp that Hall

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,050
that touch SEC that's touch sensors I

00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,430
made some little helper functions for

00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,230
that so you don't have to watch me type

00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,430
all that stuff and then we can read all

00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,770
of them if we want and we can toggle

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,330
LEDs on and off with these little helper

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,100
functions and again I'll make all this

00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,510
stuff available to you guys so let's

00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,060
just do that real fast

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,740
let's do and I attained iam is just the

00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,660
name of this board I could have very

00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,910
easily called this board you know called

00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,580
it board or whatever it's gonna pay any

00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,260
attention to that will do I attained iam

00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,100
so this LED is this this went up in the

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,050
upper right here I think you could

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:21,900
probably just barely see it it's

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:25,770
currently on so what I want to do is I

00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:30,570
want to turn it off and I'll hold it up

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:36,660
and you'll get to see it go off and then

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:40,640
I can make it go back on yeah and then

00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,340
we can do this it's going on and off

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,900
nice ok so now we can manipulate the LED

00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:48,720
and we can also to have this one that we

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,160
can do I attained iam dot blink and this

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,440
takes two arguments we can tell it to

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,070
blink for like a 500 millisecond delay

00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,490
for 10 seconds right and that should

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:02,520
start to go there it goes see a blinking

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,980
yeah and then what else can we do with

00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,930
this we have the sensors that we can

00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,240
read I just get out of this 10 seconds

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,500
was too long it really bothers me that

00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,480
the repple does not have a clear

00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,920
function like real Python DOS so I have

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,119
to get I get all the way who who else is

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,990
like that like everything is like do

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,400
something do something clear do

00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,290
something do something clear right I

00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,080
have that promise this just really

00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,520
drives me nuts so let's look at some of

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,140
these sensors now remember it's got a

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,790
temperature sensor a Hall effect sensor

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,540
and a capacitive touch sensor so let's

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,350
try all three

00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,550
will do I attained iam temp and again

00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:33,900
this is just wrapping up the

00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,400
functionality the native functionality

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,720
of the board and there are little helper

00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,500
functions it's all in here for you to

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,010
see how it's done

00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,210
closer to the metal if you want and that

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:46,070
will give us this temperature reading of

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:48,330
127 we can also do I attained iam Hall

00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,430
which will give us our Hall effect our

00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:54,420
Hall effect sensor reading at one star

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:58,950
which is currently 82 and then we can do

00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:00,420
I attained iam dot touch right which is

00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,340
currently 645 now what I'm going to do

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,470
is I'm going to touch a pin the one that

00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,570
is tied to that capacitive touch I'm

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,400
going to run it again and it goes drops

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,590
down to 12 right so now we could write

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:23,600
code that says when a threshold is below

00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:23,600
100 what's that I sure can

00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:32,880
got you so so yeah there's there it is

00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,320
without touching it 6:45

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,760
whatever that means that that's just the

00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,440
value that the sensor reads and I touch

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:43,590
it and wow look at that there we go

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,030
four so we could you could see where we

00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,410
could use that in code to sort of set

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,540
thresholds for what's or Eve see also

00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,040
seen people like maybe a sign touch to

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,930
lots of pins and then put fruit attached

00:42:50,040 --> 00:43:02,760
fruit to it with with cables and then do

00:42:51,930 --> 00:43:04,380
like a little keyboard yes so the temp

00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,420
is just a raw value off the sensor it's

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,100
not not a Fahrenheit or Celsius reading

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,660
but you just have to sort of core it's a

00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,930
linear correlation so you just have to

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,330
build that into your code

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:18,120
no no it's hard it's hard coded in the

00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:21,360
in the chip yes you could calibrate it

00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,330
but you'd have to do it in code okay so

00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,800
that's um those are the sensors and I

00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:30,360
have this other one - let's do this wing

00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,280
this while true we'll do I attained iam

00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:37,020
dot read all and they'll give us all the

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,830
sensors there you go so this is fun so

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,020
we can see I'll do the Hall effect

00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:42,150
sensor you can see Hall at its normal

00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,790
state is around 80 I'm a magnet in my

00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:49,860
wallet so put this on here and we see

00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:51,840
Hall drops down to Hall jumps up to 225

00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,610
there when I put a magnet on it

00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,020
put a more powerful magnet which is over

00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,400
here I can get it negative reading so

00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,620
basically the Hall effect sensor is in

00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,210
the middle and one polarity will pull it

00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,390
high and the other polarity will pull it

00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:05,010
in low even negative if we put the right

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,570
the right amount on it so I'll try to

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,970
get the temp to go up the temp currently

00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,850
is saying 128 I'll put my finger on it

00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:14,070
and see if I can get it to go to 129 I

00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,110
sometimes I can get one that's going

00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,450
down yeah it's a really really really

00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,860
bad sensor I have held I have held a

00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,840
lighter to it and I can make that work

00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,580
but I thought that's probably wouldn't

00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,960
be appropriate you know you get one of

00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,960
those Elon Musk flamethrowers

00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:35,120
yeah so that's all the readings come in

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,480
through it once in real time as fast as

00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,950
we can do it so that's fun but it's not

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,390
really IOT right this is more like

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:43,250
hobbyist like we're just reading sensors

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,050
it's wired to my system like we want to

00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:47,810
do something meaningful with this and

00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,740
and in order to do that we we can't do

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,770
that in the repple we're going to need

00:44:48,740 --> 00:45:05,900
some code so I have this very very very

00:44:51,770 --> 00:45:07,520
simple this is basically their yes they

00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,870
are the functions that I'm using in my

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,640
code or on the firmware because I

00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,620
because I put them in that modules

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,960
directory when I did the build that's

00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,790
right there in firmware this code that

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,260
I'm showing you now is not in the build

00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:22,850
this code is on my local system that I

00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,430
just you know again this is just an MQTT

00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:27,410
client and qtt is a messaging protocol

00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,030
for its well-suited for IOT and this is

00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:31,970
how we're gonna get our messages to AWS

00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,080
to our endpoint and so in 25 lines and I

00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,610
could have done it unless if I combine

00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,050
these two I don't have any error

00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,090
handling in here I don't have any object

00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,470
orientation nothing nice this is just

00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,200
sort of like hello world to prove the

00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,970
concept simply we're going to take this

00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,000
test up high and I've already got it on

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:51,830
the board for you and we're going to

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,700
import it and run it okay so this that

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,110
let me just walk through it one more

00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,480
time that script that I just showed you

00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:58,220
on my local system that has the MQTT

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,750
client and I'll walk you through it I

00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,190
should probably do that real fast what

00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,610
it does is it makes a connection it

00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:07,430
establishes the thing ID as the the CPU

00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,990
gooood for this device so that we can

00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,510
have some you know so we're not naming

00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:13,250
collisions up in AWS it establishes the

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,440
endpoint that's the DNS host name of the

00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,720
thing the place I'm sending this data it

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,640
reads to cert files a private key and

00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,780
assert that I put on this board so that

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,100
we can authenticate remember that

00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,970
authentication node and the thing that

00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,190
we're building that's how we're doing

00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,680
that and then it creates a client object

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,540
using the mqtt library which is also on

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,640
the board and then it connects once it's

00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,290
connected it's going to sleep for a

00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,640
second and then it's going to take all

00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,040
three of those readings again just like

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,280
we did a second ago

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,350
it's going to take them quietly and

00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:45,550
munch them into JSON and send it to to

00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,900
AWS okay so we take that file we put it

00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,160
on the board when I did that for you

00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,630
already we're gonna do that in a second

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,070
so you can see how it's done and then

00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,450
it's doing it in the background because

00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,590
I don't have any logging output because

00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:57,430
I was trying to keep it simple so if we

00:46:53,590 --> 00:47:00,130
go over to AWS now to the dashboard and

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:04,270
we subscribe to that mqtt topic which

00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:05,800
today for this event is high Linux we

00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,530
will see those values are coming through

00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,170
right now if you look right sort of here

00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:12,880
you'll see that timestamp changing right

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,200
right there you can see it changing you

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,109
don't see the values changing too much

00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,640
because I'm not changing them but let me

00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:21,760
just do that real fast with the Hall

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:26,500
effect sensor first you'll see the

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:30,250
values change up in AWS so now Hall is

00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,369
dropping to 79 now it's down to 30

00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:36,609
negative 34 right we can also do the

00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:38,230
touch sensor try my hand here and touch

00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:39,790
the right pin and you see the touch

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,280
sensor is now dropping to 70 no we're

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,890
looking at this value right here all

00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,770
right that's gonna change 645 in its

00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,150
normal state now it's down to 12 all

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,100
right and now this is no longer on my

00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,080
system this is happening up in the cloud

00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:57,310
this is just the backend that we're

00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:00,130
sending it to yes sir the cost is

00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,390
negligible for this it's you can look at

00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,880
the pricing I don't know it off the top

00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,650
of my head honestly because I work for a

00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,119
partner that that does a lot of work for

00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,220
aw so we get this stuff for free and I

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,170
really pay attention to the pricing it's

00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,240
it's but for this service I can tell you

00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,520
it's it's negligible it's going to be

00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,470
pennies on the dollar to like spinning

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,670
up your own instances in your own mqtt

00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,670
server yes sir

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:37,180
yep so what I'm gonna do now is I'm

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,500
going to I'm gonna fire up the web

00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,809
repple and I remember repple is this

00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,299
this console that we're in but they also

00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:44,470
have a web version of that and I'll show

00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:47,980
you where you can get it and then I'm

00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:50,020
going to make sure I have it started and

00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:54,460
that will give me this value right here

00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:56,049
is what I'm after so this is the end

00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,829
point for web repple and web rep Oh

00:48:56,049 --> 00:49:01,720
again is here there it's on the micro

00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:02,890
Python site you can download it thank

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,630
you very much sir

00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,710
you can download it and it's like you

00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,880
can think of it like a clot you don't

00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,950
have to go to a website you can just

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,839
download this to your local system clone

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,000
this go to an HTML file you can think of

00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:14,290
it like a little binary client to always

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,180
get on your system in fact that's how I

00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,920
manage that little one that doesn't have

00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,319
a serial connector the one that's just a

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,549
chip I flash it with an FTDI cable and

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,809
put web Ruppel on and have it start

00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:24,339
automatically and then I always just

00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:26,680
interface with it and program it over

00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:28,210
the web ripple and so you would just

00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,000
open this HTML and that's what I have

00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:34,809
over here and so if I take that file

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:39,670
that I or that um that value you gonna

00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:41,950
put it in here I get a password perfect

00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,460
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going

00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:47,740
to upload a file called main PI now main

00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:51,280
dot pi is nothing more than test dot pi

00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,780
renamed send it to the device you see

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,920
I've got and this is why doing this over

00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,630
serials a real pain in the butt because

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,750
I have to stop my serial connection and

00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,339
then transfer the file so now main dot

00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,780
pi is on the device and what should

00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:04,119
happen this is now we're gonna make a

00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,240
real IOT things right what should happen

00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:09,460
is when I power this thing back up micro

00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,140
Python is gonna boot microphone is gonna

00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,000
call its boot PI which has sort of

00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,109
environment set up Wi-Fi connection that

00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,579
source whatever you want to put in there

00:50:14,109 --> 00:50:17,740
and then it's going to run main dot pi

00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:19,329
that's what it's designed to do and so

00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:22,109
and if things are going right I should

00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:23,859
be able to pass this around the room and

00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:25,930
do me a favor

00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:27,160
make sure your hands are dry like wipe

00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,140
them on your shirt before you touch the

00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,369
pins the pins are right here sort of

00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,510
near the green just touch them off

00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:33,440
you'll but just really kind of brush

00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,819
them and do please wipe your finger

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,119
otherwise it'll do that little error

00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:40,040
that it threw earlier so now hopefully

00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:43,190
this goes well we'll have a real IOT

00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,170
device and you'll be able to see the

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:48,079
values change which you'll need me to do

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,430
here there you go Devin so do the and

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,170
also give me my wallet so you can do it

00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,359
up there's the touch sensor drop into 24

00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:56,060
and then back up to 644 and again we're

00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:00,290
looking at these values here if it makes

00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,550
it easier for you guys to see these are

00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,890
the values you want to look at as

00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:06,530
they're changing and here's here's the

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,390
bat magnet if you want to also test the

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,369
Hall effect sensor just hold either of

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,750
these magnets or one here one here hold

00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:13,099
it right up next to the tin can and

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,780
you'll get to change the Hall affection

00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:16,430
so let's just pass that around so now we

00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,589
have a real IOT thing right it's it's

00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:20,390
unplugged and has its own code and you

00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:21,589
can imagine how you could build

00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:25,069
something that you could do whatever you

00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:27,680
wanted to do and and disconnect it and

00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:30,349
cut it loose and now you have real ilt

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,960
so where do you go from here if this

00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:34,310
interests you and I hope it does go

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,050
watch this video I'll give you my deck

00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,790
so you can get to this link go watch

00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:40,310
Nick Moore's talk Nick is a primary

00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:42,980
contributor to the ESP 32 port of micro

00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:45,050
Python this video really inspired me to

00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,480
get more sort of involved with this

00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,490
project Nick does a great job of

00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,310
explaining how you can contribute to the

00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:53,869
ESP 32 port micro Python for someone who

00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,030
might like me who's not a C programmer

00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:57,650
and doesn't really want to be he really

00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,990
sort of gets you excited about like how

00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:01,970
you can take functionality that doesn't

00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,560
exist in micro Python for the SP 32 and

00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,420
make it work and if you who like to

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,859
contribute to open source projects go

00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,950
watch Nick's video he's a really cool

00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:11,480
smart cool guy he's wicked smart and if

00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,700
anything you'll learn something but

00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,500
maybe even get excited about

00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:19,490
contributing to microphone on the ESP 3G

00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:21,800
so that's my talk about IOT in the open

00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,089
source space hope you guys liked it we

00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,099
have just a few minutes left that we can

00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:26,630
do Q&A if you want and I'm happy to do

00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,980
that and then of course after they kick

00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,319
me out if you have any questions we can

00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:34,960
talk on the side so any questions or

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,960
comments yes sir

00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,810
so that's where you absolutely yeah

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,070
could you and especially in your home

00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:56,000
right like that's a good example if

00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,740
you're just if you just want to build

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,360
something in your house you can set up

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,180
your own in queue in fact many of the

00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,100
open-source home automation like

00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,410
projects there's two really big ones

00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,930
there they were 8 just like that

00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:10,760
so home automation is a strange space

00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,630
because that's the one place where you

00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,400
would want to kind of keep your network

00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,020
private and you won't have millions and

00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,370
tens of thousands of things and you

00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,870
might want to hack on your own little

00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,300
thing in that case you would just

00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,910
install an open-source MQTT server like

00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,010
like mosquito or install one of the home

00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,440
automation things that also work on MQTT

00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,090
and then just use that so that's a great

00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,510
example of when you would not do what I

00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,940
said

00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,780
but for enterprise IOT solutions

00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,370
building them anywhere but in the cloud

00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:43,580
is basically asking your competitors to

00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:49,280
eat you for lunch yep yes sir I don't

00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:51,350
know I just know MQTT I've seen a zero

00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,820
MQL here and there you know once I find

00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,140
something that works I just kind of

00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,940
blaze ahead and go on the next thing so

00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,130
I don't I don't that didn't get too deep

00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,000
into that the messaging space so I don't

00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:03,380
know and I'm not going to give you a

00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,900
full answer right why don't you find out

00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:12,760
and come back and teach us do a session

00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:12,760
next year yeah ok yes sir

00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:22,720
so I haven't built a lot I just got into

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,849
it about I got into about I know three

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,069
or four years ago I've built a lot of

00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:28,660
hobbyist systems just like that

00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:30,099
minecraft thing I built a lot of that

00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,519
kind of stuff on that chip and Arduino

00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:33,039
chips

00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:34,749
it wasn't till about two years ago where

00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:38,109
my work sort of thrust me into those

00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:40,359
places that I started building building

00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:42,839
more enterprise solutions I see Scott

00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:50,499
back there I mean I got five minutes

00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:54,309
okay okay so yeah I really haven't built

00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:56,380
a lot myself but it's something that I

00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:57,670
got thrust into at work and so got

00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,410
really interested in so when I head up

00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,690
when Scott and Werner asked me to come

00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,249
speak I wanted to do something different

00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:04,690
that I hadn't done before and so it kind

00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:05,710
of said you know I gave him three topics

00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:07,869
and they said hey let's do this IOT

00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,619
thing so I really have not built a lot

00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:15,670
maybe I don't know two dozen right most

00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:17,140
of them hobbyist type stuff but the the

00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,369
information I share about how we do it

00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:25,089
in the enterprise is because that's what

00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:26,319
I do in my day job more questions you

00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:28,660
guys really really really wanna go the

00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,920
bathroom oh you don't have to wait for

00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,049
me to like say maybe you're all like

00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,220
free grown-ups go where you want when

00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:39,809
you want so go to the bathroom yes sir

00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,809
two questions you in front yes sir

00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:48,849
so satellite is definitely a failover

00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:52,900
that we will design into systems that

00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:55,680
need it you'll give me a use case that

00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,680
won't have Wi-Fi

00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,450
yeah so in the ocean so in the ocean

00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:02,950
what we in fact we're building a

00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,470
solution like this for ship tracking

00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,930
shipping containers the ocean will we'll

00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:10,329
just aggregate data and and you know do

00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,799
it when we get to ends right the ports

00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:13,180
but if you need to have real-time data

00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,980
in the ocean then you need to solve for

00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,240
that so if the shipping company's not

00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,130
going to give you access to their

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,079
onboard Wi-Fi then you got a strap a

00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:42,910
satellite somewhere on that boat right

00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:44,140
yes sir yeah it definitely I don't I

00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,640
don't mean to cut you off and I think

00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,109
Ike this is probably the last question I

00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,160
can answer so I got to drop off cuz

00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:53,380
Scott's gonna come stomp my head but yes

00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,140
absolutely there is nothing more

00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:58,539
scalable than lambda so lambda is lambda

00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,619
is AWS is serverless compute thing we

00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:02,019
didn't talk about it much today because

00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:03,220
that's you know it's it's commercial but

00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,869
to answer your question it is highly

00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,269
scalable a thousand concurrent

00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:09,339
executions per region 15 regions per

00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:11,470
account fifteen thousand times two cores

00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:13,450
30,000 concurrent executions without

00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:17,079
ever raising your service limit don't

00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,160
ask me how I know that finding those

00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:22,990
things out is how you get your account

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:24,190
shut down for like three days all right

00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,779
so I won't ask any other questions

00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,710
because I think we got to be respectful

00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,680
in the next group and thank you guys

00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:33,420
very much appreciate it

00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,420
