my apps benefited from other people's

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,960
software which made my programs many

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,760
many times better than anything I could

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,740
write on my own

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,680
and this is what made me see the power

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:33,610
of open source and really understand the

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:36,340
value of open source at a young age why

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,500
would you want to learn Linux well

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,180
Lennox gives you a better understanding

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,720
of what's happening under the hood of

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,820
your computer system and it makes you a

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:51,760
more productive programmer and a more

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,440
hands-on computer user you can't really

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,449
know what is going on behind closed

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,449
source applications running on your

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:01,690
computer because you can't see or audit

00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:04,180
the source code so a lot of times you

00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:09,729
could be running potentially malicious

00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:14,170
or nefarious apps or code and you are

00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:17,590
unaware so why would you want to learn

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:19,450
about the history of Linux well learning

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,000
what the history of Linux gives you a

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:25,270
good appreciation for the people and the

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,539
ideas behind Linux and the open source

00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:34,720
movement and understanding the ideas

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:38,020
behind lens will help you understand why

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,149
Linux is so powerful and it's such a

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:45,459
robust and flexible operating system

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:48,190
today so how many here know the history

00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,640
of Linux or some understanding of the

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,640
history of

00:01:51,509 --> 00:02:00,640
how many to understand the history of

00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:03,009
units all right well to understand the

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,710
history of Linux it's a good idea to

00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:13,000
start with the history of units because

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:18,000
Linux was inspired by Unix UNIX was an

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,680
operating system created back in 1969 by

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,980
two guys at the bell laboratory research

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,760
division of eighteen it was created by

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,340
Dennis Ritchie who is also the creator

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,930
of the C programming language and Ken

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:41,349
Thompson and they set out to create an

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:47,680
operating system that was easy to use

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:50,920
and basically easy to use the operating

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,099
systems at the time were complex they

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,670
were not very user-friendly and these

00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:00,160
guys wanted to reverse the trend so I'm

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,430
going to play you a short clip from AT&T

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,769
archives are these to explain their

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,370
motives behind that UNIX operating

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,370
system

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,630
back in 1969

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,550
a couple of computer scientists here at

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,210
Bell Labs started to develop some

00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,730
programs than unit for their own use

00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,770
what Ken Thompson Dennis Ritchie started

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,600
developing them is evolved into the UNIX

00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,450
operating systems which defined the only

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,860
white leaders around the world we are

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,650
trying to make recruiting as simple as

00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:39,140
possible and the late 1960s Dennis

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,120
Ritchie and I realized within current

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,550
operating systems are much too complex

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,860
we attempted to reverse this trend but

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:52,430
building a small simple operating system

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:57,010
one of the reserve was good the

00:03:52,430 --> 00:04:00,430
environment programming system community

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,430
we knew from experience

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,550
supplied by the road access time-sharing

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,400
systems is not just a type programs into

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,190
the terminal itself a key part but to

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,080
encourage close communication the unique

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,450
system started out as a two-man effort

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,360
and by now it's used all over our lives

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,120
but he had close to 20,000 computer car

00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,820
bugs in this company

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,590
roughly one for employee and most of

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,930
them are used for communicating with

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,760
UNIX systems one of the main reasons to

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,380
the UNIX system is popular around here

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,330
is because it provides graceful

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,220
facilities for decomposing and complex

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:42,110
computing tasks into simple some tasks

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,050
the UNIX operating system is basically

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,470
made up of three parts the kernel or

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,800
operating system proper is the part that

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,900
manages the control of the Machine

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,980
supervise the scheduling of various

00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,870
different programs the shell or which is

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,330
the name we give to the

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:08,710
looks after the communication between

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,419
the user and the system itself the third

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,780
part which is actually the largest is

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:16,120
the various utility programs which

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,979
perform specific tasks like editing a

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,620
file or sorting on a bunch of numbers or

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:26,440
making apply the words all the other

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,990
programs that are not provided directly

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,129
as part of the operating system kernel

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,129
[Music]

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,650
so what UNIX pioneered was the

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,710
philosophy and the implementations of a

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,320
simple easy-to-use operating system that

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,110
consisted of a kernel which was the core

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,570
of the operating system a shell which

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,880
was the command interpreter and a user

00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:00,330
would type commands and interact with

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,330
the system and utilities or applications

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:09,090
so UNIX becomes very popular in the 70s

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:17,280
and 80s but the source code for UNIX is

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:20,380
closed off it's a proprietary system so

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,039
in the 80s there was a man named Richard

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:28,169
Stallman as shown here

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:31,780
he's a very eccentric eccentric man and

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:35,740
he wanted to create a unix-like

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,960
operating system that was free and open

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,659
source where people could change the

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:46,419
code and use the code as as they saw

00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:49,690
please grip some limitations and he sets

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:53,050
out to start a project called the canoe

00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:56,800
project which is G and U which stands

00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:03,150
for canoe is not Unix and he does this

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:08,380
in 1984 and he's my mission to rewrite

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:10,580
UNIX software completely from scratch to

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,520
be open source

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:17,070
and he is seen as the philosopher behind

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,550
the open-source movement and free

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:24,480
software so he begins the canoe project

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:28,500
in 1984 and he also establishes the Free

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:31,200
Software Foundation in 1985 which helps

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:37,140
facilitate the development of the canoe

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:39,630
tools he also creates the GPL license

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,600
which is the general public license that

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,290
is used to help protect free software

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,560
from being misused and to help free

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,290
software continue to be free so now I

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:58,710
will play a clip about Richard Stallman

00:07:52,290 --> 00:08:02,910
and the canoe project this clip is from

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,070
the documentary revolution OS which is a

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:12,830
great documentary that you can find on

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:15,150
the Internet Richard Stallman was doing

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,590
artificial intelligence research and

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,020
coding at the MIT artificial

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:21,150
intelligence lab Richard had a number of

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,520
negative experiences during that period

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,600
which soured him on the whole idea of

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,120
commercial software so company wanted to

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,210
work on and what the fix was locked up

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:42,990
and he couldn't get the company that of

00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:46,160
the code to fix it to get one of the

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,740
modern computers of the day which was

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,350
you have to get a proprietary operating

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,000
system developers of those system with

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,850
Dennis share with other people instead

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,759
they try to control these expiring users

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,500
respect them saying is to get this

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,569
system you have to sign a promise we

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,060
work share with anybody else

00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:07,759
and to me that was essentially a promise

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,649
to being a bad person to betray the rest

00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:14,060
in the world cut myself off from society

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,949
from the cooperating community and I

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,750
over the experience what happened what

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,459
other people did that to us when they

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,250
refused to share with us because they

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,800
didn't sign these contracts and hurt the

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,819
whole does for me doing useful things

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,009
before so I just wasn't going to do that

00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:34,490
I thought this is war I am NOT going to

00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:36,769
live this way and from experiences like

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,810
this he developed a profound hostility

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,420
to the idea of intellectual property and

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:44,889
software now eventually acted this out

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,889
the free software foundation

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:56,230
if I were to develop another operating

00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:58,000
system and then one third encourage

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,430
everyone to share a sample when you

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,700
coming in it use this form a new

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:06,130
community not only could I give myself

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,260
away to keep using computers without

00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,690
betraying other people but I don't give

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,589
it to everybody else to everybody they

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,540
have a way out of that moral dilemma and

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,750
so I draw is this was what I had to do

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,019
with my life actually began the project

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:25,870
in January of 1984 that's been designed

00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:29,740
for my job at MIT to start developing

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,510
the new operating system now I should

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,310
explain that the name the new name is a

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:39,100
hack because it's a recursive acronym it

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,019
stands for you know it's not Unix

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,350
you see so the G of you know who stands

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,600
for you know and what the name is is I

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,839
was developed in a system that was like

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,790
the UNIX operating system but was not

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,950
the UNIX operating system this was in a

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,079
different system we have to write it

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:58,300
completely from scratch because you miss

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,550
with proprietary we were forbidden to

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:04,660
share humans we could easily mix it was

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,339
useless for our community so we had to

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,380
write a replacement for it

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,730
without the 1980s as Richard Stallman

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,889
was building the commuter project

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,630
computer scientists from the University

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,040
of California at Berkeley we're

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,970
developing their own free operating

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,800
system known as Berkeley UNIX or BSD it

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,529
was based upon the UNIX kernel which had

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,449
been licensed from atm teeth however due

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,790
to legal problems with a TMT and

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:31,740
fragmentation of the source code hackers

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,430
and other non institutional users were

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,920
slow to adopt it well consisted of a

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,199
large number of separate programs that

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,360
communicated with each other so we just

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,490
had to replace these programs one by one

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:51,870
so when I started doing was writing

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:53,970
replacement program announcement

00:11:51,870 --> 00:12:08,900
inviting other people to join me to

00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:11,600
override these programs you need to

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,040
[Music]

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,290
allocate resources to all the other

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,570
programs we need a compiler which

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,570
translates a program from

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,149
into numbers mysterious you notice that

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:34,519
the Commissioner can actually run do

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:37,889
this job of her you have standard for

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:48,089
matters lots and lots of things there

00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:51,059
are programs 1987 he came to give a

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,579
five-day tutorial on Emacs at our

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:56,040
company and during the day he would

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,709
explain new ways to think about Emacs

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,199
and ways to extend an intensity use the

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,600
Emacs source code for better or worse

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:06,029
but in the evening he was he was busily

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,610
working on this compiler and he had not

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:12,029
yet released it to the public so he was

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,649
being a little bit careful about who who

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,439
got to see the source code but I was

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,910
very eager and when he first announced

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,610
it in June and I downloaded it

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,769
immediately I I played with it I got

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,809
some some pointers from him and when I

00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:28,110
said the search go back to him he was

00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:30,110
brief actually amazed at how quickly I

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,089
was able to ramp up by his technology

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:36,209
whenever we worked on something at

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:37,889
Stanford or in the university we would

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,689
get mostly at the time we were working

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,389
off of machines from digital equipment

00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,610
or son mostly something whenever we get

00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,629
a Sun machine the first thing we would

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,059
do is we would spend literally days

00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,369
downloading to do free software from the

00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:55,829
internet building and installing it on

00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:58,980
that Sun machine the crucial thing about

00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:01,679
the new is that it's free software free

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,340
software refers not to price but to free

00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:09,130
to go to free speech not creepy

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,040
I'm talking about my freedoms to make

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,960
changes if you want to or hire somebody

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,450
else to make changes for you if you're

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,910
using the software for your business to

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:22,000
redistribute copies to share with other

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,010
people and to make the improvements and

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,700
publish them so other people can get the

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:30,460
benefit of them to distinguish free

00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,440
software from non-free software these

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,700
are the freedoms that enable people to

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:57,040
form a community if you don't have one

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:58,690
and dominated by somebody well the free

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,550
software foundation under Richard

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,270
Stallman had created a great tool called

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,760
mice

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,180
I needed a tool that worked with see Fox

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,410
Fox bison work to see I modified bison

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,780
to create something called fights and

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,300
buzz buzz as a tremendous feeling of

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,900
empowerment to be able to take a piece

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,880
of software that was available and

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,550
created in a very short piece of time by

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,120
modifying and put it back on the

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,980
Internet

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,870
and I was amazed at the number of people

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,740
that picked it up and started using it

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,570
in fact I remember going to a job

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,550
interview site in various times

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,770
considered just going out getting a job

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,150
and I got into a job interview and I was

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,710
talking with one of the people and I

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,589
started asking them about what tools

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:44,290
they use and they said we use by c plus

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:48,190
plus and I'm the author of buys the bus

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:51,880
bus free software generally does have a

00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,930
copyright it does have an owner and it

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,400
has a license it is not public domain if

00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,360
we put the sophomore in the public

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,730
domain somebody else

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,290
and they believe the changes and turn

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,629
that into the proprietary software

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,549
package which means that the users would

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:09,709
be running our software but they

00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:13,040
wouldn't have freedom to cooperate and

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:16,040
share to prevent that we use a technique

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,309
called copyleft the idea of copyleft is

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,350
is copyright flip the world and what we

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,989
do is we say this software is

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,259
copyrighted and we the authors give you

00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:28,730
permission to redistribute copies your

00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,860
permissions are changing if you

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,170
permission to add to it but when you

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,799
redistribute it it has to be under these

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,910
terms no more no less so that whoever

00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,730
gets it from you

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:44,899
also gets the freedom to cooperate with

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,790
other people if he wants to and then in

00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,519
this way everywhere the software goes

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,910
the freedom goes to and it becomes an

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,529
inalienable right to cooperate with

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,529
other people informal community

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,709
a specific example the specific example

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,839
we use for most you know software

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,709
packages is the gnu general public

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,230
license particular document in legalese

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,910
which accomplishes this job a lot of

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,130
other people use that same license for

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,040
example Nina's football news is that

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,689
license for Linux as well

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,880
well the license I use is a good GNU

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:30,140
general public license that's the one

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,690
that Richard Stallman really astounding

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,990
contribution it's one of the few

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:38,390
software licenses that was written from

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,350
the standpoint of the community rather

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:45,950
than from the standpoint of protecting a

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,760
company or as is the case with the MIT

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:53,330
and the BSD license performing the goals

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,390
of a government grant program and the

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:58,310
GPL is really unique in that it's not

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,340
just a license it's a whole philosophy

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:04,730
there I think motivated the open source

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:08,200
definition honey don't hide it a lot of

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,200
what I do came from stolen

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:18,149
so Richard Stallman creates the new

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:20,070
software suite and it gains in the

00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:23,700
popularity gains and popularity

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:27,269
throughout the 80s but the project is

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,149
still missing a kernel and they need the

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:32,789
kernel to complete the new operating

00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:35,309
system so they have all the tools of a

00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,429
unix-like operating system but they're

00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:42,830
missing one crucial aspect of it they

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:45,989
have text editors compilers debuggers

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:50,429
they're missing the heart or the core of

00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:53,909
the operating system so enter - Torvalds

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:58,049
who was a student at Helsinki University

00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:00,269
in Finland and he was just developing an

00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:04,200
operating system kernel for fun he had

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:06,389
no intentions of the kernel becoming

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,149
part of the canoe system which it later

00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:12,330
does become part of the canoe system and

00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:16,259
he famously posts on the internet about

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,590
how he's doing a small project and it's

00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,590
