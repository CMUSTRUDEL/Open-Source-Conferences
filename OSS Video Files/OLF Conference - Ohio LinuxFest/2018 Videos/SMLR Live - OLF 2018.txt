us we have beth and i you know maybe we

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,010
should have talked about it I'm really

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,050
bad at pronouncing so I'm not very clear

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:59,340
last name at sure absolutely not all

00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,690
right we have Susan rose and Dan Vince

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,879
cooking dirt burn I won't make you

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,430
attempt it all right thank you

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:12,500
and we also have Rafiq right Riemann

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,500
come on thank you

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,860
so I guess what we'll start with a

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,040
little bit is a little bit of history

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,439
about Ohio Linux fest and bath you're

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,720
the president right now so and you've

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,360
been around probably the longest that I

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,070
remember seeing people around so I will

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:36,600
let you take that all right fantastic so

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,020
the wild next fest is and always was and

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,909
it from missing section what we call an

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:51,119
inter lug gathering where it really made

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:56,490
sense from the members of the Kenton

00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:00,689
user group to communicate with other

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,000
area logs there was a youngstown log and

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,659
a cleveland log that they were

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,060
particularly chummy with at the time but

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,300
they recognized the pattern that if they

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,820
could actually

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:22,000
all together their excitement and their

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:26,470
resources then they could recruit really

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,220
awesome talent to do a really awesome

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,870
Linux users group meeting and only just

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,870
eliminate someone say year and again the

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:43,860
idea was to have it be a Linux users

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:45,940
group meaning nothing like a big

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:55,210
professional conference which it turns

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:58,690
out to be which it is - so what they

00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:02,910
decided to do is partner with the open

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:11,640
source club at the Ohio State University

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:15,580
to put on a one-day bonanza of Linux

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,550
related talks I think that there was a

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,440
Linux terminal server project people

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:29,260
came down for that and one of the core

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:33,370
developers that was part of the first

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:41,470
initial Mozilla release had spoke at

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:46,870
that and Paul Ferris who was part of the

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:49,390
launch of Linux today that media source

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,170
if you are familiar with that

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:57,280
those were the the core people who made

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:01,150
up the stage from my memory of the first

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,910
Ohio Linux Fest I personally almost did

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:11,019
not go I almost did not go because I was

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:15,220
closing on a house sometime around

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:18,010
September October and I just didn't want

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,470
to take a seat that would otherwise be

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,960
taken by somebody else so I didn't

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,060
register in time for the deadline and

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
then it turned out to be that it was

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,889
going to be available that weekend

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,710
I was working at Carnegie Mellon school

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:40,639
computer science at the time so I sent

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:45,800
the folks in emails saying hi I realize

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,169
I write I didn't get the registration

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,900
deadline but I would very much love love

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,410
love to be able to attend and represent

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,770
Western PA Linux users group well you

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,199
have me well you know when you email

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:04,039
from Carnegie Mellon school of computer

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:08,530
science people pay attention so they

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:14,120
said oh yes absolutely you can attend

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:16,849
the first Ohio nicks fest but you gotta

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,560
do something for me first by you know

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,389
getting me an admission to Carnegie

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,650
Mellon school of computer science

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:29,300
they were just kidding of course but I I

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:32,060
came and I observed and I opened my big

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,430
mouth at the end of the night saying

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,330
well how is it that you can continue to

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,240
put this on and put this on for free

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:46,639
because I want to make sure that this is

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:49,880
a sustainable project well um I kept in

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:56,300
touch with the organizers even though I

00:05:49,880 --> 00:06:00,229
was from Pennsylvania over email and IRC

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,630
and I somehow got sucked into being the

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,590
first treasurer of the Ohio Linux Fest

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:13,400
that's how I got to be on the board of

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:17,630
the Ohio Linux fest and ever since then

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,880
I have been a core fixture and I

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,710
couldn't still consider myself a founder

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,960
of the Ohio Linux fest because it's

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:33,590
quite um the movement that is inspired

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:36,889
not only other Linux festivals but other

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,650
technical conferences all around and

00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:42,379
it's just

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,300
and complete honor and the privilege to

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,000
be able to serve the community in this

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,460
capacity so thank you thank you for

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,689
coming and attending and having us on

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,229
the show yeah yeah definitely I think

00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,229
this is awesome

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:03,349
yeah if the history is history you know

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,800
I I went to the second one and I

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:10,219
remember during a little bit about you

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,740
know it started off and then it was was

00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,620
the second one the first one at the

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,819
convention hall of the convention was it

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:23,080
called Town Center era Columbus the

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:27,729
second one was at the Hyatt Regency

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:33,639
Columbus which is situated and the

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:37,129
Greater Columbus Convention Center area

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,529
which it also has its own convention

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,039
space and is connected under the same

00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,219
roof

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,919
so it it's rather ambiguous sometimes as

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:50,210
to which building you're standing in in

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,870
any given time but the second Ohio land

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,860
expressed was not in fact at the Ohio

00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:01,610
State University because the student

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:06,080
group that put it on say very

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:08,960
successfully the first year was not able

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,370
to execute on booking the room in a

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,800
timely fashion and that's when I had to

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:25,610
do a lot of scrambling and a lot of

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:28,789
begging and even a six-page email to

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,000
John mad dog hall asking for a grant

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:36,199
from Linux International to see if

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,680
there'd be any availability for some

00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:42,349
cash assistance to make sure that the

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:48,260
second annual Heil and exbest was going

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:52,370
to be a go due to how we didn't

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,740
necessarily plan to be

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,550
a situation where we would have to cough

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,390
up money to reserve a venue but now

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,670
because we've been doing it for so long

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:09,760
we have the financial security to say

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:14,630
yes not only will we be able to perform

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:20,510
at the same levels but we will continue

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:23,930
to perform by bringing more guests to

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:28,810
the state of Ohio and the City of

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:33,920
Columbus we will continue to perform by

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,779
bringing new speakers and new ideas to

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,150
the Ohio Linux fests and new attendees

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,240
and people who have never heard of free

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:44,360
software yeah that's awesome I remember

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,890
they'd sing him a couple times there as

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,850
a speaker and being around John mad dog

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:56,930
and he's always he's a really good guy

00:09:51,850 --> 00:10:01,580
for this yeah yeah well a couple of

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:06,470
times that he had spoke he had issued us

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:13,520
a challenge which was that you got to

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:15,709
bring in a Microsoft user to the

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:22,970
conference and I'm sure that that

00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:25,970
challenge still remains to this day but

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:32,230
if you check out the schedule we have

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:35,920
what I would qualify as a historic event

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:39,560
we have Bridgette crumbled from

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:45,490
Microsoft specifically they as your team

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:50,120
who will be giving a talk about the the

00:10:45,490 --> 00:11:00,320
community around containers and DevOps

00:10:50,120 --> 00:11:04,550
and how you really need to look at in

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:09,370
value community even in 2018 when it

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:13,430
to free software which if you told me

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,380
goodness um 15 years ago when I first

00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,230
got involved in the aisle and expressed

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,899
that we would not only have somebody

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,240
from Microsoft talking about that but

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:28,640
also keen owning I would tell you that

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:33,620
pigs are flying but I we we are in a

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,170
completely new future and I see that all

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,800
around the schedule of the Ohio Linux

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:46,610
fest

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:50,540
and I'm very excited about and that cool

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,529
yeah that's awesome yeah I'm excited

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,800
about it

00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:59,899
I think that's really cool so so this

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,269
year 2018 we are just how many days away

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,880
we're seven days from when the

00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:08,120
convention starts for the Ohio River

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,220
fest and I'm sure you guys have been

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,490
really busy on getting everything

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,200
together and get that going

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,000
is there anything exciting that's

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,520
happening this year that you haven't

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,160
seen in the past or yeah we can start

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:28,579
there

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:32,800
well I'll expand more what I said about

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:38,540
that this is a new future here we've got

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:45,610
talks about several talks about Internet

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,610
of Things tiny single board Linux

00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:56,420
computer vision wallet cryptography

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:58,459
blockchain and also looking even deeper

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:04,850
into the future such as getting kids

00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:11,720
involved with computing all I know I'd

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:15,380
say that this is a a lineup where we are

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,300
not only seeing how far we've come as a

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,300
free software movement but

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:32,310
knowing that there is so so much to do

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:35,940
now with the ubiquity of Linux and so

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:38,570
much to be excited about that and we

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,500
need to keep going with this momentum

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:44,399
yeah yeah I definitely agree and that's

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
one of the reasons I want to do my

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,080
little part on having the podcast just

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,920
to share information and try to convince

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,800
or you know get other people to be part

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,959
of it and I can see you know getting

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,000
kids into it it is really it is

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,670
important and we bring more people in

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,720
and I see a few of the talks coming up

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,020
talking about where's Barry pies and you

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,660
know

00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,120
cartoon animation I can see how that can

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,310
be things that's uh you know interested

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,959
for for kids to be trying out and so

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:22,140
it's two talks coming up personally I do

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,240
a lot with security we're more

00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:29,010
professionally I do I'm a network

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:32,279
security at a hospital so I love sitting

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:36,570
in on the security type talks and I can

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,070
see there's a couple that I'm

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,260
interesting is a social engineering

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:47,730
that's pretty interesting to me and and

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:50,790
you know managing IT security octopus so

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,350
that that you know those are things I'm

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:58,320
really interested in and checking out

00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:01,440
but there's so many talks well I'm going

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,670
to direct your attention to two o'clock

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:11,510
at on Friday there's the compliance

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:15,149
automation with simple so simple source

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:18,630
project based on puppet that automates

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:24,930
the compliance furnace guides such as

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:31,060
the honking and otherwise complexing 853

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:35,889
a for an entire ecosystem whether it be

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:38,589
a lot of on-premise cloud or even a

00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:41,110
hybrid environment or heck even a

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:44,500
high-performance computing system it

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,160
seems like an awesome project to be Oh

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:52,870
worth checking out especially if you've

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,149
got compliance to be concerned about at

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,430
your hospital yeah that does look

00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:58,959
interesting unfortunately I'm not gonna

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,879
be able to take get down there on Friday

hopefully you'll be able to join us so

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,790
one of the things that I'm involved with

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,379
this year in past years I've been I've

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,100
been working on recruiting speakers for

00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:02,199
the main conference this year I decided

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,079
to work on the birds of a feather

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,770
sessions we've traditionally had those

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,559
on on Friday night and we're gonna do

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,429
that again this year starting at 6

00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:21,280
o'clock I'm sorry yeah

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:24,370
6 o'clock and those are it's a pretty

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,020
freeform kind of a thing really the

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,120
intention is for people who are

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,510
interested in a particular topic to get

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:34,720
together and you just kind of be able to

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:38,380
to find one another and and be able to

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,110
discuss that topic some of them can be

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,809
if you want them to be they can be more

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,620
structured and actually have something

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,380
to present

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,049
or it could just be a simple round table

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,299
kind of a thing where you just get you

00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,630
know probably the best example of that

00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:58,200
is there's going to be one on the text

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,919
editor min and and the full description

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:08,049
for that that the guy proposed was vim

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,580
is awesome discuss so you know it we we

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,760
have a really nice lineup we've been

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,950
able to get more sessions this year than

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,450
in the past so we're hoping to to

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,710
generate a little bit more interest in

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:26,830
that we've got a couple that are really

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:28,630
neat that are sort of in a going in a

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,299
little bit different directions so we've

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:36,970
got one one speakers whose works for a

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:40,480
school district and they've been rolling

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,390
out Chromebooks in place of using

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,539
MacBook MacBook Airs and so he's going

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,450
to talk about their experience and how

00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:53,590
Chrome books and other linux desktops

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,779
could be used in education oh yeah I

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,580
love Chromebooks in education it's it's

00:18:55,779 --> 00:18:59,289
so ideal and I and all the

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,350
infrastructure that Google is built

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:05,890
around it for managing notes also is

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,590
ideal yeah yeah and we've had we've had

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,809
some talks in the past about education

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,700
you know using Linux and other open

00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,640
source software education and and that's

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,740
always as you mentioned earlier that's

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,539
the the next generation so we need to

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:26,409
need to reach out to those folks we've

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:27,779
had a generation of people in the Ohio

00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:31,659
Linux Fest

00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:35,409
starting at 2003 with this being the

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:38,860
16th Ohio Linux Fest there's people who

00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:40,570
have grown up in their careers with the

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,090
resources and the friendships that

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:47,649
they've made along the way through Ohio

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:52,299
Linux fest so as we're all getting older

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:55,929
we do need to keep keep the flow with

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:58,240
with new and younger people becoming as

00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,940
excited and his chance with

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,040
open-source software as as the rest of

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:09,070
us have been I just want to shoot up a

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:13,620
picture here of the birds of the feather

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:18,270
that dance was just talking about the

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,270
the burro the births of the feather

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:31,150
sorry I'm sorry about that and then

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:35,320
click copies okay all right I'm sorry no

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:38,830
the purpose of the feather topics are

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:43,030
pretty fascinating there and and they

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:45,820
have nine listed so far and you can

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:48,130
still apply for evaluation of your birds

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:52,110
of a feather topic or come up to the

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:55,930
desk if there's still room available the

00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,590
Friday afternoon before before the birds

00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:01,230
and feather

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:05,140
you cannot go ahead and sign up for

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:08,680
space availability for your group yeah

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:12,420
it's cool so if you go to the new

00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:15,730
section of the webpage you can see that

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,740
that article and hopefully at some point

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,530
we might have a little grid put up on

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:25,180
the schedule page with what's going on

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:26,080
with birds of a feather so I don't want

00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,870
to talk too much about

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:33,340
OLF I because Rafiq is here and he's the

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:35,470
the the chairperson for ofll Phi but I

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,540
imagine the people's heads are going to

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,820
be like so crammed full of great

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,940
information at the end o LF I they may

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:47,110
or they may just want to leave but right

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,330
afterwards there's there's the happy

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,410
hour there's a lightning talk rounds and

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,320
then there's the birds of a feather

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:56,110
opportunity so - please check that out

00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:01,590
before leaving if you're one of the many

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,590
people that have enrolled in OLF I so

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,850
yeah actually I think people would be

00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,850
more energized after attending the oiler

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:18,230
that what I am hoping for hmm

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:22,370
but OLF eye is one of the key areas of

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:24,860
Ohio Linux past I have been working with

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,290
the organisation for past five years but

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,960
for last two years I have been managing

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,370
Ohio Linux past Institute these are the

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,810
training courses that we have on Fridays

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,030
the best thing about these training

00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,460
courses is that these are one day long

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,760
training courses there's a lot of

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:48,110
information that people can absorb in

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,260
one day and we believe that this is

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:54,080
probably the best value for people's

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,230
time and money that we provide very

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,830
affordable price points excellent

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,350
speakers excellent content and we have

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,810
been working very hard to diversify the

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,970
topics so you mentioned you are working

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,200
in information security and related

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:15,760
fields and we actually have three

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,530
courses this year that are related to

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,200
information security as I mentioned we

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,660
are trying to diversify not only have an

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,140
open source but also giving people

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:30,040
options if they want to go for

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:36,740
certifications like CISSP and security

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:39,580
like Linux certifications and at the

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,470
same time giving them the opportunity to

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,050
get a little bit deeper into the areas

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:49,730
that they are looking for so for example

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:52,490
this year we have courses around Lennox

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,090
containers we have courses around bash

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,540
shell programming we are covering a

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:03,200
number of fantastic ethical hacking type

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:06,320
courses and so on and what I am very

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,590
excited about this year is that last

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,240
three years we going this program quite

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:16,790
rapidly we had more than 25% growth last

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,190
year this year we are expecting more

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,470
than 50% growth in this program so that

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,539
shows the quality of

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,750
these courses the affordability of these

00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:29,030
courses and the interest that people are

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,070
taking so I'm very excited I'm a little

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,100
bit disappointed you are coming Friday

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,770
evening I wish you could come Friday

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,650
morning so I know I you can stick with

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:43,039
one of those courses and see you know

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:46,039
the quality of the material as well as

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,440
the speakers I'm looking at that list

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,210
now and I'm thinking my boss might cover

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,720
one of those so maybe I will be there on

00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,679
Friday morning so the is a mini boot

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,270
camp looks really good maybe right up

take the LPI certification test and we

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:26,090
always had that at Ohio Linux best but

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,370
LPI has put it out on their webpage that

00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,059

tests and and you don't have to miss a

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,500
talk that you really want wanted to see

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,150

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,950
choice to take the certification test so

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,169

good test taker so I asked but that

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:11,400

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,870
of the ways that were able to do that is

00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,909
one we have our sponsors they're the

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,000

the the enthusiasts level registration

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:31,620
is name your own price so if if you want

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,090
to chip in some money there that that

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,950
helps us out a lot

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:40,440
we also have what we call the supporter

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:43,110
package which is I forget the I forget

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:47,610
the cost now for that you know I'll pop

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,559
your head I think it's I started out 149

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,809
now it might be

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,120
99 something right there headquarter

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:56,210
package and that gives you a couple

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,190
little perks like gets you lunch on on

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,980
Friday and Saturday and get you a

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,529
t-shirt but basically it's it's a way

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,169
for people to to just kick us in some

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:09,409
extra money to help the conference keep

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:11,330
going so you know we get and then we

00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:16,039
also have people buying raffle tickets

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:19,480
so it's a it's a combination of those

00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:22,999
people who those attendees who kick in

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,549
some extra cash for us and also the

00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:28,210
sponsors and but we do you know it is

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:31,100
important to us that people are able to

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,769
attend for free if they if the you know

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,590
they're not able to to contribute any

00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:39,879
anything financially so we've always

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:43,629
wanted to make that make that available

00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:47,240
right we also want to thank our our

00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:51,320
speakers and our educators our

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:55,129
instructors that donate their time to to

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,450
provide the best they really they really

00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:59,860
put their heart and soul into they

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,999
provide the best quality and the

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,809
instructors are great that the speakers

00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:07,429
are - some of our speakers are actually

00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:10,460
former Keene odors that they just keep

00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:14,659
coming back and and and get better and

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,610
better so so we want to thank that and

00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:20,990
actually the whole staff is all

00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:24,740
volunteer I know a lot of us are not we

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,570
say we're a non-profit but nonprofits do

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,029
have salaries for their for their

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:33,009
charities but all of us are totally

00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:36,940
volunteer we we buy our own hotel rooms

00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:39,259
we pay for our own gas and and anyhow

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,409
it's a labor of love but it is

00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:44,210
definitely worth the effort yeah that's

00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:47,179
what I was going to mention about the

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:51,350
volunteer part everybody donating time

00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:56,029
and pulling off such an event it takes

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:59,629
like year-long preparation and countless

00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:02,419
meetings in hours volunteers are the

00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:07,100
people who make it happen

00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:09,470
and it is really something that you know

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:12,289
at least for me one of the attraction

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:16,090
and satisfaction that I feel like this

00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:21,289
is the only event where you can have

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:24,410
quality programs diversity of thought

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:28,030
diversity of speakers and you can still

00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:30,620
attend for free and this is the truth

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,660
spirit of the open source and free

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,360
software to have any conference that is

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,360
free to attend for people oh and it's

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,140
unbelievable that people pull it off

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,309
every year hey yeah I definitely agree

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,429
with that statement

00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:48,169
it's right right at the heart of open

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:51,230
source now freezing beer and fries and

00:31:48,169 --> 00:32:01,669
freedom and you guys really pulled that

00:31:51,230 --> 00:32:03,049
off too anyway so yeah I'm getting

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,809
excited about coming out there and

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:10,909
seeing you guys you guys have anything

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:12,470
else you want to talk about it or

00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:15,919
anybody who's still planning on coming

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:22,250
out here even though our block of rooms

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:25,850
was was sold out thankfully by going to

00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:30,070
our website with friend slash hotels you

00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:32,870
can try clicking on the Hyatt Hotel link

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,330
because there are some rooms that are

00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:39,350
less expensive than what it would be at

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:42,080
the Hyatt calm website and if somebody

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:44,780
should for whatever reason cancel a

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,580
reservation that was in our block there

00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,200
might be a room that still pops up by
