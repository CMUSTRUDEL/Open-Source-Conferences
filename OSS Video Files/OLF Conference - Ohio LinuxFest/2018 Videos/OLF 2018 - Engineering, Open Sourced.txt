Title: OLF 2018 - Engineering, Open Sourced
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Free and open source software has thrived in many domains, yet traditional engineering disciplines have proven a challenge and open source struggles to establish itself. This is slowly changing as traditional engineering software grows increasingly expensive and new engineering technologies are quickly adopted by the open source world. This presentation will explore the technical and social value for adopting open source technology in traditional engineering workflows, the immediate challenges to adoption, and the importance of engineering professionals‚Äô active participation in the development of free and open source engineering applications. Special attention will be given to the FreeCAD project, its uniqueness as an open source engineering tool, how it is rapidly evolving, and how it may become a powerful alternative for a domain dominated entirely by expensive proprietary software.

good afternoon my name is Joel Graf and

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,190
we're going to talk today about

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,740
engineering open source or the future of

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,480
engineering software and I realized I

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,860
didn't think about this going into it

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,080
but I'm an engineer and the more

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,030
traditional in the more traditional

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,430
professions the ones that existed prior

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,720
to the digital computer and I realized

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,160
that when engineering is thrown around

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,449
here especially at a Linux conference

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,070
that's typically not what people are

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,420
referring to so I'm talking about

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,830
engineering in the more traditional

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,199
sense and how open-source applies to

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,429
that or why it doesn't but before we get

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,250
into it I want to talk a little bit

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,710
about myself I am a I have a bachelor's

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,630
degree of civil engineering and I am a

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,670
licensed professional engineer in the

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,040
state of Illinois I'm a husband and

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,600
father two sons my wife Nicole my sons

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,000
Mike and Silas are here with us today

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,039
and this year I did something I've never

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,010
done before I founded a company I

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,629
started a company called think open LLC

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:55,800
and the reason I did that is because I

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,480
love open source I I love to advocate

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,940
for the use in the adoption of open

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,820
source and I've kind of realized that

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,920
the best way to do that is to advocate

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,140
for its use and adoption right where I

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,840
live and so I've begun looking for

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,909
opportunities to do that in the area

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,500
where I live which is more blue-collar

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,330
than anything there isn't a hole there

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,250
isn't really a tech culture to speak of

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,590
so you're kind of starting from scratch

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,420
in that sort of culture and I really

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,860
didn't expect to have much success but

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,540
strangely enough I've actually been

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,950
finding opportunities and one of them

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,770
I'm working with a local community

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,509
college where we're taking computers

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,939
that have been retired from the

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,380
community college lab labs and where

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,110
they would normally be sold on a sale

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,240
for 20 30 40 50 bucks a CPU we're

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,920
reserving those and we're gonna bring in

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,649
kids from the community who don't have

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,720
computers at home and we're gonna bring

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,670
them in and set these computers in front

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,009
of them and partly disassemble them and

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,560
let them assemble them so they learn how

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,000
a computer works have them install Linux

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,890
on them and set them up and for the

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,110
price of tuition when they're done they

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,850
get to take those computers home because

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,180
we didn't I never really realized this

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,409
but in our community we have a

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,909
significant number of families who don't

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,710
really have access to computers I've

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,940
never really appreciated that until I

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,099
started working with the people at the

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,740
Community College and and the whole

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,940
reason I'm mentioning this is because

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,340
I know I'm talking to a room full of

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,560
people that love open-source you

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,730
wouldn't be here if you didn't and if

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,410
you're the sort of person who likes to

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,330
advocate for it and really wants to see

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,710
it being used I want to encourage you to

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,150
look for opportunities where you live if

00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,770
you haven't already done so you might be

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,300
surprised at what you find I've come

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,290
across two in just the last year that I

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,720
just I simply wasn't expecting anyway

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,600
what we're talking about I forget about

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,430
this this is my contact information my

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,910
website doesn't have anything on it cuz

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,990
it just got things booted so there's

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,030
there's only nothing to see on the

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,880
website but my email Jolla think open

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,610
LLC Co is for real I do check that and

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,490
if you're interested in my LinkedIn down

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,770
below is is there as well so anyway

00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,850
we're talking today about open source

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,530
and engineering and one of the more

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,690
interesting engineering projects that's

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,450
out there is the free CAD project and

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,850
free cat is an open source 3d parametric

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,100
modeler now what makes three free CAD

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,490
unique is that there really is no other

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,250
open source project like free cat there

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,750
are other open-source CAD programs but

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,940
nothing that does parametric modeling

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,170
and when I say parametric I'm really

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,090
just opposing that with your more

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,190
traditional concept of 3d modeling that

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,780
you see you know when you see a Pixar

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,600
movie being made you know what you do

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,340
with 3d studio max or blender and in

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,260
those cases you create a 3d model that's

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,270
made up of a mesh of vertices connected

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,430
by edges that the create faces that you

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,440
then apply materials to to create a

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,570
signing beautiful pretty 3d model in

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,070
those cases if you want to adjust that

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,230
model you have to go in and push pull

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,350
and manipulate those vertices to change

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,480
the model with a parametric modeler is a

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,280
very simple almost trivial example let's

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,260
say I want to create a cylinder in 3d I

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,760
tell the I tell the modeler create a

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,760
cylinder it knows how to create a basic

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,650
cylinder then I say change the length of

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,300
that cylinder from 10 units to 15 and

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,040
it'll adjust the cylinder for me or

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,470
change the diameter from five units to

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,150
ten in other words I don't actually

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,370
manipulate the mesh I let the software

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,230
build the mesh for me and then I just

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,940
change a parameter that relates to a

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,120
dimension of that mesh and it will

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,350
automatically readjust another example

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,270
let's say I'm creating a mesh of a

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,180
bicycle tire and it has 50 spokes in it

00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:26,010
if I realize oh I wanted 40 spokes and

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
not 50 in that in blender I would have

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,610
to go in and rebuild

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,110
the spokes but in in some in a

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,660
parametric mother like freak ad as a

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,340
extreme simplification of course but in

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,630
a parametric model like freak ad I would

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,220
just have a parameter called number of

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,080
spokes and change it from 50 to 40 and

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,550
it would rebuild for me so that's the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,259
beauty of parametric modeling and it's

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,389
especially useful in engineering where

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,850
we speak in terms of parameters and

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,380
equations and things like that we don't

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,680
want to deal with meshes we're not

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,150
artists or engineers so free CAD is a

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,190
parametric modeler and its immediate

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,580
competition on would be mostly on the

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,680
commercial side with autodesk SolidWorks

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,570
or fusion 360 if you've heard of those

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,400
packages and I'm not saying that it

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,130
competes well with them in its current

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,620
state but that's its competition if we

00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,400
want to speak in those terms free CAD

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,039
was also born in Germany in 2000 2000 to

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,990
2004 the data escapes me well what's

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
good about it what's good about it is

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,320
that the three original developers that

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,270
began this project are still with it

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,520
today that's a really solid project it's

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,349
been around for a long time and it's and

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,910
it's starting to see a lot of rapid

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,930
development just in the last few years

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,820
so the free CAD the free CAD project is

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,800
based on the open cascade geometric

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,199
kernel this kernel is licensed under the

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,060
LGPL but it's also commercially

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,440
supported so it's stable it's not going

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,159
anywhere and that's where all of your

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,780
geometric operations take place it's

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,909
fully parametric from the ground up and

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,500
that's significant because there are

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,870
commercial packages out there that claim

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,870
to be parametric ed that are actually

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,130
built upon 2d or 3d CAD systems that are

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,360
not parametric by default so the

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,880
parametric tools are being pushed down

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,050
on top it doesn't work that well so it's

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,810
important to note the free CAD is

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,340
parametric from the ground up free CAD

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,320
is built on the concept of modular

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,150
workbenches this enables free CAD to be

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,490
used to model things that was never

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,320
intended by the original developers so

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,240
for example my history or my background

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,010
is in highway design so if I wanted to

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,180
use free CAD to do 3d Highway design

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,470
because believe it or not that's the

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,409
thing these days

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,479
I could sit down and I could build a

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:29,699
workbench that contain tools focused on

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:31,080
3d Highway design and as a matter of

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,130
fact I have over the last couple years

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,960
that I've been involved with the project

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,260
we have been working on something like

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,450
that this is very similar to the way

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,950
blender works both both applications or

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,420
C++ frameworks with PI

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,680
conscripting backends if you've used

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,390
blender if you're familiar with that you

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,830
know that a lot of the tools that you

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,780
run when you click on a button in the

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,550
blender interface actually runs a Python

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,290
script in the background and if you want

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,450
to you can change that script or write

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,240
your own script that then is driven

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,190
directly in the blender interface that's

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,440
the same idea that you get with free CAD

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,330
workbenches free CAD also supports a

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,310
wide variety of 3d data formats the

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,900
basic idea is that if you have 3d data

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,240
in a format that is supported by say a

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,280
Python library you can get it into free

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,960
CAD and once you get it into free CAD

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,300
you can do a lot of things with that you

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,880
can visualize it in 3d you can put

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,260
surfaces on it you can merge it with

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,580
other models you can export it to

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,190
different formats it's actually a very

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,460
powerful good feature for free kid free

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,140
CAD also supports CNC milling g-code CNC

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,110
milling is this process whereby you you

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,930
take as a stock raw material and you cut

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:37,410
shapes out to form more complex objects

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,760
and very often you're talking about

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,720
things like plasma cutters or laser

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,870
cutters that are cutting steel sheets or

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,130
wood sheets and in order to do that to

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,270
guide those cutters there's a thing

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,530
called g code and this is the

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,910
programming language if you will have

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,430
seen c mills so you can design your

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,770
shapes in freecad and it will generate

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,660
the g code which gives or provides the

00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,220
paths for the CNC mill cutter to follow

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,320
and then you just push that to the mill

00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,060
and it'll do its job free CAD also

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,160
supports 2d sheets support so if you

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,590
create a structure or a component in 3d

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,890
you could generate those those

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,420
two-dimensional plan engineering views

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,520
directly from your model in freecad

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,500
freecad also has initial support for 3d

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,170
rendering this is a recent thing there

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,580
is an internal renderer I think we're

00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:23,040
also working to integrate some external

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,620
renders it's it's still in development

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,240
it's not perfect but it is there and we

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,160
also have a thing called an integrated

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,440
spreadsheet this is kind of a neat tool

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,729
so what this means is that instead of

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,400
having to have a separate window with

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,229
LibreOffice calc or even Microsoft Excel

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,120
open you can have the integrated

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,430
spreadsheet open inside freecad and

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,680
what's nice about that is that you can

00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,330
link the cells in the spreadsheet to the

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,530
parameters in the model so as I'm

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,950
sitting there in the spreadsheet and

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,750
writing formulas to recalculate values

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,640
of the model parameters it will

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,660
automatically update the model itself so

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,860
the model will literally

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,250
sizes you change numbers in the

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,870
spreadsheet it's kind of fun to do the

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,329
current status the free cab project our

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,550
latest releases ODOT 17 don't be fooled

00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:08,459
if the version numbers I know it looks

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,750
very alpha but it's just a number and

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,060
cleanness Torvalds has said that a

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,629
number of times it's just a number we

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,939
released free CAD in February of 2018 Oh

00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,949
17 was released in February 2018 the

00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:22,139
development version the eighth of the Oh

00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,310
18 released candidate is well under

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,019
development we're actually approaching

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,300
feature freeze for that it will be

00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,370
released hopefully in February of 2019

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,879
we are trying to get on an annual

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,170
release cycle so that we can align our

00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,600
release as a free CAD with the Debian

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,509
repository so we can get the latest free

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,730
cat downstream to the aboon 2 community

00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:44,430
in Oh 18 we will be supporting Python 2

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,970
and python 3 side by side as Python 2

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,589
sunsets in 2020 then in AU 19 python 2

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,660
will be gone it'll be Python 3 that

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,850
represents a mountain of work just

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,500
getting Python going but we're actually

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,420
doing a very good job getting that taken

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,519
care of we're also transitioning from QT

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,310
4 to QT 5 for our user interface and

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,199
since Oh 17 has been released over 50

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,680
thousand lines of code has been added to

00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:09,720
the O 18 development release that's an

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,949
awful lot for a project the size of free

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,300
care that's really impressive and

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,519
there's already a lot of new features

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,509
and things that freecad 18 can do that

00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,560
that that wasn't present in 17 and the

00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:21,480
other thing is we have a new website

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,689
which I don't know I get excited about

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,339
stuff like that

00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,810
so what do people do with free cat well

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,430
there's a lot of stuff and if you go to

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,829
the free cat forums and you check out

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,399
the users showcase in the free cat

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,649
forums

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,329
you're gonna see just all the amazing

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,130
cool stuff that people do a free cat

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,930
it's I've spent hours just combing

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,730
through and you know just get my mind

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,389
blown by the stuff that's there this is

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,980
a good example the user here lemon bug

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:49,680
there into prosthetics for humans and

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,420
animals and one of their projects is to

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,819
create 3d printable prosthetics for dogs

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,920
and as I read the thread I learned a few

00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,050
things I learned that traditionally when

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,420
a dog has a leg amputated its removed to

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,800
the hip and more recently veterinarians

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,509
have become more sensitive to that issue

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,970
to the point where they can retain some

00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,380
of the leg they will because it's

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,639
possible to build a prosthetic so the

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,379
animal can regain some of the

00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,809
mobility once they've lost part of their

00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:16,679
leg and so with that in mind this user

00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:19,049
is now creating 3d prosthetics that a 3d

00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,610
model of an open-source 3d model of a

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,610
prosthetic that can be 3d printed then

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:28,889
this is another example of of a model I

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,679
hate to call this typical because it's

00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:34,470
not but it's you see stuff like this you

00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,730
see a lot of stuff like this and I this

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,929
is this is why I love going through the

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,749
users showcase because you get to see

00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,610
this really cool stuff that people do

00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:44,549
just it's mind-blowing this is a this is

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,199
an air-cooled radial engine from World

00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:48,119
War one biplane it was used in the likes

00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,939
of the Sopwith biplanes like the Sopwith

00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:52,799
Camel and the user that developed this

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:53,879
like I say there's an intricate amount

00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:58,160
of detail that you can see in that

00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:00,299
exploded view I just I love to look at

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,040
freak ads also good at structural

00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,049
analysis this is a little more my domain

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,549
I'm not a bridge engineer but I always

00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,439
thought structures was kind of cool so

00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:08,999
freak has really good at structural

00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:10,949
analysis and this is actually a finite

00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,779
element analysis of a pedestrian bridge

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,129
section I learned how to do finite

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,049
element analysis in college

00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:21,899
big ugly nasty hairy math matrix math

00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:24,779
yeah you know I'm talking about sorry

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,549
the thing is is I could do it but I

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,169
wouldn't ever care to and this is why we

00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:29,910
make software and this is a finite

00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:32,279
element analysis of a bridge section you

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,079
can see that a moment is being applied

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,790
to the end has got a clockwise twisting

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,540
moment going on you can see on the left

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,579
hand side the the outer edge of the deck

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,169
is being pushed up or bowed outward in

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,059
sort of a torsion it's being stretched

00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:48,239
or pulled it's under tension and that's

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,619
what the red red part of the heat map

00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,959
there indicates then on the other side

00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:53,879
you see the section is being compressed

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,919
downward pushed together so it's

00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,540
experiencing compression forces so

00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,549
finite element analysis is a very

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,619
effective accurate way of depicting the

00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:03,360
forces or the stresses and strains that

00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:05,369
are put on the structure or a component

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,399
as it's a plot as it's loaded by forces

00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:10,559
external to it and it creates it creates

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,360
this really nice very convenient visual

00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,290
heat map of where those stresses and

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,869
strains are and in what direction

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:20,249
they're acting it's actually a finite

00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:22,290
element analysis has been a part of

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,300
freakout I think since

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,100
version 12 I don't know for a long time

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,600
there's a lot of open source finite

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,750
element analysis tools that are out

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,730
there calculus Elmer are two that come

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,680
to the top of my head and that are

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,480
integrated into free CAD so that you can

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,070
run them directly from free CAD and

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,610
there's actually a significant list of

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,509
open source VM tools that are not yet

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,709
integrated but they're on a waiting list

00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:49,920
it's if you go through the wiki you'll

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:52,170
actually see that list another three in

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,110
free CAD does well is architecture York

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,670
van haver E is one of the original

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,980
developers for the free CAD project he's

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,529
professional architects he's an

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,440
architect by profession out of South

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:08,190
Paulo Brazil and he has spent an awful

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,319
lot of time developing tools for free

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:15,209
CAD to make it a very capable

00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:17,490
architectural tool so you if you take a

00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:20,579
look at his blog York tout uncreated net

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,670
you'll find he has a lot of a lot of

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,519
stuff to various pieces of software

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,839
there's a big section devoted free CAD

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,089
he's developed tools to focus on

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,050
building design using walls windows roof

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,819
elements so there's a good bit of

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,019
convenience in those features he's

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:42,209
created too deep just just like just

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,760
like structures and other components

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,500
there is a 2d plan visualization so that

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,000
when you create a building you can get

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,060
floor plans or cross sections of the

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,800
building quickly and easily

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,139
it'll the there's the ability to auto

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,790
generate Bills of materials so you could

00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,870
create a spreadsheet listing all of the

00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,100
materials that have gone into the

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,310
project and the quantities that are

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,199
required I orc has just recently worked

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,959
on integrating IFC support I have season

00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,790
if I'm right architecture isn't quite my

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,980
thing but if I'm right IFC is an open

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,899
data format that supports BIM Building

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,149
Information Management which is pretty

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,360
big in architecture these days so by

00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:21,269
adding IFC support any models in free

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,420
CAD that are created can be exported and

00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,160
made BIM compatible or BIM ready and

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,899
finally as I mentioned before early 3d

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,089
rendering support image that you see

00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,130
down on the lower half is not done in

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,569
free cat that was a result of exporting

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,490
the model to blender and rendering it

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,920
and blender cycles what you get in

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,480
freaked out

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,480
not gonna look that nice cycles is a

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,100
top-notch rendering engine but again we

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,459
do have some preliminary 3d rendering

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,660
support that does exist

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,829
one of the other projects that York has

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,899
been focused on is the wiki house

00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:52,029
project this is a project to create

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,740
housing of a modular design that can be

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:55,329
assembled with unskilled labor using

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,399
common materials available just about

00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,959
anywhere in the world the goal is to

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,570
create something that can be constructed

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,820
quickly simply and entirely with

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:08,110
open-source tools so a preliminary are a

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,940
demonstration of that project was done a

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,010
couple years ago I think now down in

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,060
Brazil you can see on the left there are

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,560
the structural members that are being

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,089
put together they fit together in jigsaw

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,529
fashion like you can put this together

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,449
with a small team of people in rubber

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,730
mallets it's that it's really that

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,350
simple and intended to be that simple

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,149
and then on the right hand side you see

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,800
the completed structure and you may look

00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,089
at that and think oh that's nice was I

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,250
don't know that I don't care to live in

00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,839
that and you have to understand that

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,180
that may not be serviceable housing

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,459
where we live and our cooler northern

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,019
climates but in Brazil that is perfectly

00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,910
serviceable housing given they're given

00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,560
their climates and their conditions but

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,480
other Wiki house projects have been done

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,890
I think in Europe and more northern

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,860
climates that are more representative

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,140
than of other conditions in other

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,529
climates

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,180
who else uses free CAD lulzbot if you

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:59,500
don't know lulzbot are the open source

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,000
3d printer people and lulz but several

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,680
years ago actually financially

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,199
contributed to the development of free

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,260
cats so they could use free CAD in their

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,179
internal design processes how much they

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,819
use it now I don't really know but what

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,400
I do know is being an open-source 3d

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,720
printer hardware company they publish

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,309
all of their plans for all of their

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,709
printers online and I went looking and

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,589
yes I can download the latest lulzbot

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,569
printer in free cads format so they must

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,919
use it to some extent but they have

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,990
financially supported us in the past

00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,910
we're big fans

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,890
another group open source ecology relies

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,600
heavily on free CAD if you haven't heard

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,910
of these guys they're very interesting

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,240
open source ecology was founded by a guy

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,410
by the name of Marcin Jakubowski he's a

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,900
doctorate from Poland

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,720
he's his organization is based here in

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,640
Missouri and his goal was to create a

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,330
global village Construction Set

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,490
what he

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,750
the building blocks of civilization this

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,960
was a kid of 50 open-source machines

00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,159
bulldozers tractors something called the

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,590
power cube which i think is a power

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,320
generator 3d printers all these

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,809
different things that in his mind was

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,850
necessary to create and sustain a

00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,679
civilization if we had to start from

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,480
scratch we needed machines what machines

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,149
would they be so they created the global

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,559
village Construction Set and they've

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:19,289
been working on it ever since I think

00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,039
for about ten years now they just

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,559
celebrated their ten-year anniversary

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,090
and right now one of their big things

00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:26,830
are 3d printer workshops so they go

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,299
around the country in the US and they

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,200
host these 3d printer workshops that

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:34,299
lasted several days and participants

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,279
come and they learn how to build a 3d

00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,809
printer from scratch and I think just a

00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,730
couple of weeks ago they did a one-day

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,620
build of a three foot by three foot 3d

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,899
printer is really amazing I saw their

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,370
post on Facebook board but they have

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,799
this concept of machines building

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,139
machines to create a sustainable open

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,690
source machine construction environment

00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:54,340
and they rely heavily on free CAD to

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,080
create these blueprints and designs and

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,760
they have some very good tutorials on

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,929
how to learn how to use free CAD so if

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,510
you want to check them out open source

00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,070
ecology org is their website I highly

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,750
recommend you follow them on Facebook

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,190
because that's where the real action

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,710
takes place that's where you see a lot

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,870
of the activity so we can see then that

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,549
there are a lot of there's a lot of

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,399
interesting uses that are developing and

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,200
free CAD is a stable powerful tool it's

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:20,049
functional in a production environment

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,970
but the question remains can an

00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:24,460
open-source engineering tool like free

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,380
CAD succeed in an engineering

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,940
environment that is typically dominated

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,559
by proprietary commercial software it's

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,690
a difficult question to answer sort of

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,690
like the year of the Linux desktop right

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,740
so can it succeed and that is it's a

00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,480
difficult question to answer but it

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,100
needs to succeed and there's some

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,980
serious reasons for that and one of the

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,230
guys that and one of the guys that

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,360
articulates those reasons well is a guy

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:56,289
by the name of dr. Rufus he's

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,330
the founder of the Open Knowledge

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,399
Foundation he's got a PhD in economics

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,899
from Cambridge University and he's a

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,010
fellow with the shuttleworth foundation

00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:06,550
Cambridge University and

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,080
a couple others dr. Pollux foundation

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,780
the open knowledge foundation was was

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,850
created to preserve knowledge in the

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,200
public interest to make sure knowledge

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,520
which benefits the public and which

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,410
should be made available to the public

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,930
is and isn't taking control by

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,720
proprietary or private interests and one

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:24,490
of the initial goals of his foundation

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,780
was to deal with pharmaceutical trials

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,190
the point being that when a

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,990
pharmaceutical company creates a new

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,690
drug they will Commission trials to

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,150
determine the efficacy of that drug now

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,250
if those trials are positive they'll

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,740
happily publish those results but if

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,510
they're negative well we might keep that

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,950
back because we have a shareholders

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,200
meeting next month you know you know how

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,300
that goes and of course if your life

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,500
happens to depend on that drug you're

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,150
gonna want to know the good and the bad

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,610
right so one of the goals of his

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,830
foundation was to and and they created

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,170
the open trials project I think is what

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,060
it's called but to get that data and

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,700
preserve it so that it is publicly

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,330
available regardless of the reflection

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,580
on the drug he's also the guy who came

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,460
up with the authoritative definition of

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,750
open data all right so if you if you

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,370
want to know what open data is you look

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,550
up the definition he's the guy that

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,500
wrote it more recently as organization

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:21,910
has been focusing on something that they

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:24,220
called the the global wealth divide and

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,630
it's a it's a division of wealth on a

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,840
scale that we've never seen before and

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,300
it's been created by none other than the

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,190
technology that we all know and love and

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,550
his point is that the ain't wealthiest

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,520
people in the world have among them over

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,700
half of the wealth of the poor half of

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,820
the world and he says this this division

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,550
of wealth where the elite are now at now

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,470
have an opportunity for the unmitigated

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,790
acquisition of wealth is growing on a

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,170
scale like we've never seen and the

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,720
reason for that is because we're driving

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:58,930
a digital economy with material

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,450
economics it's an interesting idea and

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,610
he goes on to describe what exactly that

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,170
means when we talk about material

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,430
economics and a digital economy says

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,590
there's three key effects that are

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,870
contributed to this global acquisition

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,690
of wealth among an elite few and that is

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,970
first the platform effect the second the

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,750
effect of costless copies the third the

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,560
effect of intellectual

00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,450
property now the first two are actually

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,490
intrinsic characteristics of a digital

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,920
economy these are things that just come

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:30,580
with a digital economy the third is to

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,200
holdover from the material economy so

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,120
when we talk about these when we talk

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,610
about the platform effect a good example

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,740
is Facebook versus MySpace how many here

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,930
had a myspace account when it was a

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,510
thing holy cow

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,210
I didn't care about social media till

00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:50,770
Facebook was was it it was the only real

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:52,870
option but at the time when MySpace and

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,320
Facebook coexisted in MySpace you know

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:57,730
was still a thing I really the two

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,050
services weren't that different they

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,820
offered a lot of the same features but

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,940
there were some minor differences

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,170
between them and the reason why myspace

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,690
failed is really kind of interesting

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,720
because if you ask the former CEO he'll

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,340
tell you that myspace failed because

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,960
when a user signed up for a myspace

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,450
account they were encouraged to use a

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,640
pseudonym whereas if you signed up with

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,070
a Facebook account you use your real

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,500
name now in retrospect that makes a lot

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,290
of sense right because if I'm gonna be

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,720
me I got to be me I can't have everybody

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,210
love me for who I am under a pseudonym

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,430
doesn't make sense but see in that day

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,990
myspace adopted the pseudonym approach

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,090
because well people were a little

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,100
reluctant about putting their faces and

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,260
names out there cuz you know I might

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,690
want to come along and abuse that of

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,160
course that's silly right we look on

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,780
that now and who'd I absolutely want to

00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,460
have use your personal data all the same

00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,500
though that risk of putting your real

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,060
name in real face out there it appealed

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,580
to the narcissists and all of us I guess

00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,260
you know and now Facebook is the

00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,460
dominant platform but note when we talk

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,320
about the platform in fact there's a

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,330
significant difference this isn't like

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,070
when I go to someone say could you give

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,450
me a Kleenex if I asked you for a

00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,610
Kleenex you'll know what I mean I need a

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,590
tissue right well why do I say Kleenex

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,630
because Kleenex is a dominant

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,860
manufacturer of tissue paper if I asked

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,620
for a Puffs you'll look at me and say

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,150
I'll catch you what I get you right but

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,560
the fact of the matter is is if I wanted

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,150
to go into business for myself making

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,370
tissue paper I could compete with

00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,350
Kleenex if I do my marketing right right

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,570
Kleenex dominates the market perhaps but

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,490
I could still compete not so in a

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,559
digital economy name for me

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:36,910
one successful alternative to Facebook

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:42,700
that can take users away from Facebook

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,900
I'll give you a hint it isn't Google+ if

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,730
you haven't already figured out there

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,870
aren't any because in a digital economy

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,390
with the platform effect

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,460
winner-takes-all there is no second

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:55,809
place there is no second place all right

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,040
that's and that's a characteristic of a

00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,170
digital economy and believe it or not

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,370
it's not necessarily a bad thing the

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,290
second characteristic is the

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,910
characteristic of costless copies so

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:05,770
when we say costless copies what we're

00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,450
saying is that when you have a digital

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,300
product in your hand you can reproduce

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,710
it quickly with a click of a button at

00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,230
little or no cost to yourself and

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,590
distribute it to your friends ok I could

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,880
do that with Windows 10 if I wanted to

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,559
as long as I wasn't saying selling

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,720
around sending around activating copies

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,650
alright I can't do that with a pair of

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,240
shoes all right the physical you know in

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,679
the material world physical products

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,630
have a physical presence that cost time

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
money energy resources to produce in the

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,890
digital world

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,840
these products are ephemeral there is no

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,059
cost to their production and

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,110
distribution more or less the cost of

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:46,480
electricity and this is this is another

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,190
powerful advantage of a digital economy

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,950
this makes freedom this this makes

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,570
information free for all ok this this

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,250
this is a very powerful effect that you

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:57,010
see in a digital economy that you can't

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,240
replicate in a material economy the

00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:05,530
third effect is the one that's causing

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:16,440
all the problems oh oh no oh no you know

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:16,440
what happened oh did it come up okay

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,730
okay

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:38,840
let's hope so the third effect is the

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,400
effect of intellectual property and with

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,630
the effect of intellectual property now

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,650
what you're doing is you're taking the

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,000
first two digital effects and you are

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,980
wrapping them up you're locking them up

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,270
in the hands of the intellectual

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,920
property holder because what happens

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:58,040
when you take a digital product and you

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:59,660
apply a and you apply a patent to it you

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,680
apply intellectual property to it what

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,110
you're saying is I will make this a

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,090
freely available to people under certain

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,380
terms and conditions price usually being

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,240
one of them and so what happens when

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,290
that when you do that is that certain

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,820
segments of the market that might

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,210
benefit from your product immediately

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,530
lose out for example you know they may

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,880
not be able to afford the technology

00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,070
they may be region-locked out the

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,510
technology or perhaps they want to use

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,610
the technology in a way that the license

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,840
won't allow or they can't innovate on

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,670
the technology if they can't get their

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,530
hands on it they can't improve it for

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,910
their own purposes all right these are

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,830
sort of the hallmarks of open source

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,430
that proprietary differentiates it from

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,570
proprietary software the second thing

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,340
that happens is the lack of transparency

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,630
like in the pharmaceutical industry they

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,430
want to protect that IP so they're not

00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,800
going to tell you everything and third

00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,570
is that the money if I go to Windows

00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,220
webs if I go to Microsoft's website at

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,750
download Windows 10 I install it on the

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,100
system Microsoft's going to charge me

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,690
over a hundred bucks for that activation

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,340
right and when you're selling hundreds

00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,620
of thousands or millions of copies of a

00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,970
piece of software at 100 bucks a pop how

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,410
long do you think it takes to recoup

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,560
your research and development costs for

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,330
that first copy of Windows 10 not long

00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,920
so where does the rest of that money go

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,870
it goes to the people who can make

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,800
Microsoft richer no offense to Microsoft

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,690
but that's where it goes they go to

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,040
marketing right go to marketing so

00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,630
Microsoft can expand into different

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,630
markets or turn around and sell that new

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,120
Windows 10 activation users activation a

00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,180
copy of I don't know Microsoft 365 or

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,370
something right so that's so the problem

00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,680
is is it's not saying that intellectual

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,420
property is wrong but as a holdover from

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,160
a material economy where it made a lot

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,320
of sense to do that in a digital economy

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,390
it's taking the strongest elements of a

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,940
digital economy and it's locking them up

00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,920
so it serves one and only one entity the

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,410
holder of intellectual property when it

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,380
should be serving the common good so

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,450
there's something

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,250
in the way intellectual in the way the

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,049
intellectual property is applied to a

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,820
digital economy and that is dr. Paul

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:52,559
it's chief argument we need to change

00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,450
the way that we go about making money

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,890
from digital products we can't continue

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,090
on the course we've been going on

00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,860
because it's intellectual property

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,490
that's creating this massive wealth

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,809
divide we're an elite few accumulate

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:09,419
more wealth than half the rest of the

00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:12,150
world using the keyboard all right so

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:13,860
when we take the digital characteristics

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,900
of a digital economy the platform effect

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,789
and the Costas copies and we apply to it

00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,880
the effective intellectual property

00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,799
we create this concept of lock-in and

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,159
this concept of lock-in is simply that

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,919
you've created a platform that is so

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,370
easily accessible so readily available

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,539
and meets your needs so well that if you

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,140
ever tried to leave you're gonna find

00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:40,140
that difficult if not impossible ok to

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,799
the point I invite all of you to go and

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,840
delete your Facebook accounts have you

00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,049
done it yes

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:53,330
I wish honestly I wish I could say I

00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,330
could but I I just I'm not there yet

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,340
fantastic consumer reports check it out

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,960
I know I will but the point of the

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,380
matter is it's one of those things where

00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,909
we all know we should give it up but we

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,169
can't and maybe some of us are ok with

00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,059
Facebook accounts if you're ok with a

00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:13,230
great but but the point of the matter is

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,390
Facebook gets a lot of flack in the

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,220
open-source community for for obvious

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,470
reasons and and it's a great example of

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,450
how lock-in works and this is something

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,120
that we suffer in all domains of

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,559
technology but especially we see this in

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,650
engineering in the more traditional

00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:32,250
forms of engineering so when we talk

00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,020
about this in engineering we need to

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,799
understand first what it requires in

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:43,860
order to be an engineer today and when

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:45,710
we talk about being an engineer ok what

00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,030
we talk about being an engineer today

00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,130
there's really two things that come into

00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,630
play first is that if I want to be an

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,400
engineer today I have to have competence

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,990
in a second I need to have tools my

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,820
competence comes to me in the form of

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,139
schooling where I go to school I

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,090
engineering knowledge and I learned how

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:02,639
to apply that to a real-world problem

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,259
then I go and I sit for a license to

00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,529
became a licensed professional engineer

00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:09,029
and by virtue of that licensure I signal

00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:13,350
to the world that not only am i capable

00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:16,169
of performing engineering buts but I

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,480
have the ethics and integrity to ensure

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,549
that I will not perform my engineering

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,840
in such a ways to benefit me and thereby

00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:23,940
risk the life health and safety of the

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,399
public that may depend upon my work

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,169
okay so licensure is as much about

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,539
ethics and integrity as it is about

00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:33,029
knowledge and so it's a very important

00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,559
element to Engineering the second half

00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,029
of that is tools and that is I may be a

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,250
competent engineer but I am not a

00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,450
capable engineer without my tools and so

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,490
my tools consist of the business

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,490
structures that we use to perform our

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,929
engineering activities and the software

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,179
that we use which is no small thing and

00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:52,980
now traditionally software has played us

00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:54,210
not that big of a role in terms of at

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,950
least the more traditional forms of

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,370
engineering give you an example as a

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,139
highway design engineer where I began 10

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,230
years before I began we started using

00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,879
CAD what did we do in CAD we did what we

00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,529
did for years and years by hand we drew

00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:09,299
we drew lines on the screen right we

00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:11,129
drew lines on a page was it better oh

00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:12,929
yes absolutely you were able to

00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:14,190
reproduce plans quickly in the end we

00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,320
were able to design better it wasn't a

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,730
wrong thing to do but it wasn't doing

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,409
anything different it was just a

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,470
different context same stuff different

00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,169
context by the time I started we were

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,580
doing using software to do geotechnical

00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:28,620
analysis structural analysis

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,690
hydrological analyses we were using

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,210
suffer to do increasingly complex tasks

00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,399
but in the end all this software did was

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,870
codify the physical rules that govern

00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,240
these problem domains that govern these

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,710
models all right so in the end the

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,210
software wasn't doing anything that we

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,080
as engineers could not have done for

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,519
ourselves by hand

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,830
what we went to school to learn how to

00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,539
do it could do it faster could do more

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,639
accurately happy to let it do the job

00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:53,279
but we could still do it in other words

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:54,600
we could check the math in the last five

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,980
years though that's starting to change

00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,440
something is happening in that's

00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,029
shifting this dichotomy especially in

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,879
the in the way software works and that

00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,230
is machine learning because when we talk

00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,639
about machine learning we're talking

00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,159
about an algorithm that doesn't care

00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,630
about the physical rules it only cares

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:16,419
about the patterns in the

00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:17,890
data so what happens when we you start

00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:20,620
using software like that is we now have

00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,520
software that's using the method that we

00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,620
can't validate as engineers and that has

00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:29,049
that has the ability to do a better job

00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,150
at our jobs than we do what do I mean by

00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,400
that well as a civil engineer I might be

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,470
called upon to design a mix of concrete

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,820
for a bridge or for a highway in a cold

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,740
weather climate and warm weather climate

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,340
depending on the various purposes and

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,320
conditions

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,789
I might just you know adjust the ratios

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,679
of water and sand and cement and

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:46,480
plasticizer whatever else goes into it

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,000
but I'll use the rules of material

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,940
science to solve that problem or I might

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,070
be I might be it might be necessary to

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,900
create a estimate for a highway

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,429
construction project so I need to know

00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,260
you know how much asphalt how much paint

00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:01,600
striping how much guardrail goes into it

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,789
and that I need to know well what what's

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,340
the cost index for labor or for steel

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,970
for fuel and then I'll use the rules or

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,109
laws of economics to solve that problem

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,240
but if I'm using a machine learning

00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:15,820
algorithm to do that I'm feeding it

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,369
concrete mix information I'm feeding it

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,540
construction cost information it's doing

00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:20,679
this thing and it's spitting out an

00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,109
answer and it's coming up with better

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,240
answers than I can come up with and it's

00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:26,889
a black box to me I don't know how it's

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,320
getting there I can't really check its

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,149
math and these aren't just hypothetical

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,790
situations because I've actually done

00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,440
this I have designed machine learning

00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,409
algorithms that can do these things

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,649
better or at least as well as I and

00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:44,020
other engineers can now is that a

00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:46,149
problem is that a problem that our tools

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,270
as engineers our tools are becoming more

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,669
competent than we are well some would

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,290
say it is others might argue but the

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:54,820
fact of the matter is is that's direct

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,560
the direction it's going whether we like

00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,630
it or not so if that's the direction

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,700
it's going I would argue it's a problem

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:04,000
under one condition only and that is

00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:08,380
that if we can't check the math that we

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,750
must own the tools what do I mean by

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,430
that well we live in a culture of vendor

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,600
lock-in especially in engineering when

00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,310
you hear somebody say I'm a Microsoft

00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,840
shop I'm an Amazon shop what does that

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,030
mean that means that what we need a

00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,670
solution we go to our favorite vendor to

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,530
the exclusion of all others vendor

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,400
lock-in because it's too expensive for

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,890
us to have to adopt

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,819
another vendor solution to make him talk

00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:32,020
because that's the way they want it

00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:34,089
right if that's the case as engineers

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,740
and now we rely on software that's

00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:37,569
smarter than we are so to speak in order

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:41,770
to solve any problems that we can no

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:43,390
longer solve by hand and we exclusively

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,680
license this software from a certain

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:48,309
vendor who then in the end is

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,079
responsible for my engineering me is it

00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:54,970
me or is it the software vendor as an

00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,200
engineer mentally I'm going to assign

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,569
that responsibility to that software

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,059
vendor but if that bridge falls in the

00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:03,400
water or that building falls down who's

00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:06,160
gonna take the blame me or the software

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,779
vendor that's right under the law and in

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,569
the eyes of the public I'm responsible

00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:12,010
so as a professional engineer if I am to

00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:14,380
bear the responsibility for my

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:18,640
engineering activities I must have

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:21,130
ownership of my tools I cannot allow a

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,630
company to have to take that

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,279
responsibility when their priority is

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,440
not my engineering problem

00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:28,930
but their bottom line and this isn't to

00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,599
demonize proprietary software or

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:34,029
demonize private interests this is just

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,920
a default conflict of interests that

00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:38,170
work that is going to be increasingly

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,760
problematic as we move forward into this

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,529
age where software gains an increasing

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,049
degree of competence we need to deal

00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:47,220
with that we need to have a way to take

00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:49,869
ownership of these tools and this is why

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,819
open-source matters because sound

00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:54,579
engineering should not require

00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:57,430
exclusively licensing someone else's

00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,170
intellectual property we should always

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,349
be able to get the job done without

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:06,970
having to pay someone else a specific

00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:08,619
amount of money to do it to help make

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,839
that point a little more clearly this is

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:14,470
the truesdell bridge over the Rock River

00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:16,990
in Dixon Illinois where I live this is

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,299
the day that it was opened for traffic I

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:23,230
think in 1869 you can actually see the

00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:24,490
founder of Dickson yeah there we go you

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,990
can actually see the founder of Dickson

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:29,079
and his wife Satan and their carriage in

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,520
the middle of the bridge right there the

00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,410
Trousdale bridge was designed by an

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,450
engineer by the name of Lucius Truesdale

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,700
who had actually built a bridge in Elgin

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,290
Illinois a few years before and during

00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,390
the construction of this

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:45,160
a couple sections of that bridge fell in

00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:47,170
the water now the report came back well

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,579
that was bolts have been loosened there

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,070
were substandard construction techniques

00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:54,010
whatever it was the result of that

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,180
analysis did not impact the construction

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,710
of this bridge it was also a single

00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,900
truss design whereas this was a double

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,640
so they felt confident in continuing the

00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,079
construction of this design and what

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,970
when it was done the people of Dixon

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,619
were understandably proud of it in 1869

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,140
if you had a bridge that look like that

00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,420
you'd be pretty proud to is a defining

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:14,440
feature of the city and so life went on

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,770
for some time until this happened May 4

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,570
18 73 there was a baptism taking place

00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,099
it was a Sunday and the number of people

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,599
were congregated on the north bank of

00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,460
the Rock River as you can see where the

00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:25,300
people are in that picture on the west

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,920
side of the bridge

00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,359
now in those days a baptism was a

00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,310
community event a lot of people turned

00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,440
out for and so a lot of people

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,490
congregated a lot along the bank and

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,800
then up on the bridge and the pedestrian

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:37,839
walkway and some boys climbed up and sat

00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,430
up on top of the trust you know look ma

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,339
no hands that sort of thing right that's

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,810
what kids do and as the story goes and

00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:47,310
you can read a very detailed account of

00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:49,690
it on Wikipedia but as the story goes

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,310
some time into the baptism you could

00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,540
hear this loud crack and bang and the

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,670
bridge were connected to the abutment

00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,200
the structure that was built into solid

00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,660
ground were transitioned back to dry

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,300
land the bridge cracked at the abutment

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,010
and the last section of the bridge fell

00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:06,790
completely into the water and it took

00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:09,190
with it a lot of people and by the time

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,349
it was done 46 people had died 56 were

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:14,680
injured and most of them were women and

00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,359
children now at the time that this

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,160
happened this was this was one of the

00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,369
largest bridge disasters in US history

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,950
at that point and a lot of people

00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:25,569
thought Lucius Truesdale had since died

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:28,119
it turns out three weeks later he shows

00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:30,069
up in Massachusetts and he writes to the

00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,150
Springfield Massachusetts newspaper a

00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,150
newspaper in Springfield Massachusetts

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:36,339
to defend himself and he says a lot of

00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,680
things in that one of the things he said

00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:42,010
and I'll never forget it was this he

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,589
said it is nearly 18 years since I began

00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,119
building iron bridges and the Elgin and

00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:47,890
Dixon bridges are the only ones that

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,450
have fallen and no loss of life except

00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:57,060
at Dixon and this much be said

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:59,190
any other plan he had three weeks he

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,260
breaks his silence to address this

00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:06,000
atrocity and he essentially shrugs his

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,980
shoulders and says stuff happens if you

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,870
disregard that even if you disregard the

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,480
callousness of this statement in light

00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,210
of what took place understand he refused

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,130
to take responsibility for the design

00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:21,690
which resulted in the injuries and

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:23,550
deaths of over a hundred people other

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,110
engineers of his they denounced his plan

00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,610
is unsafe and unfit and should never

00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,990
have been constructed Lucius Truesdale

00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,760
demonstrated that he lacks the

00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:33,870
competence in terms of both knowledge

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,430
and integrity to be an engineer and so

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,270
when I stand before you today and I say

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:41,190
I am a licensed professional engineer

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:44,670
understand that means something guys

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,800
like this are why licensure exists guys

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,320
like this are why the engineer bears

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,240
responsibility for his or her designs

00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,670
and we need to protect that

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,320
responsibility moving forward this is

00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:01,200
why we need open source in engineering

00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,520
so what is lock-in costing us today well

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,830
there are three key areas where we see

00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,480
locking first is proprietary formats and

00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,020
government specifications what am I

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,060
talking about

00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,240
well if a government agency wants a

00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,120
consulting firm to create a set of

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,030
engineering plans they will often say we

00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,460
need it submitted in dgn or DWG format

00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,780
what are these formats well if you know

00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,610
anything about CAD you know that they

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,440
are the proprietary data formats of the

00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,960
two leading CAD providers in the United

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,860
States and they are not compatible and

00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,620
that's by design

00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,780
again is that their fault no that's just

00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:37,050
a continuation of applying the

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,430
intellectual property the the effect of

00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,040
intellectual property from a material

00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,930
economy to a digital economy all right

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,920
you can't really blame the companies you

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,660
can't really blame the government

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,370
there's really nobody to blame it's just

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,080
that now we are facing the result of an

00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,910
inappropriate use of intellectual

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,260
property proprietary formats of

00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,760
government specifications it's a good

00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,630
example because what we are in effect

00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,660
saying is that engineering consultants

00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,890
if you want to bid on or get this public

00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,660
works project that is funded with

00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,980
taxpayer funds you must subsidize

00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,070
private vendor at

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,520
to the exclusion of all others with a

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,619
substantial sum of money that's an

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,170
ethical problem but again do we have a

00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,630
choice no because we live in a culture

00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,070
of vendor locking it's just the way that

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,950
this is where intellectual property has

00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,690
brought us licensing creates

00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:27,690
obsolescence that's another problem in

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:31,320
that when a proprietary vendor serves up

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,359
software they will or they have the

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,670
right to revoke that license at any time

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,960
or upgrade the software and refuse to

00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,910
support whatever version of software

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,310
you're running and if you're a small

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,080
agency having being forced to upgrade

00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,119
can be very expensive now is it

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,460
necessary that's debatable

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,930
you know it's understandable in the in

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,369
the in the business model and everything

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,880
it's understandable why it needs to be

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:56,400
done but is it always necessary probably

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,230
not and the third is it high cost

00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,550
restrict access to smaller agencies and

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,710
in that case I'm talking about county

00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,869
governments or small cities which may

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,570
need access to I don't know GIS

00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:08,670
applications right and those proprietary

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,830
commercial applications are expensive

00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,900
luckily for them there's an open-source

00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,390
option QGIS exists it's just as powerful

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,050
as this commercial alternative

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,320
unfortunately that's not the case for

00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:22,050
most engineering software so how do we

00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,609
solve this problem well to start we need

00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,290
to engineer the future with open source

00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:27,210
in mind which means governments must

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,440
take the lead I know everybody wants the

00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,790
government out of their business but we

00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
need governments to take the lead and

00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,560
the reason for this is because nothing

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,500
affects a nation's economy or policy

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,480
like its government that means

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,570
governments need to adopt an open-source

00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,210
first policy not one which excludes

00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,400
proprietary software but when searching

00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,380
for a technological solution considers

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,720
the open source solution before the

00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,160
proprietary and maybe even if an open

00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,750
source solution exists which doesn't

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,880
quite have the features that are needed

00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,530
they should consider investing in it to

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,750
get those features done rather than

00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:04,380
opting for a proprietary off-the-shelf

00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:07,200
solution second is the GPL protects

00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,640
transparency so when governments deal

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,670
with open source software and I know the

00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,130
GPL is a contentious topic in the open

00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,170
source world in free software world but

00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,540
the GPL protects transparency in

00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,740
government like nothing else can

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,050
nothing else can protect the

00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,960
transparency or the use of public funds

00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,640
to develop open source software like the

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,190
GPL and ensure that proprietary

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,920
interests cannot hijack it or make use

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:35,340
of it to their advantage without sharing

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,610
their code finally we need to subsidize

00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,350
open source and just by a just by making

00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,180
these policy changes governments can

00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,980
openly subsidize open source without

00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,890
even investing funds because when they

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,450
say we value open source any commercial

00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,040
technology vendors who want to do

00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,390
business with them are gonna have to

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,420
understand that they need to value open

00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,580
source too not only that but private

00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,830
organizations can openly subsidize open

00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,900
source as well for example let's say a

00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,370
number of engineering consultants got

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,900
together and pooled all the money that

00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,820
they spend on expensive commercial

00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,990
engineering software every year now

00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,330
let's say they use that to hire

00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:12,270
developers who I don't know develop some

00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:14,270
features in the free care project how

00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,560
much do you think we could get done if

00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,360
companies spent more time focusing on

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,930
and making open-source a priority rather

00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:24,030
than defaulting to their favorite vendor

00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,500
right by the way I'm not saying the free

00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,390
care guys actually want a ton of money

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,130
thrown at home they probably don't but

00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:32,850
you get the point you understand my own

00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:36,060
goal so with that are there any

00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:40,620
questions I don't know how much time we

00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:44,000
have left six minutes we got six minutes

00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,000
any questions yes sir

00:45:49,220 --> 00:46:00,990
open foam fo a.m. yes yes hmm actually

00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:03,390
it was a slide that I cut out of this

00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,100
just so I could make time free CAD does

00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:10,290
support computational fluid dynamics or

00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:11,340
CFD oh now you know what that's a

00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,510
question it's actually come up in the

00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,300
forum's recently under the guise of

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,880
certification no there is I mean there's

00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:20,810
people who have offered that sort of

00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,700
thing for specific purposes but not in a

00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,290
general context no but the question has

00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,390
come up recently how do we could we

00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:29,040
provide certification for free CAD that

00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,720
would be meaningful to institutions and

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,890
they're still kind of working through

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,369
that but we could certainly develop a

00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,089
series of

00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,559
tests to test competency tutorials and

00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:41,509
training classes that's that's a big

00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,509
thing that I can't really trust yes sir

00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:59,890
uh no and well yep right countries

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,880
across the world are recognizing

00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,260
governments across the world are

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,580
recognizing open source I'm sure a lot

00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,810
of us are aware of that they're

00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,700
recognizing the value of open source

00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,470
from a public perspective and you know

00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,940
the UK government has a huge open source

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,610
politics policy the federal government

00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,750
has a unit which develops in-house open

00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,910
source solutions for other federal

00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,410
government agencies it's really cool but

00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,450
you're not seeing that trickle down to

00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,710
you know state governments or local

00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,660
governments so much because nobody's

00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,860
really aware of it and in terms of CAD

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,110
and I can tell you again from the

00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:29,200
highway design perspective right now the

00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,670
CAD solutions for highway design are our

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,590
bleeding edge and there just isn't

00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:35,110
anything in the open source world free

00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,700
CAD is the start of that but there's

00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:40,150
really nothing in the open source world

00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,520
that can develop that which is why I'm

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,500
saying governments need to say we value

00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,910
open source before we value proprietary

00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,290
we need to start putting open source at

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,410
the front so we can develop those

00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:56,050
solutions and encourage that well but

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:57,940
otherwise I know there's I know I've

00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,500
seen individual cases of governments

00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:01,300
which have put open-source

00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,190
specifications in there but they're

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,660
world wide cases you know there's you

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,150
know like in Italy or France or

00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,340
something like that in in the US I'm not

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,840
really aware of anything specific I'm

00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,840
sure there's something yes

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:29,780
like I'm not sure I follow I know

00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:33,440
they've I know they've exported freecad

00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:37,150
to a web-based to WebGL and that sort of

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,150
thing there's been some tests on that

00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,180
offhand I'm not sure that's a good

00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,180
question yes sir

00:48:51,010 --> 00:49:00,590
murky waters there right that's murky

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,240
waters cuz when you see one and only one

00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,350
sponsor you start to think there's

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,150
something it's not good and then when

00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:09,050
you get a diversity then you have hard

00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:11,210
time reaching consensus that's you know

00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,590
you gotta understand or recognize the

00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:14,090
nature of the open-source project too

00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,410
because every projects different their

00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,660
goals are different some are bent on

00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,010
world domination others just want to

00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,080
make something that doesn't crash right

00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:22,250
you know it's it's it depends on the

00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,960
open source project and I'll give you an

00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,790
example for the free cat guys you know

00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,530
they're growing great guns they've got a

00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,630
cool community they've got a lot of

00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,980
support you just you go there with the

00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,540
problem and as long as you show that you

00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,490
put a little skin in the game they'll

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,330
they'll be with you to to help you

00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,980
through it

00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,840
but when it comes to things like money

00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,190
and that sort of stuff then you have to

00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,750
set up a foundation then you have to

00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,090
have administrative costs and that

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,340
becomes a real hassle and so having a

00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,590
single source to provide that sort of

00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,150
umbrella is always beneficial and that's

00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:54,530
I think that's kind of how these sorts

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:56,390
of things start to happen but it's

00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,700
something that I think probably a lot of

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,620
open-source communities are reluctant to

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,930
dip their toes in because they're afraid

00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,760
of commercial involvement and it's

00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,010
understandable because there's always

00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,210
that that tension in the open-source

00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,890
community we should be free of any

00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:12,170
commercial interests and others like no

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,320
this is this is how stuff gets supported

00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,430
is with money you know it's a hard

00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,290
question to answer and I think it's

00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:21,610
really dependent upon the project as to

00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:24,200
whether or not any commercial support is

00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:27,410
acceptable or whether you get a

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,760
diversity or a single source I don't

00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,350
really have an informed opinion though

00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:37,280
I'd like to hear yours at some point

00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:38,840
yes sir any institution using

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:45,470
open-source to teach engineers boy

00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:46,940
that's a good question yeah uh well

00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,410
that's just it as colleges are gonna

00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,120
educate engineers on the software that

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,470
they're gonna use in production that's

00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,270
why you got to go with governments who

00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,620
go after the consultants and then the

00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:56,630
college whistles follow suit otherwise

00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,520
your open source in colleges is

00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,410
relegated largely largely to academia

00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,600
and research projects that's my

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:09,020
experience of it uh you know you might

00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:10,910
see open source like I was just trying

00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,860
to think like open source text editors

00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,420
or development environments and you know

00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,420
software engineering they might use

00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,430
those but you're not gonna see I think

00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,870
without a lot of production a lot of

00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,070
adoption of open source in the

00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:26,080
production environment you're not going

00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:26,080
to see it on the education side

00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:50,599
there you go they offer their candy

00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:52,040
cheap right one of the advantages though

00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,450
in terms of Education when you're

00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,619
talking about getting open source into

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,420
education is when you're dealing with

00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,069
well-liked the community college that's

00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,079
near where I live they deal with a lot

00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:02,329
of they have a lot of students that you

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,750
know are don't have a lot of money right

00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:07,880
and so if we can teach them how to do 3d

00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,530
modeling and blender they can leave

00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,760
college and they still have access to

00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,710
blender they don't have to spend money

00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,510
on an expensive license and you can

00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,740
learn you know blender will teach you

00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,630
everything you need to know about 3d

00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:21,500
modeling you don't need 3d studio max to

00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:23,480
do it so that is that is a portal for or

00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,839
a way to get open source into education

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,839
I think

00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:50,980
that's how do you beat vendor locket I

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,010
wanted to say though from my experience

00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:56,620
people in government IT professionals in

00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:59,260
government liked the idea of open source

00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:00,700
they see the ethical responsibilities of

00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,430
it they they know that it makes sense

00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,680
and they would like to be able to adopt

00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,880
it so it's not like they're against open

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,950
source a lot of them are not against

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,760
open source on the idea of it or the

00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:16,900
value of it

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:23,950
they but their hands are tied but we

00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:25,750
don't have money yep what well it's with

00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,640
it from a government perspective you

00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,530
know in my and I'm talking from

00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,630
experiencing government is is that from

00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:32,950
a government expected perspective you're

00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:34,720
locked in to a solution and

00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:38,110
transitioning to another solution is

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,330
expensive now five minutes okay so

00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,740
transitioning to another solution is

00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,720
simply prohibitively expensive

00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,880
especially when you are responsible for

00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,320
taxpayer funds so if you spend millions

00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,980
millions of dollars to transition from

00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,360
Microsoft server to you know suzer or

00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,280
fedora or whatever for an enterprise

00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,110
solution you're accountable to that to

00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,550
who the general public now you may not

00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,350
be elected by them as an IT professional

00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,760
but you're still accountable for

00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,890
taxpayer money and the people who clear

00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,990
that money are elected by that so it's

00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,450
it's a bit of a you know there's a bit

00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:09,910
of a challenge in that and really you

00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,680
have to sell the idea of open source as

00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,540
the ethical thing to do because that's

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,340
what talks to governments that's what

00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,810
talks to lawyers lawyers are the ones

00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,610
that write policies and governments now

00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,230
the thing the other the other in

00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,940
the armor is the small government's the

00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:24,730
ones that cannot afford those expensive

00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:26,860
licenses okay you can talk to them and

00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:28,150
they will be able to hear that and see

00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,100
the value of open-source and they will

00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,360
not be constrained they will not be

00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,000
nearly as constrained as your larger

00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,470
government units might be but it's it's

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,010
a very big problem I hear it

00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:38,010
yes sir I'm back

00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:45,530
aha

00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,849
yep right to repair

00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,060
yeah

00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:36,220
right Repair is a very interesting topic

00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,660
and we are seeing a number of states in

00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,310
the u.s. that are adopting or

00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,260
considering adopting right to repair

00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,240
bills that work in favor of the farmer

00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,460
that require manufacturers to allow

00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,410
third parties to repair equipment like

00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,330
Apple tries to prevent people from doing

00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:51,040
to their iPhones and stuff right so

00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,480
that's a big thing and I think the right

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,390
to repair bills are going to be a major

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,240
part of this opening of proprietary

00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:00,370
hardware and software for open source or

00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:14,220
third party other third party solutions

00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:14,220
yes sir there we go in the back yes sir

00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,049
right

00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,190
not necessarily kind of in the same way

00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,470
that you use Linux but you don't really

00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,760
care about the kernel code like how many

00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:49,440
of us here actually go check out the

00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,100
kernel code I mean I have a couple of

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,410
times just because I can write but for

00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,390
the same idea is that we know that that

00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:59,910
software is open that the source code is

00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,380
visible all right and we can go in and

00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:03,150
we can check it but really when you're

00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,800
talking about machine learning it's not

00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:06,900
only just the algorithm but it's also

00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,670
the data because the data set that you

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,650
use to train the algorithm is almost as

00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:12,030
valuable as the algorithm a couple of

00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:14,040
reasons for that number one is the

00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:16,890
result that that's that's created the

00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,930
second is that data is very very time

00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,700
consuming and difficult to acquire for

00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,740
certain things you will spend more time

00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,970
acquiring data than you will developing

00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:27,420
the algorithm when it comes to machine

00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:29,340
learning nine times out of ten okay so I

00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,260
can see then then when you're talking

00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,370
about a machine learning algorithm that

00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,440
it's not just enough to have the

00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,760
algorithm but also the data set used to

00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,560
train the algorithm so that you can

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,730
validate that the data that was included

00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,930
in that data set is really

00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,270
representative of the problem you're

00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,520
trying to solve so those are the reasons

00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:47,210
why we need open data as well as open

00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,210
source yes

00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,700
yeah and that's the thing is even with

00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,040
these predictions these predictions are

00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,710
based on these predictions are solving

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,720
problems for which there are physical

00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:17,130
methods and means to solve so even if it

00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,450
makes predictions and I can't tell how

00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:20,609
it Mays prediction I can check it with

00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,750
my own math you know I can't check it's

00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:24,089
math but I can check it with my own

00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,410
validated but it's not hard to tell not

00:58:24,089 --> 00:58:27,089
hard to see that there could come a time

00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:28,710
when we are developing increasingly

00:58:27,089 --> 00:58:30,300
complex algorithms that can see patterns

00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:33,810
and data and start to solve problems

00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:36,990
that we do not have good physical models

00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:38,940
of good physical definition of the

00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,680
problem domain that we can't solve it

00:58:38,940 --> 00:59:28,400
either so alright with that I think I

00:58:40,680 --> 00:59:28,400
have to conclude this so thank you ok

00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:49,310
research innovation so ok ok thank you

00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,050
