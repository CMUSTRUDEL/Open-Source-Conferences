Title: OLF 2018 - Getting to Done Faster
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	I want to make life better for programmers and for businesses. Over the last few years I’ve been working in new ways that let me get my work done faster, with fewer bugs. I want to share some of those ways with you, to make your life better too. I’ll show you how to structure your work so that you deliver the right thing, faster, and with fewer bugs, by working in small increments and focusing on what is important.

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,810
so how many of you were in my earlier

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,150
talk okay

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,740
so you've never good portion of the room

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:15,660
fairly easy win there's only the one

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:19,320
track today so that talk I gave earlier

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,850
really came out of this talk fact as I

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,949
was giving this talk for the very first

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,539
time I like well like half of this stuff

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,670
is talking about team happiness so

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,859
you're gonna hear some overlap some of

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,510
the things that I talked about but

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,239
hopefully you hear lots of nice new

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,200
perspectives too it's something I want

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,940
to encourage you to do when you have

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,680
questions ask right then okay because

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,450
otherwise we go on you forget it and

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,910
chances are if you had a question about

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,070
something somebody else here did too and

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,140
don't forget these are being recorded so

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,300
somebody watching this on YouTube they

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,239
may have that same question so hopefully

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,780
your question can help them answer their

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,039
own questions and also please wait for

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,220
me to bring you the microphone so that

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,479
people on the recording can hear you so

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,470
who here likes to get their work done

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,240
faster all right good show of hands I

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,320
like that that's good you're in the

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,270
right talk then oh they talk on

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,729
extensive and excruciating planning will

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:26,009
be later in the afternoon and you know

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,579
as my subtitle for this slideshow so the

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,950
key to this really is work small of

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,420
course that's two words that's trying to

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:51,770
encompass a huge volume of huge volume

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:54,960
of thought and practice there we go okay

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,090
now I'm an agile consultant just as fair

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,500
warning we help companies do agile

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,560
transformations the core reason why I do

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,439
this why I love my job is that I want to

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,140
help my customers solve their problems

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,190
now the reason I'm an agile consultant

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:15,569
isn't I'm actually not very fussy about

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,670
how I solve that problem oh I don't I

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,160
don't approach something with a cookie

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,640
cutter approach of you know follow these

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,480
steps you'll get done fast anybody who's

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,190
looking for that out of this

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,599
presentation then sorry to disappoint

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,550
you and you may want to go ask for your

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,550
money back I'm not fussy about how I

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,769
solve the problem as long as my customer

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,769
is happy with what they've come up with

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:48,000
so as I as I warned earlier I am and ads

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:50,970
out consultant I've been drinking the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,440
kool-aid you know I get paid help people

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,120
make their companies more agile so

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
there's a bias there and keep that in

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,430
mind when you're hearing what I talk

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,900
about today so one of the things that I

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,450
want you to take away from this there is

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:16,530
no one true way to get your work done

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,769
faster there's a way that worked for me

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,379
when I worked with this client that way

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,989
is not gonna work for you you're gonna

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,879
have to find your own way hopefully I

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,590
can give you some hopefully today though

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,700
you're going to get some guideposts for

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,700
how to find that way

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,370
the very first thing one of the most

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,140
important things to keep in mind

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,569
whatever your problem is it's really a

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,030
people problem it's not your tech stack

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,190
although I've used text X I'm using a

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,629
tech stack that makes me think it could

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,790
factor high on my problem list the root

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:54,840
of the problem is really it's always

00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,849
about the people that you're working

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,630
with that you're trying to solve your

00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,320
problem with

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,770
and when you are trying to solve your

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,210
problem keep in mind that everything

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,550
you're going to do needs to be focused

00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,460
on the people that you're working with

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:14,880
and I'm not saying hire the right people

00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,800
but find practices that work with the

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,580
people that you have and the people that

00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,260
you can hire so we always want to get

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,410
the right people it's not always the

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:31,350
smartest people who here's taking an IQ

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,690
test as part of a job interview I would

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,120
put my hand up I've done it this used to

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,220
be a standard practice IBM pioneered it

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,510
in fact the IBM IQ test is kind of

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,260
iconic but here's the trick IQ isn't a

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,840
real thing

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,430
there is no good objective measure of an

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,040
intelligent elegance your intelligence

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,040
it's only relevant in the context in

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,560
which it's being measured you might come

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,820
across as incredibly stupid if I ask my

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,800
cat to do quantum physics my Kant

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,210
doesn't come out real bright now my

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,520
professors will tell you I didn't either

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:17,190
but I still do better than the cat if it

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,560
comes to catching a bird I don't come

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,890
out real bright my cat however is

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:28,110
spitting feathers his IQ test always

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:30,000
passes the thing the thing you really

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,850
want to look for is not the best the

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,320
brightest because that doesn't exist

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,530
what does exist is people who are

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,300
adaptable somebody who can get dropped

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,630
into a situation that's maybe unfamiliar

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,990
or the situation changes out from under

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,370
them those are really good people to

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,480
work with especially if you are trying

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,980
to be an agile organization now that's

00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,320
not to say that people who aren't

00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:01,020
adaptable don't have a place in your

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:04,650
company the more we'll talk about that

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,120
more a little bit later but you can be

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,150
very successful working with people who

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,620
aren't very adaptable as long as when

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,560
you're

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,840
you know who works on what you are

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,030
adaptable say well okay this person is

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,229
not adaptable but here's this process

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,889
that needs to be done and needs to be

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:24,350
done a lot and they're good at it if I

00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,910
give them this they will excel at it so

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,120
sometimes you have to be the one to be

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:37,310
adaptable because the people some of the

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:38,449
people you were working with can't be as

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,270
long as we're talking about people

00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:46,280
something really important take care of

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,710
them so your success is your success as

00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,229
a team it's going to depend on success

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:56,990
of all of the people on that team just

00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,440
like with a plant they need proper care

00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,440
of feeding

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,900
one of the one of the biggest things

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,300
that I always preach I've never found

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,730
there to be an exception to this is keep

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,990
a sustainable pace and how many people

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:19,120
here are familiar with the agile

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:21,430
manifesto okay maybe a third of the

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,590
people here all right it's an Angela

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,360
consultant obviously we post this up on

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,590
walls everywhere so I see it all the

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:35,320
time that speaker wants to catch up in

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,910
here pick up interference sustainable

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,070
pace is one of the core principles of

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,360
the agile manifesto that's not to say

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,610
sometimes we don't have to give some

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,650
extra effort but we don't try to sustain

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,400
that effort with tread sustain that

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,150
60-hour workweek the hey I don't go home

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,100
to my family until 10 o'clock at night

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,630
or I go home to my family I eat dinner

00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,600
and then I keep working till 10 o'clock

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,980
at night play that game once decided to

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,960
call it a night because there was a bug

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,670
that was dancing a Roomba across my

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,610
laptop stream and I was pretty sure at

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,930
that point then I wasn't gonna make the

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:18,100
best decisions that I was gonna make

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,840
that I could make so but it where I work

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,580
at pillar technology but just as a

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,680
personal thing I really do preach this

00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:30,970
no nights no weekends in no exceptions

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,099
I whenever we go whenever I go work with

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,210
a client who's been doing that and I

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,270
once worked with a client who's doing

00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,200
nights of weekends for a year straight

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,310
they were trying to save a million

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:46,600
dollars they did the nights they did the

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:50,530
weekends they farm stuff out to outside

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,790
consultants anything to get it done by

00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,590
the deadline to save 1 million dollars

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,810
they had a verifiable record they had

00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,630
verifiable records of $600,000 in sales

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,000
lost within the first six weeks of

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,480
triggering the system on the new system

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
on that doesn't cover all the hidden

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,450
costs

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
it doesn't cover you might have if you

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,530
saw my earlier talk talk about medical

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,529
expenses associated with burnout and

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:21,310
there were medical expenses associated

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,810
with those long hours it doesn't take

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,790
into account all those expenses -

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,259
doesn't take into account the lost sales

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,959
that they don't see because they didn't

00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:31,899
get far enough into the process to

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,759
register in the system so they didn't

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,860
save any money it cost them a lot of

00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,110
money they had to pay me to come in and

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,720
help fix it and I don't work cheap and I

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:44,069
don't work alone I work mostly with

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,069
people to build higher than I do

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,920
so that you know they say they had to

00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,930
spend an awful lot of money to get this

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,370
fixed the good news that clients in

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,009
really great shape now we don't work

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,689
with them anymore but I I see people

00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,279
that I worked with they're saying yeah

00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:58,689
you know there's those ideas that we

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,339
started with down in our little team

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:04,749
we're really pushing them out through

00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,089
the company the point being that so much

00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:07,990
the sales pitch for me but by doing

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,470
these things that I'm going to talk

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:16,809
about it can really catch on catch on

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:19,089
and spread so another thing that's

00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:22,329
really important to getting stuff done

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,029
is trust the teams I've worked on fast

00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:26,980
that I've enjoyed the most it's just

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,839
really high level of trust between the

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,399
business and the developers between

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,350
members of the development team and each

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,910
other remember is the business team in

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:38,500
each other and everybody talks about her

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,600
overseas you know when you're working

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,300
with people and say to patents you know

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,579
it's really hard well my best experience

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,389
ever was with a team that worked in the

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:54,600
UK we worked here we worked in Michigan

00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:57,009
they worked east of London that was

00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,110
single best business relationship I

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,550
think I've ever had between developers

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,389
in the business because we had this

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,759
incredibly high degree of trust you know

00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,550
if you trust if you trust each other you

00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,870
can get over all kinds of obstacles you

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:14,439
know even a five hour time zone

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,059
difference I will confess that I did I

00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,259
did wake up at four in the morning so

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:19,809
that we could do planning meetings in

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:23,610
there mornings some days I can't

00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,610
recommend that but it worked for us

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,230
so building trust isn't trivial it

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,820
doesn't come for free and I was very

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,640
fortunate in that situation that

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,000
somebody that I work with or worked with

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,260
he's no longer with my company he was

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,810
very good at building those kind of

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,000
relationships and he had set that up and

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,839
I got that luxury of walking into this

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,959
beautiful thing he's set up but I did

00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,450
get to watch how that was set up how

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:01,720
that was sustained so it's really three

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,000
simple little points be open about your

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,339
failings and weaknesses if you're not

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,339
good about something and that's gonna be

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,410
the show you know bring it up so hey you

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,000
know this is a new technology I don't

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,760
really know what that well we're gonna

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,810
have to explore a little bit what we're

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,100
doing it and the value of that is not to

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,130
you know not to make yourself look weak

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,890
or even to set low expectations it's to

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,870
let people know hey we're not gonna move

00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,420
at the pace that we're accustomed to

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,190
move in so we need to build that in to

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,440
our schedules we need to set that

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,860
expectation for ourselves we're not

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:44,459
going to be able to deliver quite as

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:47,459
fast so people know know what's coming

00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,990
you also want to encourage feedback

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,240
because even if you're open about your

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,070
failings and your weaknesses

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,079
you've got feelings of weakness that you

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,020
don't know about maybe you haven't had a

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,649
chance to discover them maybe you've got

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,250
a blind spot

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:07,149
we've all got giant blind spots - are we

00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:10,050
- what we can and can't do so encourage

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:14,880
feedback and you get that feedback

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:17,050
accept it as a gift and that's a hard

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,190
you know accept feedback as a gift it's

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,920
sort of a cliche and it's hard to

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:26,050
understand what that means just from

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,949
that but what it really means is when

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,630
somebody's giving you that feedback

00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:31,019
listen to them for the purpose of

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,730
understanding what they're saying

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,959
there's almost no need to respond this

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,140
practice probably better if you don't

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,829
respond thank them for the feedback

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,190
there might be things you didn't

00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:42,540
understand

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:47,010
about the feedback so it's worth asking

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,930
very open and honest questions about oh

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,580
you know you said yeah I said that

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,740
didn't go well there could you could you

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,420
clarify like what parts of that had

00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:03,940
trouble and then it's really important

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:05,260
act on that feedback you know oh maybe

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,910
the problem is I've got a mouth like a

00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,980
sailor and I'm working next to a

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,260
born-again Christian it is causing a

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,180
little friction real situation really

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,740
happened like most programmers I

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:24,190
profanity is the language I know best oh

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:28,840
I put a square box on my desk started

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:30,370
carrying coin like many married men I do

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,820
not carry cash because I'm not allowed

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:37,320
to keep it for long enough so I actually

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,320
had to start to have it of carrying coin

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,820
in my marriage ex when my wife was

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,680
almost always 12 carrying cash but

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,720
that's because early on I realized that

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,640
I had cash she's just gone I'm just

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,370
gonna hand it over to her anyway so I

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:57,640
start really early oh I've got cash

00:14:51,370 --> 00:15:00,310
let's give it to her Wow but act on that

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,890
feedback you know if if somebody tells

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,450
you hey you're being a jerk they're

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,560
probably gonna use stronger words but I

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,120
was told that this is a family-friendly

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,040
crowds we aren't gonna use the words

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,010
that they're probably going to use ask

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,860
for specific incidences now also try not

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,540
to be the jerk who gets defensive when

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,070
somebody tells you about your failings

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,860
don't get defensive

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:28,540
don't don't defend the position two

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:33,220
reasons one just rude they're trying to

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,690
help you - it makes you look weak if you

00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,060
were defending that means you were in

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,060
the subordinate position don't do that

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:50,060
the other the last item there is extend

00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:53,959
the trust that you want to receive to

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,810
other people without expecting anything

00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:02,720
back from them some of them are going to

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:04,310
disappoint you and I do talk about

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,319
accountability at some points in here

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,439
and that's where holding people

00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,670
accountable comes in but well some of

00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:13,279
them are probably going to disappoint

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,870
you many of them are not they're going

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,269
to instead reward your trust by doing

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,490
that thing that you asked when that

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:25,129
happens that bill that strengthens that

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,769
relationship that makes it so your team

00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,930
can work together faster so you have to

00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:32,980
spend less time negotiating things and

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,829
more time so hey can you do this and

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,569
it's gonna get done

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:40,610
again those feedback loops that I talked

00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:42,620
in there well feedback that's gonna come

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,300
that's gonna come into play there it's

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,329
probably the first time I ask some ask

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,220
for something for somebody if they don't

00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,839
ask me a lot of questions about what it

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,350
is that I really want they're not gonna

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,850
deliver what I was looking for and then

00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,209
I have to give that open and honest

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,370
feedback about hey I was really kind of

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,120
looking for this other thing and you

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,529
know that will help

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:12,429
that'll help establish that relationship

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:14,900
of trust know speaking of the feedback

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:18,860
this slide comes from a book called

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,510
getting naked by Patrick Lencioni would

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,280
you look this up on Amazon if you

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,579
haven't read the book I really encourage

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:30,830
you to to read it do not just put in the

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:34,780
title that will now and will also not be

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:39,260
a family-friendly search result I

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,450
experienced put in Patrick Lencioni he's

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,970
also the author of the five dysfunctions

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,429
of a team which is a really common

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,140
business book that people read in fact

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,299
if you're having problems with the trust

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,890
issue that's a good book to pick up

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,890
because that's something they talk about

00:17:54,260 --> 00:18:00,000
but one of his mantras is speak the kind

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,010
truth so I didn't get what I wanted out

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,610
of somebody say you know I wanted an

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,530
advertising campaign for our new product

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,990
or a new release is coming out and the

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,600
campaign they come up with is very much

00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:18,720
not what I want for the product I'm

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:20,940
working on I could either just suck it

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,180
up and deal with it which leads to a

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,470
resentment both I'm resenting them for

00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,380
not giving me what I want and they can

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:34,080
tell that I resent them and it's gonna

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:36,660
make bad feelings there instead when you

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,180
see the problem address it and address

00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,830
it right then it's just like working

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,330
with a dog when the dog does something

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,700
you don't want you gotta correct it

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:48,330
right then the dog doesn't know what

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:54,630
you're mad about people are not that

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:56,340
different than dogs confront the problem

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,560
right away people will ultimately be

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,270
happy that you talked to them right away

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,530
so they didn't continue doing something

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:06,780
that wasn't what was wanted but when

00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,260
you're when you're confronting them have

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,360
empathy for them because they what they

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,710
did they did in good faith they figured

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,000
this is what they're gonna want they're

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,910
gonna be very happy with what I'm doing

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,550
for them and so assume that they acted

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,320
in good faith and that from their

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,830
perspective they're there acting like a

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,650
rational person even if what you know

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:36,300
what they do for you is crazy from your

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:38,310
perspective and understand that there's

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,220
real people real feelings that get hurt

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,130
that's that's really important to

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,720
remember but if you do those people will

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,900
thank you for speaking speaking the

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,750
truth to them now I'm sure you've all

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,670
seen the meme on the internet too you

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,290
know everybody wants the truth until you

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,920
tell it to them and then you're a jerk

00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:02,880
again

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:04,950
we're family friendly oh she probably

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,190
these practices you don't have to be the

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,190
jerk

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,810
now another thing to keep in mind so

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,650
it's a person who let you down it's a

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:17,670
person

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:21,220
like I said it's always a people problem

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,900
but understand that the person really

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,260
isn't the problem there's something

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,230
about the situation that they're in

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:34,510
that is really what caused the root of

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:36,040
the problem so what you really want to

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,330
do when there is a problem is look for

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,180
the flaw in the system

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,010
maybe the flow you know that let's talk

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,080
about that egg campaign that somebody

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,750
did for me and I'm like I don't want to

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,190
be associated with that egg campaign you

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,380
know maybe the flaw is hey we don't have

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,710
a good feedback mechanism for taking

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:57,250
their bad ideas their ideas for

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,140
marketing and talking with the talking

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,380
with the rest of the team about what do

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,790
you really want out of this it's really

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,440
easy to just toss something over the

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,510
walls of the marketing department to say

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,850
hey do you promote this new release of

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,920
this product and then I don't have to

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,870
think about it again that's awesome I

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,250
don't have to think I like that thinking

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,740
the problem is of course I didn't make

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,260
the time to talk with them so they just

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,750
go off and do well this looks good

00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,020
this looks great they're really gonna

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,020
like it

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:36,520
see my point being addressed the

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,550
problems that are in the system as I

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,230
talked about remember they from their

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:45,450
perspective from whatever situation

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:49,240
they're in they're a rational actor so

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,980
you know Mike who checks in breaking

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,060
code changes and then leaves the country

00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:56,140
for six weeks this really happened at

00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,300
that place that working nights and

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,620
weekends gentleman checked in some

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:07,510
breaking changes broke everything and

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:08,920
then got on a plane for China and he was

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,750
going to visit family and they live in a

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,220
remote it's not like we could call him

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,680
up even if we were willing to bear the

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,190
international charges he wasn't where

00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,600
there was a phone he was not in a major

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,770
city if they live he was

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,070
going to see family that lived out in

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:29,770
the country sort of you know relax for a

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:31,270
little bit but from what he did from his

00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,080
perspective what he did was completely

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:38,220
rational people other teams had been

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,289
asking him hey can you do this thing and

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,490
so he did that thing what he hadn't

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:45,070
taken into account was that head

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,919
spillover effects on the rest of us and

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,660
broken it broke our stuff so from his

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,400
perspective he's a hero

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,740
I just enabled this whole team to do a

00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,299
great thing and now I'm gonna go take my

00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:00,940
well-earned vacation needless to say

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:06,190
that team was very happy and the other

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:09,850
teams were in that the fix the fix was a

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,220
fix to the system Mike very valuable

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,169
employee knows a lot of stuff he was

00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:19,030
able to make those big changes really

00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:20,380
quickly that helped a lot of people the

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,130
change in that case was to actually give

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,360
him a new role that was more suited to

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:33,880
his particular skill set which was

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:36,640
looking at how systems integrated so

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,220
another thing to keep in mind I want to

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,220
get done fast there's a lot of analogies

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:45,909
we like to tell people my favorite one

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,679
to go to as always

00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:50,380
analogies are powerful to give us a

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,299
model for thinking about a problem the

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,860
one they love to give us a school is

00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,169
building a house okay

00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,520
you're gonna make a plan it's gonna be

00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,630
great it's gonna be detailed you're

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,659
gonna know exactly where each outlet

00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,780
goes or each plumbing line goes you're

00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:06,280
gonna execute that plan they make us

00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,539
feel comfortable and safe I mean you

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,650
can't even actually build a house

00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:13,809
without submitting plans for approval if

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,669
you get caught building a house in there

00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:17,830
earn that plans filed with your Township

00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:25,600
you will be stopping building your house

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:27,070
you will be filing those plans these

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,840
plans make everybody feel comfortable so

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,770
we bring that into the software world or

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,179
the business world would make these

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,179
detailed plans and

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:43,000
who here has been in the military so

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,740
battle plans how well do those work how

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,040
often did you actually execute one to

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,040
completion

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:59,650
five minutes is pretty good record five

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,870
minutes is really good record oh you

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,850
know when we make a plan there's a

00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:08,380
reality there's things about reality we

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:10,240
don't know but yes you paraphrased it

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,230
perfectly there nope no plan survives

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,230
contact with the enemy

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,010
there's always reality that you don't

00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,890
know for one thing reality changes for

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,200
underneath you new regulatory things

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,000
come in not in the military realm so

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,470
much but you know in the business realm

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,480
the regulations get passed a new

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,830
competitor appears an existing

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,960
competitor comes up with a really cool

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,510
new product and you better respond or

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,690
your marker sure is gonna disappear you

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,210
know

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:45,070
the case of building a house hey they

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,390
find a rock a giant rock that can't be

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,250
moved where they were gonna put a

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,600
foundation foot it may be where they

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,980
were gonna put the nice bar in your

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,160
basement that you were really looking

00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:58,810
forward to instead there's this big rock

00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,310
that can't be shifted real houses don't

00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:05,050
even follow the house building analogy

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:07,030
that they teach us what we want instead

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,440
you got to have some plan you got to

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,380
know what you're gonna build which

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,610
instead of planning it in great detail

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:19,890
break your work down into short feedback

00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:23,170
loops so how many are in an agile shop

00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:28,960
okay a few of you so you have you have

00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:34,240
weekly or bi-weekly demos you demo every

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:41,530
day okay okay you have a demo over four

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:44,290
weeks okay so the point of the demo for

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,510
those who don't work in an agile shop

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,320
is this a developer I want to show the

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,280
work that I did to the business the

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,210
reason I do that is I want to note that

00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,640
I build the thing that they asked for

00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,010
and maybe even more importantly yeah

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,500
sure I built the thing they asked for is

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,780
that really the thing they wanted

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,510
because it happens a lot people think

00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,770
that there's a thing that they want and

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,540
then they get it and they realize oh

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,880
well that doesn't actually meet the need

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,070
that I have and it could be that the

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,230
need changed it could be that they

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,000
couldn't fully understand the need until

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:35,200
they saw an implementation of what they

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:38,850
asked for yes do that one-handed I used

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,290
to work in a waterfall shop and they

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,809
charted it out and if the customer

00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:47,410
wanted something done like a new button

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:49,540
it was 18 months six months to get out

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,850
of the company before they gave it to us

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,500
and then twelve months after that so it

00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,770
was a year and a half before they saw a

00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:02,290
change and it was wrong last year and

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:09,190
have lost that's an excellent point a

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:11,440
year and a half lost if your competitor

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,970
is bringing a new product to market you

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,919
you know about your new competitors

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,929
products hitting the market pretty much

00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:19,840
when they arrive at the market not much

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:23,400
before unless you're an industrial

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:28,410
espionage scheme is way better than most

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:31,090
a year and a half of letting your

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,970
competitor have that market that could

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:39,130
have been yours let's make a break for

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,840
most tech companies even even in a world

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,840
that's a little slower to respond like

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,679
automotive a year and a half man you're

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,679
looking for some trouble

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:58,550
so in addition to that lost opportunity

00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:00,340
that lost sales opportunity there these

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:05,750
short feedback loops are also good for

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:08,360
not building on mistakes so I build the

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,330
wrong thing yeah and then keep going for

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,070
a month two months nobody sees it then

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,550
suddenly somebody looks somebody looks

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,530
at it

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:22,960
hey that's that's not what we need I've

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:25,760
built everything on top of that mistake

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,040
so now I've got a ripple all of that out

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,380
that's an expensive change that's gonna

00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,830
be some long hard conversations about do

00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,420
I really need to change now of course

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,730
you kind of want to build the right

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,040
thing so that not changing has some

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,870
hidden costs itself I'm not building the

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:47,630
thing that I really need that my

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:49,850
customer really needs so I need and I

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,910
really need to respond quickly I need

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,800
any of those responses to be cheap they

00:29:52,910 --> 00:30:02,360
short feedback loops make it cheaper to

00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:05,210
change so we said we have a demo now

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,710
there's some tricks about your demo a

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,870
lot of people are really nervous about

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,870
not showing a prep polished product

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,460
you're probably further ahead dawn I

00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,890
always tell my customers this show the

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,460
incomplete work yeah the screen isn't

00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:25,100
much more than you know my experienced

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,620
architects scribbles on a piece of paper

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,030
that like they may have literally done

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:35,150
when they were taking the bus into work

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:36,410
that morning but still show that because

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:40,490
it gives people something that they can

00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:42,250
react to so you know if this it's like

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,300
the screen drying that you give somebody

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,360
if they look at say well that doesn't

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,560
capture what I need off of this this

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,140
doesn't have all the information on it

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,900
that we need to complete the task that

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,750
the screen is trying to solve you're

00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,820
gonna get that feedback quickly and hey

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,680
guess what it's only a sketch on paper

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,330
at that point nobody's built anything we

00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,210
haven't lost developer time on that

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,440
we're fixing it well it's still cheap or

00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,420
it's gone further and the developers

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,920
made the screen and maybe the full

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:16,030
functionality doesn't work behind it but

00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:17,740
it's got some of it if the stakeholders

00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,640
here the business the customer whoever

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,020
it is the people's buying you need if

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,820
they can look at that early and say well

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,420
that's not you know I know that's what I

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,060
asked for

00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,700
but what I really need it's actually

00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:33,070
this different thing you're able to

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:38,380
change direction while it's still cheap

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:40,150
while you're in the early games finally

00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,330
keep in mind who you're giving this

00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,520
feedback you're not your code so

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:47,890
somebody's somebody who rejected my this

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,780
screen that I you know I put the last 40

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:53,080
hours of my work life into this screen

00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,490
I'm pretty happy with what I did I think

00:31:53,080 --> 00:32:00,100
it's great I wouldn't even be showing it

00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:03,040
off when somebody says that's not what I

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:07,450
asked for that's not what I need

00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,330
don't take that personally that's its

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,620
feedback that might be hard to receive

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:16,720
but it's feedback you're gonna use to

00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:19,090
give them what they do need be willing

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,490
be willing to try out that work you did

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:26,860
to give somebody the thing that helps

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:28,780
them this happened to me recently by the

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,110
way we had spent we had not been doing

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,330
good feedback loops we spent several

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,390
months building plumbing layers there

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:42,970
was nothing we could show the plumbing

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:45,070
layers turned out to be wrong they made

00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,870
it harder to do the work and after

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,630
months of struggling with that harder to

00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:52,090
do the work I finally I talked about

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:54,130
don't do nights at weekends I took a

00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,350
couple of nights in a weekend and I

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:59,290
stripped it out in putting the thing

00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,800
that we needed stripped out all that

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:05,190
plumbing because it did make it was too

00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,190
painful

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,660
so this one this is a recent addition to

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,550
this slide deck and it comes from

00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,290
painting on the similar project about we

00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:21,650
hadn't had anything to show worked on

00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,300
palming layers really cool it's straight

00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:27,260
cold I can write test for it I don't

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:30,230
have easy testing situation I don't have

00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,640
those pesky users giving me feedback we

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,840
tried to push it out to production to

00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:39,560
show it off and that was it was a bad

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,060
time it was bad enough my HR director

00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,950
something walking around the office and

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,480
she pulled me as high as scissors you

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,990
look like you're having a really bad

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,820
time because we talked about this my H I

00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,190
just to give you some context my HR

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,690
director works remote that's how bad it

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:59,180
was she could see how bad a time I was

00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:01,280
having things I've seen on successful

00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,070
teams your very first week as a team

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,030
deploy to production I mean you don't

00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,520
really even know what you're gonna build

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:12,500
yet it doesn't matter get something

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,390
simple stand up and just stand up a core

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:19,160
empty app and whatever tech stack you're

00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:20,480
gonna use it in production just keep

00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,740
doing that keep pushing it all the way

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,910
up to production is offered if you

00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,930
possibly can in your environment what

00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,600
you're gonna find you're gonna find a

00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,830
lot of barriers to doing that if you're

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,690
at a large enterprise there's probably a

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,730
long list of approvals that an

00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:40,220
application has to go to before it can

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:41,750
reach production you're gonna spend have

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,900
to spend a lot of time removing those

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,910
barriers every barrier you run into try

00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,420
to try to knock it down or figure out a

00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:51,710
way to get over it quickly a lot of

00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,900
times that's gonna come down to trust

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,910
you know I mentioned before the

00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,200
importance of trust well you've got

00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,360
other teams you're gonna have to develop

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,440
trust with two you might need to develop

00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,780
some trust with the database

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,700
administrators so then brothers instead

00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,310
of a long lengthy review process to get

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,020
something approved you know they they

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,400
understand yeah this guy does know what

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,910
he's doing with the database he's not

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,040
going to do something idiotic and so

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,720
instead of having to go through you know

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,360
a multi-week review process for every

00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,980
single database change you can have it

00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,080
be so that he looks at it says yeah

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,910
that's good go ahead and we'll slot

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:32,770
into the next database update so you can

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,770
move faster to build that trust

00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,670
sometimes it's getting permissions to do

00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,400
stuff you know do you have even rights

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,450
to release something to production who

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
does have the rights to release

00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:47,170
something to production the barrier

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,170
might be just finding that person

00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:56,150
finally accept the fact you're gonna

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,490
build the wrong thing alright I am going

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:05,180
really slow only about 60% of the way

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:07,190
through this but except that you're

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,300
gonna build the wrong thing nobody

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,300
builds the right thing the first time

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,270
everybody likes to talk about the

00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,790
success of Tesla now there's a wonderful

00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,550
product they made you know Musk's first

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,740
electric car was a giant stinker on the

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,880
market

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,820
he used that to learn a lot of lessons

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,020
they came back with a better car you're

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,970
gonna do the same thing and hopefully

00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,900
it's not as expensive as standing up a

00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:36,470
whole car company you want to make

00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,730
changing directions cheap you really

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,130
want to invest the bare minimum and

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,470
planning plan enough so that you know

00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,030
what you're gonna build so that you can

00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,410
see some of the obstacles you're gonna

00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:51,430
hit but don't make this detailed plan

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,210
every feature we're possibly gonna need

00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,910
cuz you're not gonna you're not gonna

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,170
execute that plan I guarantee you the

00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,410
one thing you know about a plan is this

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,890
is what I'm not gonna do I'm not going

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:06,770
to do exactly what I planned

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:10,160
keep your backlog small now if you're a

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:12,110
product owner or a team lead one of the

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,660
ways that you often feel like I'm doing

00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,460
my job there's a long backlog of

00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,520
features and stories that we have to

00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:24,830
play to that's gonna get us where we

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:28,220
want to be but remember we aren't gonna

00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,270
do what we planned we hope to well we

00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,950
know we're not actually gonna execute

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,530
that exact plan we're gonna have to

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:37,330
change so if you've got this big backlog

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,330
of stuff that you're gonna do

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,710
gonna do it and so it's just noise it's

00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:50,119
time you've wasted craftsmanship the

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:54,540
quality of your work is really important

00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,680
and I say this not to be pretty pretty

00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:02,880
code princess which I have used on my

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,980
LinkedIn profile before is my title but

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,240
because if you pay attention to the

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,579
quality with what you're building your

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,740
software it's going to make it easier to

00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:12,599
change direction things are more modular

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,609
if they're more compartmentalized well

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,890
it's easy to rip out the part that needs

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:19,650
to change without breaking all of the

00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,710
other parts without having to touch

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,200
every file in the system unless what you

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,450
decided was oh we chose a bad tech stack

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:34,410
and we need a new language which happens

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:36,510
sometimes well I'm saying craftsmanship

00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,990
is important also don't prematurely

00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:42,480
optimize don't forget it's optimized for

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,880
performance until you know if you have a

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,079
performance problem in production if

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,319
productions fast enough

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,319
sure I could write more efficient code

00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:53,790
but is that a good use of my time first

00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,440
I'd be looking for a problem to solve

00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:00,839
for the business for for a user that

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,369
might be a better use of my time that

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,329
might make my annual profit sharing

00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:05,329
bonus a lot nicer

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,320
let me go back did you microphone see

00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,990
you know the drill

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:27,200
on that subject of premature after

00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:31,110
prematurely optimizing we have had for

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,600
some years now at work a huge push to

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,970
for the developers to optimize their

00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,110
store procedures and everything to

00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:43,590
really get the highest performance as of

00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:45,660
our critical business systems and in

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,670
virtually every case that we've scanned

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:51,480
through the procedures to find the pain

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:55,620
points ticket to steps that way it was

00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,960
because the it's good good ok it was

00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:12,150
because the databases were lacking

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:14,930
necessary indexes yep that actually

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:19,530
brings up a really to my co-host that

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:22,140
brings up a really great point oh don't

00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,610
try to optimize try to fix stuff without

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,890
having some good metrics about what's

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,750
really wrong because a lot of times what

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,910
you think is the problem isn't the

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,710
problem where we talked about the system

00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:35,270
you don't blame the system and not the

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,650
person before it's the same situation I

00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:40,980
think I feel in my gut this is the

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:42,750
problem this is where I see it but I

00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,760
need to actually analyze the system you

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,990
know get some real metrics and see is

00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,990
that the problem

00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:04,349
all right okay I'm so we are running a

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,730
little short on time we said I'm not

00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:08,480
gonna get between people at lunch I know

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,480
how to get trampled

00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:16,109
so yeah let's move some of these other

00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:18,740
things automation if you want to get

00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:21,450
done faster automate the stupid stuff

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,400
the things that take a lot of time don't

00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:26,550
add a lot of value if there's a way to

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,940
automate it do it my team just built

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:33,359
we're writing a essentially a live ETL

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,240
tool where we're converting from an

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,640
as/400 database great with db2 to

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,859
something that lives in the azure cloud

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,619
okay we aren't getting rid of the db2 we

00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:44,640
eat it they'll - we'll stay in sync it

00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,849
so there's a lot of time spent

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,339
translating db2 table names anybody's

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:52,980
use db2 knows there's some unwritten law

00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:57,240
somewhere that table names and field

00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:01,010
names cannot be readable by humans we're

00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:05,400
translating that to sequel server world

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,200
where there is strong encouragement to

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,880
make sure that somebody seeing your

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,230
schema can understand what you're

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,900
representing we used to spend a lot of

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,730
time looking in this mainframe data

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:22,760
dictionary which is literally a text

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,760
file you access on the as/400 Oh

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,960
used to spend a lot of time in there was

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:33,690
a subject matter expert and recently we

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,030
built an automated tool that could look

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,990
at that file for us and just describe

00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:42,119
this is what that data entity represents

00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:44,819
this is what makes one of these entities

00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,569
unique this is its linkage to other

00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:52,200
entities in the system

00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:57,500
we went from it takes most of a day to

00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:01,440
write one story card - we wrote I

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,700
believe we wrote ten story cards in the

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,519
space so one worked it

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,739
that saved us a lot of time that saved

00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,559
us having to take tie up the time of a

00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:16,519
subject-matter expert who has other

00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:16,519
demands on her time

00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:22,529
definitely automate your deployment your

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,019
CI we talked about CI CD systems if you

00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:27,150
are manually deploying anything please

00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,900
automate that if you don't know how to

00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:33,029
do that come talk to myself come talk to

00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,489
Jim who is presenting just before we do

00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:37,440
those things and I know lots of places

00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:40,670
that don't have automated deployment but

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,670
their deployment is very manual

00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,450
definitely automate that because that's

00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:49,109
a miserable time sucking chore

00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,729
there's good automation tools maybe in

00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:54,749
an ideal world you can automate backlog

00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:57,569
grooming as a tech leader I spend a lot

00:43:54,749 --> 00:44:01,049
of time with my backlog grooming if I

00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:02,400
could find a way to automate that when

00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:11,640
put myself out of a job and I could go

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:12,989
get a more fun job I'd say you'd have to

00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,660
add one more thing to that slide

00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:18,719
automate ruthlessly but not obsessively

00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:21,269
right don't yes don't try to always make

00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:25,219
it to that last mile sometimes 95

00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:25,219
percent is good enough right yes

00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:32,789
absolutely

00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,440
excellent caveat ever earlier we talked

00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:38,099
about optimization and don't do it

00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,890
pretty much early automation the form of

00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:47,130
optimization don't automate more than

00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:49,499
gonna give you value I'm really good at

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,839
hitting random buttons on this alright

00:44:49,499 --> 00:44:53,759
and also here's me I'm looking at the

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,809
mousepad upside the arrow pad upside

00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:58,680
down so I don't think I'm going

00:44:54,809 --> 00:45:01,170
backwards I'm going forwards industry

00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:04,319
best practices you know cancel your

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,329
subscription to CIO magazine for those

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,400
not familiar with CIO magazine they're

00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,739
probably along with the O'Reilly

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,229
organization the biggest propagator of

00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:14,279
buzzwords in our industry and all our

00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:16,469
applications suddenly have to get

00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,850
buzzword compliant so now we're all

00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:19,740
writing micro services

00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,630
except most of us aren't really ready

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,940
micro-services we're writing mano lists

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:30,360
just like we always were just have to be

00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:32,370
split across multiple processes just

00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,680
because something worked well for one

00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:38,040
company does not mean it's gonna work

00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:40,170
well at your company all right I said

00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,130
early on in this there is no one true

00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:46,620
way what works perfectly for for me is

00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:50,850
not going to work for you that's because

00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:52,640
we're all special snowflakes we

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:56,070
absolutely have to keep that in mind

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,950
that what I do is not what you do what

00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:05,280
you do is not what the next person does

00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:10,890
so oh I like snowflakes they're pretty

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:13,920
Oh something to really keep in mind

00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:16,500
consultants like me we love to sell

00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,500
systems if I could just prepackaged an

00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,140
anti transformation come drop it off of

00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,520
your desk I've got a script that I use

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:29,490
I'll tell you what I've been taking a

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:31,110
lot more vacations on Maui you know your

00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,510
if I come into your company you're

00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,860
paying me a lot of money to be there so

00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:36,720
there's this tendency to think well he's

00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,450
I'm paying a lot of money he must be

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:44,340
really smart but as smart as the average

00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:45,780
person how you know just because you're

00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,280
paying me a lot of money doesn't mean

00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,340
that the system I'm trying to sell you

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,600
was right just to be clear I won't try

00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:58,800
to sell you a system I will help you

00:46:51,600 --> 00:47:00,660
build a system this is these are like

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,050
plans you see this oh I could just

00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:08,970
follow these steps and I would be agile

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:11,420
no you won't you have to remember that

00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,420
it's different

00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,980
so it's important as this subject is to

00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,410
me I've already spoken for an hour on

00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:27,609
the subject of team health I don't

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:29,500
really want to belabor the point I've

00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:33,450
been able to smell lunch for the last 20

00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,450
minutes does anybody have questions

00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:47,349
let's look through these briefly so if

00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:57,010
it's about lunch I don't know the menu

00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:58,119
I'm sorry so the the short the short

00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,470
feedback loops that you were talking

00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,970
about earlier is there anything that you

00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:06,190
can do in the requirements gathering

00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:08,170
phase to bring what they ask for and

00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:20,349
what they need closer together

00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:22,450
absolutely so the very first thing is to

00:48:20,349 --> 00:48:25,359
build a feed left feedback loop into

00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,980
your requirements gathering phase I

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,390
talked about that team I worked with it

00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:32,710
was overseas and it was a really happy

00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:34,119
pairing relationship we had a feedback

00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:39,099
loop built into our requirements

00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:42,579
gathering phase where every time we

00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:44,230
every time a user story was written we

00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:46,510
were to review it with the team you know

00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,770
the business and the developers say does

00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,119
this have enough information that we

00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,119
really know what we're trying to do I

00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:57,549
found it to be actually pretty rare for

00:48:53,440 --> 00:49:00,099
companies to do that but in that case it

00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:02,740
it often highlighted hey we don't know a

00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:04,480
thing here we don't know a business goal

00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,280
here we don't know a regulatory

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,750
situation that we need to know more

00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,940
about and then you know the business

00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,650
which is based in the UK to go back and

00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,869
ask the people they needed to talk to

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,339
they're hey there's another requirement

00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:20,010
we think there's another requirement

00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:22,329
hiding out here we don't know about

00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:25,510
here's here's the questions that I got

00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:27,060
back from that it's not perfect but it

00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:30,240
definitely does

00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,580
we found that we had less stalling out

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,290
hey I can't complete this card because I

00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,870
don't know this thing I can't complete

00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:38,810
this user story did I answer your

00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:42,330
question

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:44,640
okay and if you if you come up with a

00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,050
better answer my contact information is

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:58,800
at the end of this presentation please

00:49:46,050 --> 00:50:01,470
send it to me the situation I have is

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,890
where we had the pranic owner we get

00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:07,320
with the quirements our we code test

00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:09,330
give it to him to look at and he sends

00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:13,980
us back a note yeah this all works and

00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:16,470
then a whole new list of extra stuff he

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,480
wants done in this sprint and then we

00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,190
talk to our manager okay we can do this

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,630
both put this is the next friend that

00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,670
manager looks know that I want you to

00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:26,430
try to get this stuff done in this

00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:29,070
sprint even though the whole time we

00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:31,860
developed code showed it to him now this

00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:43,290
extra stuff showed up but we gotta hurry

00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:45,150
up and give it in a couple days so what

00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:50,040
I heard out of that was a stick more of

00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:51,540
a sustainable pace issue and that's

00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,650
something that you might you know you

00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,980
might need to talk about accountability

00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:58,290
for that I have the Scoobies a hard

00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:01,710
conversation to have I understand oh I

00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:03,690
want this thing shoot I will often catch

00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:05,940
myself well it would be cooler if I did

00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:12,510
this too they will will solve this

00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:13,500
problem that we're having here but it

00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,000
seems like a place where you want to

00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,720
have one of those conversations about

00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,570
okay if I you know I've only got so much

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,210
time I can actually work so if I'm

00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:26,310
working on this something else is not

00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:28,110
gonna get done so which is more

00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:32,130
important which is more important for

00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:33,570
you to have I've been in a lot of

00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,870
situations where they will say well I

00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:38,940
want both and you know you're just gonna

00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,450
have to talk about speaking the kind

00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:42,400
truth

00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,079
you're gonna have to do that but yeah

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,440
you know I understand that wanting both

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,210
but here's how long this is probably

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,700
gonna take me but I'm working on that

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,240
I'm not working on this so what's it

00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,900
gonna be

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,369
What's in you don't have to go in fact I

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,829
wouldn't even just give a blanket

00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:01,630
statement if I'm sorry I can't do that

00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:03,940
let's say but maybe more approach that

00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:06,520
of which is what is more important to

00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:11,200
you but well what will make you happier

00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,670
to have give you joy this speech this

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,710
new thing that you just asked for or

00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,220
that other thing that you also asked for

00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:20,980
before you know if you if you can get

00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:23,650
somebody to that point you can really

00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,820
have a pretty happy outcome because you

00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:26,859
know we're supposed to be agile and

00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,900
we're supposed to adapt maybe it really

00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:30,970
is the important thing to do to say okay

00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,190
this new thing that we can see we kind

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:35,770
of need that now or it would help us a

00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:37,540
lot to have that now and that other

00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:44,020
thing isn't as important to have right

00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:48,819
now did that address your okay all right

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:50,380
other questions all right well then I'll

00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:52,829
not be the person standing between you

00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,829
and your lunch

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,040
