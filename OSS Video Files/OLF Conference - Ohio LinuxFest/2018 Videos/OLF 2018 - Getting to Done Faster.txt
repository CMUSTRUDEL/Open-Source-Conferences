Description: 
	I want to make life better for programmers and for businesses. Over the last few years I’ve been working in new ways that let me get my work done faster, with fewer bugs. I want to share some of those ways with you, to make your life better too. I’ll show you how to structure your work so that you deliver the right thing, faster, and with fewer bugs, by working in small increments and focusing on what is important.
