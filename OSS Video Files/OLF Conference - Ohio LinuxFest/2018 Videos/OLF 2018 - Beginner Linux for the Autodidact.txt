Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Presentation goal is to discuss methods for tackling the steep learning curve of the Linux world. It will outline a brief syllabus of learning goals for the beginner, and focus heavily on strategies to achieving these goals. The presentation will lean towards “”how to teach yourself,”” and not “”what you should teach yourself.”” Target audience is beginners interested in improving their Linux skills, and experienced Linux users looking to engage the beginner community.

okay hi everybody thank you for coming

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:08,630
to my talk my name is Brent a little bit

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,670
of background about myself I am I

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,920
studied music performance in college I

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,920
have a degree in classical music

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,119
performance which raises the question

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,240
what am I doing here but after doing

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,650
music performance for a little while I

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,010
moved abroad to teach English so I've

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,109
got a background in practicing music

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,669
really that's what music performance

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,430
degrees are like it's just practicing

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:39,809
and also a little bit of experience in

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,200
education so I'm gonna dissect the title

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,770
of my presentation for you

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:53,399
beginner linux for the autodidact

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:54,770
firstly nope here we go what is an

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,510
autodidact

00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:01,800
but I don't an autodidact is simply a

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,270
self-taught person but actually when I

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,450
think of the word autodidact the

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,700
connotation is kind of like a genius I

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,320
think of autodidact as geniuses this

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,299
might be an availability thing because

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
when you read about the word autodidact

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,890
and you read about these people you

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,380
necessarily get examples of famous

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,170
people who have made significant

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,180
contributions to their field so if

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,610
you're the kind of person that comes to

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,210
a Linux conference you probably don't

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,579
need introduction to Tesla but Tesla

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,979
didn't have formal education the Wright

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,860
brothers Michael Faraday these are all

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,380
examples of autodidact so for this

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,829
reason I don't really consider myself an

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,659
autodidact I'm definitely not on that

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,869
level I just I'm a person that likes to

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,140
learn things and also learning things

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,420
are a lot easier now for me because I've

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,969
got the Internet so it's much easier for

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,049
me than it was for these people

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,159
nextly as for the the word beginner I

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,750
don't think this presentation is

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,560
necessarily just for people who

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,190
installed Linux earlier this month

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,739
anybody who wants to improve and also

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,430
experience users looking to engage with

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,950
beginners

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,230
I do want to talk about kind of like a

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,840
gap in communication between people who

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,260
are so experienced and so good at this

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,640
that they don't really know how hard it

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,900
is for the people who are stepping into

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,609
this this realm for the first time and

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,010
also a lot of this stuff that I'm going

00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,629
to talk about today it's not really just

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:39,810
Linux specific I want to talk about how

00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,689
to accumulate skill a lot of the

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,310
information that I've found a lot of the

00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:49,049
research literature and this stuff is

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,849
not about Linux at all there's a lot of

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:52,919
research about how to accumulate skill

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,480
in sports because those outcomes are

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,030
very easy to measure there's a lot of

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,790
learning methods when it comes to

00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,799
studying music or languages as in

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,480
foreign languages so I've looked into

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,579
some research on all of these things

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,250
kind of cherry picked the ones that work

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,590
well that we can fit to Linux and we're

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,510
going to talk about these ideas and most

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,260
importantly in my opinion how to

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:19,879
practice Linux deliberately so with that

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,879
being said I've got to confess to you

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,979
the presentation title beginner Linux

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,930
for the autodidact it's not completely

00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,519
true it's just a really nice sounding

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,720
presentation that gets you come to this

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,989
conference hall it's not really just for

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,729
beginners it's not only about Linux I'm

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,209
not an autodidact so the honest

00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:44,609
presentation title today is how to teach

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:50,190
yourself stuff from a guy that's

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:54,109
questionably qualified so a quick

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,459
outline like what is Auto didacticism

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,590
why is it important how can we be more

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,970
effective as self-directed learners I

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,769
want to talk about tackling Linux and

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,970
specifically why this can be a really

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:11,519
unique challenge for beginners and the

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,000
major point here is the abstract before

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,030
the technical so basically understanding

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,299
what it is you're trying to do before

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:24,270
you learn how to do it and we'll go into

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:27,930
detail about that gathering learning

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,840
resources so a lot of the learning

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,669
I'm going to talk about our obvious like

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
reading books of course but I kind of

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,060
want to talk about putting it in a Linux

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,310
context vetting materials that work well

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,050
for you joining a community if you're at

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,780
Linux fest you're already doing a great

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,440
job at joining the community but I want

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,919
to talk about online communities as well

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,300
and finally what I said before what I

00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:00,810
think the most important thing is which

00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:06,710
would be how to practice so whose self

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:11,400
taught the oh yeah who is self taught

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:14,280
okay pretty much everybody here but

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,639
that's I was going to say the 2016 Stack

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Overflow survey said about 69% of people

00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,630
but a quick show of hands

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,030
it looks more than 69 percent in this

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,680
room at least so about 69 percent of

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,810
people that responded to the Stack

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,810
Overflow survey said they were

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,820
self-taught about 44 percent said they

00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,990
they received on-the-job training and I

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,590
think this reflects something really

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,740
important in computer science like the

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,169
tech world moves really quickly so we

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,389
have to learn quickly this is gonna help

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,120
make you flexible and competitive also

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,530
nobody knows everything so even if

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,930
you're already really experienced if you

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,080
know a lot about Linux or or whatever it

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,430
is that you're an expert in your field

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,810
being able to acquire knowledge quickly

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,979
is gonna help you always so there's

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,539
always going to be another tool out

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,330
there that if only you know how to use

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,199
it you'd be more effective at whatever

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,759
it is you're trying to do so when I was

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,050
designing this presentation I was

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,659
thinking of like what's a good thesis

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,199
how can I convince people that like this

00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:23,310
is an important topic and this was the

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,440
hardest slide for me to make because it

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,909
is a thesis it is a I do think it's a

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,539
good point and I will support it but

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:32,430
honestly like learning stuff is really

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,349
cool and it just seems self-evident and

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,469
I think everybody feels that way about

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:39,510
stuff so everybody's found themself like

00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,340
at two o'clock in the morning on a

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,780
really random Wikipedia article

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,130
oh my gosh I have to go to bed but I

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,090
can't stop reading we've all been there

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,520
but it doesn't make for a very good

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,389
thesis so actually in my heart my real

00:06:50,520 --> 00:07:04,199
point is learning stuff is cool

00:06:53,389 --> 00:07:11,400
Linux is cool let's learn Linux so on

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:13,229
the topic of how to learn I don't want

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,110
to be cliche but I'm going to I'm going

00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:21,930
to be incredibly cliche we have to learn

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:24,080
how to learn so this study from Nate

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,850
Cornell is a cognitive psychologist

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,070
called failing to predict future changes

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,280
in memory this is a really interesting

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,570
example about how if you don't really

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
know if you don't stop to think about

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:41,610
your learning techniques you could be

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:44,940
really really wrong Cornell says people

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,729
often have a faulty mental model of how

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,450
they learn and remember so this study in

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:53,250
2011 they took participants they gave

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,900
them some study material they asked them

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,020
what their judgment of learning was

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,460
which is basically asking how hard do

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,720
you think this will be to learn and then

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,310
they tested them on the material they

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,910
compared how hard did they say it would

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,970
be how hard was it actually and what the

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:13,410
what the results of the test showed was

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:15,270
that words presented in larger fonts

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:20,610
were incorrectly judged to be more

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:23,490
memorable now this is this is so

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,200
fascinating because no I don't think it

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,210
was the case that the participants got

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,900
the study materials and they were like

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:33,270
oh yeah these fonts huge this is going

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,500
to be a breeze this is the sort of thing

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,709
that you don't know that you're making

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,270
this weird strange human brain mistake

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:42,539
about the way that you're thinking and

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,850
these things happen all the time so what

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:50,400
are some study techniques that we know

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:53,070
work that we can apply to Linux recall

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,750
is better than rereading Nate Cornell

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,500
one of the psychologists and the last

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,600
studies was a part of this study as well

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,860
and recall is better than rereading this

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,750
is common in the language learning

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,980
community people like to use flashcards

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:12,720
to memorize stuff better more quickly

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,280
this is from an article called self

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,230
regulated learning beliefs techniques

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,610
and illusions so if you reread something

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,280
that gives the false impression of

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,720
understanding let's say you're working

00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,680
at your computer you try to remember the

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,590
command that you want to type into the

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,970
command line you open your book you skim

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,210
through you say oh yeah that's it I

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,270
remember that but it's not it's not

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,300
really recalling something it's more

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,640
like being reminded of it which is it's

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,520
just it's not the same thing being

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,160
reminded of the information and this is

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:50,100
one of the beautiful points making

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,600
errors is essential to the learning

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,370
process so this is actually a really

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,370
good thing if you're trying to remember

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,840
how to work through a command stop work

00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,640
it out of your memory for a second and

00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,100
even if you get it wrong and then

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,430
immediately correct yourself this is

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,230
going to enhance long term retention

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,190
this is going to be better for you to

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,190
learn more quickly

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:16,290
so Barbara Oakley is a professor of

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,240
engineering at Oakland University and

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,940
she's really big on the learning how to

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,580
learn scene and she's got a couple of

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,220
books on the subject I read a mine four

00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,610
numbers and one of the topics that she

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,900
talks about is guided reading guided

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,310
reading is more effective so the basic

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,730
point of guided reading is when you get

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:41,339
to a chapter in a textbook or something

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:45,480
don't read straight through it first go

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,460
through the headers read for new vocab

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,930
words that you don't recognize check out

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,070
the pictures get to the end and if

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,480
there's a summary at the end of the

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,760
chapter read through the summary and

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,580
then go through the chapter and what

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,170
this is going to do for you is it's

00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,030
going to help kind of create a mental

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,790
model that the topic that you're

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,860
learning right now you're not going to

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,820
be feeling around in the dark you're not

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,200
going to be asking yourself questions

00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,730
that are about to be answered on the

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,509
next page

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:16,810
and kind of my own personal philosophy

00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:18,160
on this is that a lot of textbooks that

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,509
you can learn from they really read like

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,040
a reference and that's not always very

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:25,870
useful and also it's really the author's

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,459
opinion of the best way to tackle this

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,639
material but that might not be the best

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,439
method for you so don't feel like you're

00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,879
signing a contract with the author that

00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,649
you have to go through this in the order

00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,449
that they wrote it really your goal is

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:39,189
to get the useful information out of it

00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,540
and if you need a skim back and forth

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:42,189
throughout the chapter and flip through

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:48,430
it and whatever method works best for

00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:53,220
you tackle it in a guided way then don't

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,850
waste your time going page for page so

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,529
some of these things are about

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,029
memorizing but this is a really

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,480
important point understanding and

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:03,759
memorizing of course these are two

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,899
different things they work well together

00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:13,350
and our goal here is to understand Linux

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:16,149
now I will assert that using

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,870
memorization techniques can help assist

00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:23,490
that and I think if you use memorization

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:27,250
techniques effectively you can learn

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:30,370
pretty quickly but our goal now our

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,829
method will be to take the information

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,689
hold it in memory until that we until we

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:38,519
can create a good understanding of it

00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:41,439
and then and then it's effortless so

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,910
this comes from effective learning 20

00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:48,309
rules of formulating knowledge this is

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:51,129
from Kyoto or Wozniak a memory

00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:55,120
researcher he says do not learn if you

00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:57,790
do not understand and that kind of

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,319
sounds like a bad translation like how

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,490
do we make meaning out of that but it's

00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,439
it's a really good point

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,959
if the resource you're learning from

00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:06,819
says this is how you partition a hard

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,089
drive and you don't know what a

00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,910
partition is you have to stop don't

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,199
learn how to partition the hard drive

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,670
start asking questions like what is a

00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:20,460
partition why do I need this but if you

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,260
waste your time memorizing

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,180
the command for partitioning a hard

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,870
drive it's going to be useless to you if

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:35,040
you don't know how or when or why you

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:37,560
ought to be using it this is a really

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,520
interesting point learners don't

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,300
understand

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:46,380
episodic versus semantic memory and when

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:51,620
I read this I was like yes that is so

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:57,660
true I have no idea what that means but

00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:00,570
I researched it and it's a very useful

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,100
way of dividing the things that you're

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,920
thinking about basically don't memorize

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,570
a bunch of trivia instead you have to

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,800
relate things to personal experiences or

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,280
information that you're already really

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:21,990
familiar with so this is from endl

00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:24,150
tolven a cognitive psychologist in the

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:26,990
article episodic and semantic memory he

00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,630
talks about episodic memory an episodic

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,510
memory his example is meeting a retired

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,750
sea captain an example of a semantic

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:42,990
memory would be the chemical formula for

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:49,110
salt so to me one of these is much more

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:51,750
interesting and one of them is much more

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:57,060
memorable so I have a personal anecdote

00:14:51,750 --> 00:15:02,280
with episodic memories when I first

00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,540
started learning Linux I was flipping

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,530
through textbooks and reading stuff

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,780
online and one of the topics that kept

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,520
coming up was cron then cron works a

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,710
little bit differently from regular

00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,480
commands it's not the normal syntax that

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:20,310
I had been seen and it kept coming up

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,650
like cron or cron job cron tab and you

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,010
use it to make a daemon or a daemon and

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,140
it was this sort of mystic thing to me I

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,700
wasn't sure what it was but man it

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,220
sounded so cool and it sounded so

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,010
powerful and I was thinking if only I

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,920
could master

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,330
cron then I'd been I'd really have it

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,750
then I wouldn't be a beginner anymore

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,150
I'd be I'd really be a Linux guy if I

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,430
just if I knew what this meant but I was

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,090
intimidated by it and I couldn't figure

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,040
it out and at about the same time I was

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,060
reading the book Snow Crash by Neal

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,210
Stephenson so Snow Crash if you haven't

00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,910
read it it's it's a cyberpunk sci-fi it

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:07,320
was written in the early 1990s and it's

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:09,400
just the perfect mix of early 1990s

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,440
cyberpunk it's set in this sort of

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,680
Metaverse like a virtual reality like

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,700
the matrix or ready player ones the

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:22,420
ocean and it's you know the main

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,640
character our hero his name is Hiro he's

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,610
got two samurai swords on his back and

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,830
he goes around fighting organized crime

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:33,190
so there was this scene in Snow Crash

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:37,330
set inside the meta verse which is this

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:40,900
virtual reality place inside the Black

00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,090
Sun which is this seedy Tokyo esque bar

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,540
filled with organized crime and

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:49,450
gangsters so I'll read this passage from

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,130
the chapter where they talk about the

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:56,770
demons of this virtual reality so a

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,740
daemon is an old piece of jargon from

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:01,780
the UNIX operating system where it

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,600
referred to a piece of low-level utility

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,810
software a fundamental part of the

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,570
operating system in the Black Sun a

00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:14,199
daemon is like an avatar but it does not

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:16,510
represent a human being it's a robust

00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,270
it's a robot that lives in the Metaverse

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:22,480
a piece of software a kind of spirit

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,870
that inhabits the machine usually with

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,760
some particular role to carry out the

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,490
Black Sun has a number of demons that

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,440
serve imaginary drinks to the patrons

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,440
and run little errands for people

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,000
this is a really good example of an

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,680
episodic memory this was incredibly

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,590
memorable to me and when I read this I

00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,990
wasn't I wasn't reading this for any

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,080
Linux related purpose it's just a nerdy

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,230
sci-fi book but when I read it it

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,240
clicked I was like ah

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,070
Damon's there cron is just a little

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,150
robot I looked at my computer and I was

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,190
like there are little robots walking

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,780
around in there serving drinks are doing

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,350
whatever I tell them to do just kind of

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:13,120
monitoring the things and the demons are

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,200
a reoccurring character that come up and

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:21,400
help keep the you know the Black Sun the

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,080
bar clean and kick-out unworthy patrons

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,490
and stuff like that and and kind of

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,070
making this into a character into this

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:31,120
sort of memory this memorable experience

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:36,910
everything made sense to me now it

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,260
clicked so our goal how do we take these

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,310
learning techniques that we were talking

00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,500
about and make episodic memories out of

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,390
them and this is this is really common

00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,520
with memory champions there's a really

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:53,830
interesting book called moonwalking with

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:56,860
Einstein by Joshua 4 and he started

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,450
doing investigative journalism into the

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,070
United States memory champions and

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,040
somebody there inspired and they said

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:06,670
you could do it too the very next year

00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,930
he won the memory championship he writes

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,790
about the techniques and it's really

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,980
interesting they take abstract kind of

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,060
almost absurd imagery and they tie it to

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,990
the thing that they're trying to learn

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,970
you make a mnemonic out of it and then

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,530
it's so memorable that you're not you're

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,730
not going to forget it and it creates

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,370
something that's abstract and turns it

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,230
into a personal experience so our goal

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,900
now we're not going to get as crazy as

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,960
writing a sci-fi book for it but we want

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,440
to create memorable experiences using

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,440
Linux

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,790
okay so

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,809
what makes Linux so difficult I think

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,400
one of the first things that makes Linux

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,230
really difficult for beginners is the

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,080
jargon jargon means like a technical

00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,820
word unique to a subject and anybody who

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,260
steps their foot into the Linux tour for

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,030
the first time is gonna be bombarded

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,659
with words that they've never heard

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,220
before

00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:24,049
now for me I I'm not a big fan of the

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,840
word jargon because I think of like in

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:29,600
TV shows when there's that one character

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,610
that's always asking questions like they

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,230
don't understand anything and they ask

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,820
really obvious questions so that

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,220
somebody can explain it in a dumbed down

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,200
way so the general audience watching at

00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,970
home can understand and they always say

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,640
things like wait a minute say that in

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,610
English please this is the character I

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,380
think of when I hear the word jargon so

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,070
I have I have a better word for it a

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,140
word that I like more

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,700
Arkana

00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:00,169
specialized knowledge that is mysterious

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,210
to the uninitiated and if you're

00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,740
uninitiated on this particular subject I

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,190
totally stole that from Dungeons and

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:11,360
Dragons

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:12,830
so Linux is filled with Arcana when I

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,240
told my family and friends that I'd be

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,590
speaking in a Linux conference they were

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,520
really excited for me they're like

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:23,299
that's great that's so cool what's Linux

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:27,679
and I was like okay well it's an

00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:30,710
operating system like yeah like well

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,720
it's it's technically it's a kernel but

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,520
it's a it's an optic it's canoe and

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,049
Linux makes the operating system and

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,850
it's good for servers but I use it for

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:41,570
programming and they're like whoa whoa

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:46,900
whoa say that in English please think

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:52,090
okay so how can we demystify the Arcana

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:58,940
so one of the hard things about Linux is

00:21:52,090 --> 00:22:01,190
once you start you know the

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,260
learning curve feels like a vertical

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:07,190
wall it just feels like it's straight up

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,570
so you get into the terminal you start

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,130
typing some commands the first ten

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,830
commands you learn are always basic

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,480
navigation it's really boring you're

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,430
moving from one directory to the next

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,660
you make some files make some

00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,610
directories delete them and you're like

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,830
wow this is way easier in Windows why am

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,630
I doing this this list is so boring

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,890
I don't even finish the list I just

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,860
started to make it I was like they get

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,130
the point I'm not gonna it's not that

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,130
exciting

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,300
Arkana makes it really difficult to

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:37,220
understand so anything on this list

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,620
right here I'll use shell bash and

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:43,790
terminal for example when you're

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:48,710
learning Linux these words seem to pop

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:50,000
up interchangeably and people insist

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,130
that there's an important difference

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,480
between a shell a bash in the terminal

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,640
but I can't figure out what it is and

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,380
pretty much anything on this list it's

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,200
got a counterpart should I use touch or

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,690
cat to start to open a file and these

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,800
things there are nuance differences but

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm not even sure what questions I

00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,060
should be asking to get to whatever the

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,860
nuance difference is is it am I going to

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,850
break something if I use touch instead

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,500
of cat to create a file so commands that

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,200
you don't understand they seem arbitrary

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:22,010
so if you go to ask you bun to calm and

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,380
sort by the most voted question highest

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,620
question on the list is how to list all

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,300
installed packages and full disclaimer I

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,160
cherry-pick the really complicated

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:38,720
looking ones it's not that hard you can

00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:40,760
just type apt apt list installed but all

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,090
of these commands allegedly they'll get

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:48,350
you the same thing and if you're a

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,880
beginner all of that seems like nonsense

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,440
it seems like you could type just about

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,330
anything in there and you get a

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,730
different output

00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:58,030
there's no way to decode this for the

00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,030
uninitiated

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,370
so another another top question from

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,410
Azkaban - what's the difference between

00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,850
a p' and apt-get and this was a really

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,490
uploaded question and i remember asking

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,050
myself this question when I started

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,520
learning Linux I'm working my way

00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,870
through the through different commands

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,540
that I find in different places and

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:24,250
sometimes I type sudo apt sometimes I

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:27,460
type sudo apt-get and why am i doing one

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,310
or the other so it's the most up voted

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,990
answer the one that the community agrees

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:35,110
on I've copied and pasted here it's this

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:38,560
long list of things this is a little

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,650
dense for a beginner so I have an

00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,160
analogy that I would like to make okay

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:48,640
imagine that you're a photographer an

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,990
expert photographer you know everything

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,670
there is to know about photography and

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,730
somebody asks you what's the difference

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,650
between these two photos you would

00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:58,420
probably say something you'd be really

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,430
excited to talk about your craft and

00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:05,080
you'd say something like well the

00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:07,780
lighting or or the composition or maybe

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,100
the aperture and I don't I don't really

00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,720
know what aperture means I just know

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,330
that it's a camera word so if you're a

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,220
camera pro and I've embarrassed myself

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,940
tell me quietly after the presentation

00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,890
please okay but you get really into the

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,870
technical details but for the beginner I

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:25,810
would like to point out that if you look

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:28,470
closely one of these pictures is a horse

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:33,000
and the other one's a zebra and

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:35,290
sometimes that's all I'm really asking

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,210
that's what I really wanted to know I

00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:40,210
don't need the long technical

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,340
explanation I just want to know why am I

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,760
using apt and why am I using app to get

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,730
so for the beginner as far as the

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,510
beginner is concerned it's pretty much

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,150
the same thing

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:54,970
one of them's just like the 2.0 a skin

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,560
over top of the other if you will but

00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,360
it's it's really hard to get to this

00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,770
answer when the entire community is

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:06,910
lifting up the really nuanced complex

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:09,970
answer for experts so this is it's not a

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,270
problem it's just difficult for the

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,270
uninitiated

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,030
so we've got all of these problems being

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,500
stuck in beginner land is really boring

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,090
it's really hard to decipher some of the

00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,250
commands what am i doing and why am i

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,180
doing it everything looks really dense I

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,650
don't know the difference between

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:31,180
distros I eventually if you're working

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,040
from a desktop you're going to find out

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,870
oh yeah wait a minute this wasn't built

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,700
for desktops this was built for servers

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,760
and that's why I have to worry about

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,870
commands like who are who is on my

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,210
computer it's really hard to untangle

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:50,100
all of this stuff and you're not even

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:54,000
sure what questions to ask sometimes so

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:58,150
here are the questions you should ask

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,520
what am i doing why am i doing this what

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,760
does this command do and when I ask that

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,490
question what I really mean is what is

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,140
the syntax how does the syntax work do I

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:11,020
really need to understand all of this

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,490
before I keep moving forward and maybe

00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:19,000
the most important question is am I

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:22,180
going to break something so I'm going to

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,470
do a case study on permissions because

00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,210
if you're coming from windows

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,470
permissions are just that annoying thing

00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,270
that pop up every time you try to

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:33,850
install something you don't even really

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,960
know why it pops up and I'm the only one

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,660
that uses the computer

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,120
I am the admin why do I have to keep

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,940
getting permission for anything that I

00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,630
want to install so every beginner book

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,130
for Linux has got something to do with

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,350
permissions it keeps coming up it must

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:57,100
be important so let's use this as our

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:59,920
space Cudi's is our case study for the

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,160
questions to ask for a beginner so I

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,700
remember the first time I saw

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:12,280
permissions I had no idea what CH mo d

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,140
meant and I called it Chi mod and I

00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,270
didn't know much about

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:20,580
read/write/execute and I had no idea

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:24,490
what six six six six six four stood for

00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:27,670
this is a strange command

00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,370
for the uninitiated so the first

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,920
question is what am i doing as in what

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,460
am I actually trying to accomplish

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,260
trying to understand it in the abstract

00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,960
we're going to change the permissions so

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:45,780
that we can limit which users and

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,780
programs can have access to which files

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:56,550
okay that's good enough why do I want to

00:28:49,300 --> 00:29:01,510
do that so why am I doing this

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:03,430
in the case of permissions a little bit

00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:05,050
of research online maybe a couple of

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,680
textbooks you open up to the permissions

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:11,500
chapter and they say well a lot of

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,790
programs can affect your system in

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,830
unexpected ways

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,500
so permissions are kind of up there as a

00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,850
safeguard to keep things from happening

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,770
in unexpected ways and this is

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:25,690
especially important if you're a

00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:28,150
beginner so it can mitigate the

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:31,180
unexpected that's a good enough answer

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,920
for now I think I can move on what does

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,030
this command do and this part feels

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:41,500
really good because you start to

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:43,750
demystify it a little bit Chi mod as it

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,030
turns out stands for change mode and

00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,290
this was also another lightbulb moment I

00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,380
was like well that's way less arbitrary

00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,450
that makes sense because before I knew

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,810
that before I knew mode was another word

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:58,710
for permissions I couldn't imagine what

00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:02,980
CH m OD had to do with the concept of

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,450
permissions so now that we know what

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:06,460
we're going to do and why we're going to

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,760
do it we can start to tackle these

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:13,450
questions change mode six-six for food

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,710
text food out text being the file that

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:23,560
we're going to change the permissions on

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:26,470
but what is 664 so 664 is a clever

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:30,190
system for assigning permissions like

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:33,940
which permission goes to which user or

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:36,500
group and

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,780
maybe that's an an overly concise

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,299
explanation for the fledgling arc honest

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:43,400
but the next point that I'm going to

00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:45,020
make excuse me from a full explanation

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,370
and I don't think anybody wants to

00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,840
listen to a full explanation right now

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,190
anyways that's not really the scope of

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,010
of the talk

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:56,120
do I need to understand this fully in

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:58,600
order to keep moving you can learn

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,660
rapidly if you're willing to accept that

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,140
understanding will come with time so if

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,760
you're not willing to turn the page

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,480
until you've mastered everything on the

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,510
current page and you fully understand it

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,120
you're gonna be stuck navigating

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:21,970
directories and copying files and that's

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:25,460
about it for a really long time so I

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:29,450
take a mental note I say okay change

00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:34,130
mode six six for some other numbers

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:35,690
sometimes and that helps me know which

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,190
person is going to get which permission

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,450
but I'm not going to remember any of

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,540
that stuff I'm just gonna remember what

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:44,960
page in my book it's on and just try to

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:47,020
remember that it's a thing but the last

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,970
question that you have to ask yourself a

00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,090
very important question is if I do this

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,290
wrong will I break my machine so if

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,020
you're gonna keep moving forward with a

00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,690
fuzzy understanding of how things work a

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,840
fuzzy understanding that you know will

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,610
clear up a time it's important to do a

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,150
little bit of research on the topic that

00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:10,970
you're tackling and in the case of

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:13,190
permissions it seems that everybody

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:17,510
online everybody on Stack Overflow and

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,960
ask Ubuntu they all say change mode

00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:23,000
seven seven seven is for noobs it's bad

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,860
don't do it and I don't even have to

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,929
know why I just have to know oh man I

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:30,380
don't want to be a noob I'm not gonna do

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:31,880
that so at least for now that's going to

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:37,940
keep me safe it's going to keep me from

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:42,220
breaking my machine and that's enough to

00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,220
move forward so with our

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,840
move quick and try not to break things

00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:51,809
too badly philosophy we've taken kind of

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,250
a pretty serious topic for beginners

00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,770
something that comes up in every

00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,659
beginner textbook we've condensed it to

00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:02,250
five points this is enough this is

00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:04,679
enough to move forward I've learned that

00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,770
permissions are a thing everyone online

00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,200
says they're important the syntax is

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,240
kind of like you see fours sixes and

00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,159
sevens like the number five in there

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,169
it's a clever system I don't have to get

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,470
it yet it's okay I get it enough to move

00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:21,900
forward and I don't think I need change

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,270
mode right now but I get the main point

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:29,059
and just a super important mental note

00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:33,270
don't use change mode 777 otherwise

00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:35,429
otherwise I'm a noob this is enough to

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:41,760
hold on to until you get the chance to

00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:43,919
make a memorable episode so imagine the

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,530
beginner working their way through this

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,210
they get enough of an understanding next

00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:51,799
thing you want to learn is how to make a

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:54,600
shell script or something like that and

00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,720
you type out your script you want to run

00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,030
it try to execute it it doesn't work so

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,919
you go online to Stack Exchange and you

00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,390
say why won't my script execute and

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,559
somebody says well you need to change

00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,950
the permissions you need to change the

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,609
mode you're like oh oh that's what

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,940
that's for

00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:14,970
and suddenly it clicks so if you were

00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,119
still sticking around in the permissions

00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,649
chapter of your textbook you would never

00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,599
ever never have had the opportunity to

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,639
actually use permissions in a real

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,419
meaningful way to create an episodic

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,429
memory so getting enough to move forward

00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,810
and then moving on is going to increase

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,070
everything you've got in your toolkit

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,020
and that's what Linux is all about

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,200
they're all of these tools that work

00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,200
together

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:48,290
on the subject of learning resources the

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,139
first most important learning resource

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,190
that we learn about are the man pages

00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:58,550
and you're gonna have to get comfortable

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,470
using them obviously it is it is

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:04,220
important but in my opinion it's it's a

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:06,440
really hard place to learn from so it

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,840
kind of feels like information overload

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,830
and commands aren't really organized

00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,900
into most useful or common idioms that

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,430
everybody else seems to know it's

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,200
organized alphabetically and it's really

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:22,490
hard to piece that stuff together so as

00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:24,830
a learning resource I I recommend

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,440
referencing it and don't don't feel

00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,600
discouraged if you're a beginner if you

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,420
are one of the people who installed

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,640
Linux earlier this month and and every

00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,050
YouTube video you watch for beginners

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,060
say like oh you've got to learn how to

00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,290
use the man pages like it's it's hard at

00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,030
first and that's okay don't beat

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,720
yourself up over it you'll get the hang

00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:48,560
of it understanding will come with time

00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,690
so I would feel pretty stupid if I got

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,609
up here and like exclaimed like guys you

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,940
can learn anything on YouTube it's

00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:58,130
amazing but youtube is a serious

00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,840
resource for learning especially for

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,310
self-taught people but it it can be

00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,260
really tricky because there's a lot of

00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:06,500
really bad YouTube videos out there I

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,300
don't want to sit through a 15 minute

00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,310
video that has a click Beatty title like

00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,810
ten commands everybody needs to know and

00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:17,540
like the first one is like LS I could I

00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,580
could get ten commands everybody needs

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,280
to know from a click Beatty article and

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,170
all the time it would take me is however

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,680
long it takes for all the ads and

00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,650
pop-ups to load so as far as YouTube

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,290
channels go I do like I can recommend

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,570
hack tip they've got a series called

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,160
Linux terminal 101 so if you are like

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,970
the beginner level that I'm talking

00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,500
about right now

00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:41,450
I think this channel there's a really

00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,430
good job of it adhering to some of the

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:46,220
techniques kind of understanding what's

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,920
going on before teaching you a bunch of

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,570
commands which is one of the most

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,210
important parts of

00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,750
creating an understanding of your your

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:59,870
workspace another level up from that the

00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,590
Linux man this is probably better for

00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,700
people that are in my assisted min or

00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:08,240
servers or mainframes or something like

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:13,220
that it's a level up but it is it's all

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:15,560
consistently reliable information I'm

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,310
I'm a huge fan of books and learning

00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,850
from books

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,310
so if books work well for you I

00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:24,500
recommend getting on on github.com

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:28,640
there's a github called ebook foundation

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,680
that's just full of free ebooks that you

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,840
can get your hands on on pretty much

00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,600
every subject in computer science it's

00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,850
full of really good information if you

00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,010
don't know what humble bundle is Humble

00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,170
Bundle comm is a website where you can

00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,510
buy I guess

00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,040
software packages really when it first

00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,530
came onto the scene people were really

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,050
raving about getting a bunch of games

00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,150
off of it but they've really moved in

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:57,470
the direction of book packages as well

00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:01,700
and back in July they had no starch

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:03,080
press Linux humble bundle and I grabbed

00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,890
that really quick and it had a lot of

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,110
really good books in it so I think

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,800
they've got two bundles up right now

00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:15,760
that are programming related I don't

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,380
know if a lot of people here are

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,990
programming but there's head first

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,410
series that's available in Humble Bundle

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:26,600
right now that that's really good

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,870
introductory level things and there's

00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,020
also like a makers as berry pie book kit

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:36,290
but I recommend keeping your eyes on on

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,520
humblebundle and I really like pretty

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,460
much everything that I've read from no

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,190
starch press you kind of get from the

00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,380
from the title what level it's at you

00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,850
know if it says beginner Linux on it

00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,760
it's it's going to be really good for

00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,500
you and if some of the some of the book

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,140
titles might be a little bit more

00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,120
advanced but skim through them and it's

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,400
really easy to digest the information

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:06,510
that they

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:08,789
got there so finding a community really

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,770
any place online where people are

00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:13,200
talking about this stuff my thought

00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,180
process on this is if you want to learn

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,329
a second language it's recommended like

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,829
in an ideal world you can go to a

00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:21,960
country move to a country where that

00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,059
target language is being spoken but the

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,640
cool thing about Linux is the target

00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:28,410
language is spoken online and if you're

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
on your computer you're you're online

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,829
you're there as soon as you start using

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,059
Linux you're in the home country of

00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:39,480
Linux so I think everybody knows how to

00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:41,130
find online communities where you're

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,039
communicating with people message boards

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,450
where you can chat I don't need to say

00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:48,180
like Oh guys you can talk to people and

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:50,549
read it about whatever like we already

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,859
know that but my real point is it's an

00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:55,799
important thing to do so hacker news is

00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:58,230
not a website about Linux at all but the

00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:00,150
level of discussion happening there it's

00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,430
a bunch of people who are literate on

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:04,950
this subject and it just it happens

00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:07,559
fluently and you start to get an

00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,390
impression of these things and even if

00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,579
you don't really know what's going on

00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,279
just getting an impression can help it

00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:16,650
be a little bit less mystified when you

00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:19,950
get to that subject later so I really

00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:23,640
recommend making an intentional effort

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:27,450
to just start digesting some communities

00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:34,099
online where the discussion in computer

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:36,119
science is happening so Stack Exchange

00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:38,579
obviously this is kind of a learning

00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,220
resource and a community and I'm I'm a

00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:43,289
I'm a programmer and I have Stack

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:49,039
Exchange open on one window at all times

00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:52,339
at my at my workplace and there's

00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:55,410
limitless really good information and

00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:58,470
there it's vetted by the community so

00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:00,390
you can hear discussion both endpoints I

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:04,109
did have some examples up today about

00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:06,059
how intimidating the discussion on Stack

00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:07,710
Exchange can be there's a lot of really

00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,539
good beginner stuff there too so just

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,729
finding the materials and feeling

00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:15,989
confident in approaching them is an

00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:23,389
important an important step to the

00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:23,389
learning process so how to stay in shape

00:41:23,779 --> 00:41:30,359
command-line cardio this is a this is an

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,429
idea that I got from Brad traversée who

00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,649
does web development videos

00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:36,779
he's got a YouTube channel and he sells

00:41:34,649 --> 00:41:39,559
them on I think Coursera or something

00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:44,399
like that but he had a video called

00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:46,709
JavaScript cardio and he just went into

00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:49,769
the console and started just working in

00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:51,509
JavaScript he wasn't writing code he was

00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:53,729
just practicing being good at writing

00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:57,599
code and my background is in classical

00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:59,339
music performance and really it's not

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,619
it's something clicked with me at this

00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:05,130
point it's not really about having

00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:08,339
written nice code the goal is to be good

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:10,109
at writing it so working really hard and

00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:11,249
writing a whole bunch of stuff once and

00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:13,079
getting it perfect

00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:14,519
where you've got a shaky understanding

00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,739
and all of this stuff that's not really

00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,089
what we're looking for here we want to

00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:19,859
find a way that we can actually practice

00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,659
it and this is this is really good

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:25,229
anytime you've got a command line in

00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:28,469
front of you you can practice so we want

00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:30,599
to practice every day whenever I get to

00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:32,789
my computer or my workstation I run

00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:34,589
through a couple of commands that I keep

00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:38,219
on a notepad next to me make it the

00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:44,880
first thing that you do and no command

00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:48,149
is too trivial musician would never say

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,399
oh man I'm so tired of practicing the C

00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:52,109
major scale you can always be better at

00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:56,159
something you can always be more

00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:59,789
efficient so even if you write on your

00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:03,779
practice cardio script your your to-do

00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:07,380
list for your cardio make an alias in

00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:10,079
bash alias script that's a useful thing

00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,809
to do if you're working in your in your

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,309
new virtual environment and you want to

00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:15,659
change your aliases real quick if you

00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:16,859
can just slap that out on the keyboard

00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:19,049
and switch it around really quick you're

00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,639
gonna you're gonna look like a narc

00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:22,799
honest you're gonna feel way more

00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,160
confident and getting some of these more

00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:25,740
trivia

00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:28,200
things out of the way it's only going to

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,080
help you tackle the bigger the next step

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:37,100
so this is an important thing on any

00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:42,570
level so I actually I wanted to show you

00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:49,650
my notes that I put online on the

00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:55,740
subject of Arcana sorry I lost internet

00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:59,790
though okay I think we're back so if you

00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:04,410
go to my website which was not designed

00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:07,070
for 4:3 aspect ratio be benzio if you

00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:12,150
scroll down to the bottom there's linux

00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:13,980
command line cardio button here and this

00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,510
is not this is nothing fancy this is

00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,480
just my notes that I've tossed online

00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,510
this is an example of the way that I've

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,070
managed to find the practice routine how

00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,620
can I get better at Linux how can I

00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:29,430
spend deliberate time improving my Linux

00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,630
skills so I've tried to decipher my

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:33,240
notes to be a little bit more friendly

00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,550
to those who want to skim through it but

00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,840
really what I recommend is is doing this

00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,700
on your own

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,140
when you're learning through these

00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,780
resources and you learn glob take a

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,400
couple of notes about what it is and

00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,590
some of the syntax how to use it and

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,100
then come up with exercises for yourself

00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:56,220
or even copy exercises it exercises out

00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:59,940
of the book so every day I go through

00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,260
this same script the ones that I'm using

00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,410
now are a little bit more advanced than

00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:09,120
this but I keep this same to-do list

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,690
where I set some of these goals for

00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,030
myself

00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,340
and what's happening is it's it's really

00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:18,810
the same thing as when you're practicing

00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,810
music you start off with just a scale

00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,220
and it's the same scale every day and

00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,730
when you start to get more confident in

00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:30,810
it you start to explore the limitations

00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:32,390
of this scale so input/output is a good

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,640
example

00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:40,599
you know how to how to redirect

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:43,609
something into a file I started with

00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,619
only and strictly what was here and

00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:47,119
didn't understand it very well but I

00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:49,010
knew that it would come with time and

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,289
then I started to experiment with it and

00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,569
I was like I've I've seen some other

00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:55,519
ways that I can use these commands let

00:45:53,569 --> 00:46:00,019
me try and test the boundaries of this a

00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:01,789
little bit and after time using only

00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:04,430
this same little to-do list that I've

00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:06,380
made for myself I gain confidence and

00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:09,529
understanding i when I'm actually

00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,789
working later that day and I say oh man

00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:14,900
I really want to pipe something into

00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:18,369
less which sorry I know that's Arcana if

00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:22,099
you are B if you're actually a very

00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:23,480
early beginner but having these tools at

00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,720
your fingertips and having done them

00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,309
earlier that day will help you find uses

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,569
for them in your workflow

00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:37,210
later that day so this is just a simple

00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:40,009
example but it's kind of like I

00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,569
recommend checking this out and then

00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:48,109
making your own because this is how

00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:51,680
you're going to improve quickly with

00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:55,609
that being said I've got a references

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,190
page for some of the studies that I've

00:46:55,609 --> 00:47:02,269
looked at and talked about here today

00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,789
and I would like to thank everybody for

00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:05,540
coming to see my presentation so thank

00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:12,040
you

00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:12,040
