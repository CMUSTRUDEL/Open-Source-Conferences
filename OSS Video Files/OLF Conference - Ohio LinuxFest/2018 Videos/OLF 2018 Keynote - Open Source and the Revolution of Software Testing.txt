Description: 
	Software testing used to be a fairly static ordeal handled by a quality assurance team at a company. Reports were delivered to software engineers after the analysis was complete. During this time, most open source software also often relied upon companies to do internal testing and security analysis instead of running their own systems. Over the past five years we’ve seen a rise in the popularity of Continous Integration (CI) which has sparked a tremendous amount of innovation around on-demand testing triggered by developers themselves. Open source projects like Jenkins, Spinnaker, Artifactory, GitLab and more have risen to meet that demand.

These new software testing methods have also taken hold in open source projects. Many are now doing their own CI, whether they run their own Jenkins infrastructure like the OpenStack project or are using integrations now available in the GitHub for popular proprietary CI systems like Travis CI and CircleCI. Major projects like Kubernetes are opening their conferences with calls for improved code coverage in testing and stressing the importance of CI.

In this talk we’ll explore this new ecosystem of software testing and the impact it has had on open source software development. We’ll also dive into some of the options available for integrating CI into an open source project you’re involved with, including the cultural and practical risks around the use of a fully open source platform you host yourself versus the proprietary hosted offerings.
