Title: OLF 2018 - Getting Kids Involved with Computing
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Have you ever wondered how to engage children with technology? Do you want to guide them down the path to open source?
Kids don’t often care about the higher level implications of things. They just want to play games and have fun. In this talk we’ll cover various age groups and what some strategies you might employ to get kids used to linux and open source.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,569
so this talk is about kids in computing

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,610
and I wanted to talk about what this

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,950
isn't and if you guys get up and walk

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,259
away I am not offended because often

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,790
times there's a disjoint between what

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,710
I'm trying to talk about and what people

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,439
are expecting so there's no offense

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,890
taken if this isn't for you that's okay

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,760
so this isn't prescriptive it's not a

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,849
guide to follow to help your children

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,180
it's not authoritative while my wife is

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:37,620
a licensed teacher this comes from no

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,170
kind of curriculum it's not aimed aimed

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,120
at high school or above so that's my

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,570
other disclaimer I figured those kids

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,000
are plenty capable of finding stuff that

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,030
interests them on their own and I don't

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,399
have kids that old yet this is not

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,680
related to social media so if you try

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,600
and look this stuff up online you'll

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
find a lot of like Oh have your kids

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,989
check in via Facebook or post their

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,620
thing via Twitter and I think that's

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,600
ridiculous

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,299
so it has nothing to do with social

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,340
media it's not based on any kind of

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,070
curriculum and it's not an advertisement

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,100
so I'm actually gonna be talking about

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,479
like specific games or other things that

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,939
we use but it's not meant as an

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,990
advertisement it is our opinion so I

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:23,909
co-designed this with my wife I just

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,530
happen to be one giving the talk I put

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,360
the slides together and did the editing

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,600
and whatever she teaches our children

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,270
and I kind of help her navigate the

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,470
internet and other stuff like that this

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,520
is a show-and-tell

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,500
so that's why I expect some people to

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,720
come in and some people to leave because

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,619
the purpose of this is when you're

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,450
searching for information about whatever

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,130
you get a lot of junk or you get

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,810
advertisements or whatever so I wanted

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,189
to show you the stuff that we have

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,439
bought what does it look like because

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,090
some of it has like its premium so you

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,890
get the first ten levels for free or

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,409
whatever what do you get afterwards

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,570
because sometimes I'm specifically

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,210
thinking of a couple of the logic games

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,590
what the first ten levels are are not at

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,629
all what the game was like and so I

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,050
wanted to give you kind of my experience

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:16,130
and we paid for the stuff so

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:21,560
here's what it looks like yep

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,410
yeah yes we are yeah

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,110
so this is a suggestion for resources

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,900
that's that's my main thing we spend a

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:33,860
lot of time looking around because there

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,930
is so much crap out there so we have dug

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,400
around and dug around it this is a

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,700
culmination of probably about two years

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,200
just not concentrated but like finding

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,880
out this thing didn't work but this one

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,990
worked really well and that kind of

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,230
stuff so it's more suggestion and it's

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,460
based on our practical experience so

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,380
like I said my wife is a licensed

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,780
teacher she taught for seven years

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,280
before we had kids and she decided that

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,550
we're gonna keep him at home

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,470
so she kind of evaluated it from an

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,960
educational standpoint and I looked at

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,030
it for more is this technically relevant

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,620
sort of thing because some of its logic

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,880
and some of its to programming and some

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:19,160
of its just generic education holy crap

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:24,860
so we are the parents of two boys and so

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:26,870
I've six and two so this is important

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,240
because we don't have girls so I don't

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,709
know how these things test for keeping

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,840
girls interests and stuff like that so

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:37,340
that's my bias and we're not an apple

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,930
household we're not a Windows household

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,110
I don't know anything about those things

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,010
so this is Linux Android and Raspberry

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,180
Pi the things that we have so some of

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,440
the stuff we use and I'm just gonna rip

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,610
through these because I've actually

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:56,780
start talking about them these these

00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:00,110
first ones are so coda Pilar's code cart

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,780
crash course and scratch jr. or all apps

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,430
you can get them on the computer some of

00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,320
these but we use the Android app we also

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,390
looked so some of this is hands-on so

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,880
the circuit board for kids I have a demo

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,250
of my son actually using this so it's

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,500
actual like you get a board and your

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,040
snaps circuits together and work through

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,440
that and I also have a computer that I

00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,280
just let my kid like rip apart like

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,820
literally and you

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,540
see and its various typing games and

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,580
stuff like that we also used OBS I don't

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,040
really cover that here but that's open

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,800
broadcast studio my six-year-old son

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,230
loves to pretend he's a youtube star so

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,440
that was something that immediately got

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,230
his attention so and then we have some

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,450
stuff that we're considering and it

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,980
didn't move into like the recommendation

00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,020
phase because we haven't used it enough

00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,890
but things we're considering that we

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,900
like so little bits is another this is a

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,520
physical thing that where you get stuff

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,380
that snaps together to make kind of

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,940
electronic parts and again it's it's

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,570
supposed to get kids interested in

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,340
circuits and stuff like that we use mind

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,110
tests all the time which is the open

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,030
source version of Minecraft I am not

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,860
sold on its educational value so that's

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,250
why it's in there like it were in the

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,919
consideration phase there's a book

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,030
called Raspberry Pi for kids great book

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,370
it's a little bit dated

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,250
it has some really interesting stuff not

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:32,479
at my kids level this is more like a

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:34,450
eight to ten-year-old kid level mmm-hmm

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,820
and there was this interesting project

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,520
related to the Raspberry Pi where the

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,919
dad makes his Christmas lights like

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,380
bounce to the music so they play any

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,270
kind of music and through the Raspberry

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,979
Pi and the lights kind of went to the

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,310
beat I thought that was neat so did my

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,640
kid so that's why it's here there's a

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,620
game called seven billion humans and I

00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,200
won't talk much about that but I'll show

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,300
you that at the end if we get that far

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,640
so you can interrupt at any time because

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,100
this is not a prescriptive thing I hope

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,990
to encourage communication and like I'm

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,190
not the expert I just have two kids I

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,960
worked for Red Hat so I have the

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,350
technology background and my wife's the

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,850
teacher so we kind of have that mash so

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,160
if you guys have questions or you just

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,900
want to comment great like let's let's

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,950
start talking like a community right

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,490
like sharing ideas so with that we'll

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,470
start talking about the mobile apps so

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,660
coda pillars is even though it's made by

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,450
fisher-price it's actually pretty good I

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,010
was very surprised initially when you

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,539
look it up it kind of looks like it's

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,860
tied with the toy but we don't have the

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,300
toy

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,259
just downloaded the app and it's still

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,620
pretty good it's aimed at preschool it's

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,180
definitely not for kids in grade one

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,759
because of the cutesy graphics the logic

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,340
is good but the graphics definitely turn

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,259
it off so I'll show you what that is but

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,409
an encouraging counter counting and

00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:02,979
logic and it really does go from like

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:07,449
really simple to really complex and it's

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:16,029
free so this is what it looks like on

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:17,830
the very simple level and I'm not

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,120
turning those arrows to be turned for

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,250
themselves you just have to figure out

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,889
which one to do that's why it works

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,469
really well for little kids because they

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,360
can literally just take a turn and drop

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,759
it in place and if it's correct it will

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,150
turn the right way for you so that was

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,490
simple this is one of the intermediate

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,310
levels and you see the right need to

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,620
turn for itself and you get into

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:53,669
concepts of like I need to do a special

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:53,669
action you get the point on that slide

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,960
and he reaches the goal and everything's

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:05,680
happy the next slide is a little bit

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,449
tedious but it serves to show you how

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,879
complex it is because you get multiple

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,009
popping in here so this is something

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,330
that my six-year-olds in trouble with

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,419
but he doesn't want to play it because

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,419
it's got the caterpillar and I have a

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:21,370
solution for that after this but you can

00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,500
see I've got different turns in this

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,750
level there's a leaf which tells him to

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,750
eat he has to do some special action

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,740
and so it's all about figuring out doing

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,810
the right actions because over here you

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,600
still got to swim you got a dance you

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,070
know you get to a point where you unlock

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,810
all of his special moves and then you

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:47,240
have to figure out it becomes

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:48,980
straightforward which one to use and I

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,320
sped this off this is at like 80 times

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,440
speed because the game is stupid slow

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,240
and this clip was like four minutes long

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,940
before I sped it up and it's still like

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,620
a minute and a half but it really

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,280
entertains the two-year-old so there's

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,000
that so this is the favorite in the

00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,340
house this is code cards and this is a

00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,160
free / freemium one that we bought

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,280
because we really like this one so it's

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,870
done by these guys at oke I don't know

00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,450
how do you pronounce it it's it's a

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,020
tablet game I did look up it is on iOS

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,970
as well it's age 8 and below but

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,430
honestly some of this stuff it can get

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,920
quite complex and the purpose of that is

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,150
kind of like code cards or code two

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,730
pillars where you've got the caterpillar

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,080
but you got a car but this is one of

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,720
those cases where I wanted to show you

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,310
what the the end level on the freemium

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,960
is and what it looks like when you

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,180
actually pay to play the game because

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,280
they're different experiences so you'll

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,710
notice that I actually have color coding

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,450
hints here to tell me which direction

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,990
that I go like it lines up with the

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,540
color the color schemes here and this

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,150
made it really easy for to do the

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,540
premium levels because you don't have to

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:07,420
think you just have to match the color

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,420
and the car drives around and it's happy

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,030
you go to a more complex one and so

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,360
first I'm gonna show you how this is my

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:19,370
kid doing it he again I sped it up but

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,650
he's trying to figure out how does this

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,350
work and you'll notice that the

00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,600
direction that you hit the jumper on he

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,500
continues on so it works your logic and

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,570
so this is the same level but this is me

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,720
doing it so that you can actually beat

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,720
it

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,720
so you have to choose at each

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,430
intersection you have to choose a

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,900
direction or else it'll just like the

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,990
car parks itself every time there's a

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,000
decision to be made and he loves this

00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,430
game he's like 75 levels in and I

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
haven't seen the end of this one but you

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,610
can see how complicated it gets because

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,520
at one point he drove to the left on the

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,650
orange and couldn't he took him a really

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,180
long while to figure out why do I keep

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,040
crashing because the car is going to the

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,150
left and it hits the orange target and

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
then ends on the other orange target

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,800
continues going left until it goes off

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,050
the track so code carts is a big

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,500
favorite at our house both kids really

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:21,440
like that so there's something called

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,610
tinker and inside of tinker it has like

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,740
eight games in one

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,360
some of them are free and some of them

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,430
you have to pay for so this is another

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,430
one of those like sort of freemium ones

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:37,940
the totally free ones are actually

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:39,410
pretty good this one is more complex

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,030
than than the other two that I've showed

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,880
you because you start controlling things

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,860
like speed and distance and the number

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,360
of times you want to do that speed and

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:53,210
stuff like that so this is quite complex

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:56,300
and I show like failing a couple times

00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,490
and I show succeeding so you get you end

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:04,100
up with these things where you now have

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:07,730
blocks of code that are represented the

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:14,930
things end up locking together when you

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:15,890
do them right and it is it is similar to

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,780
scratch yep

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,630
and will cover a scratch although

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,180
because scratch is like really

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,970
open-ended and this this has a purpose

00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,380
right so this one holds the attention

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,640
over scratch because there's something

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,660
to do and I don't have to make it up

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:34,910
myself mm-hmm so on a more complex one

00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:37,250
you end up with like there's a repeat

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,980
block which I don't use I just wanted to

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,300
demonstrate like my kid would doesn't

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,790
understand the idea of the repeat block

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,059
so this is how he does this level we're

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,279
just like I can

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,579
just issue the same commands over and

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,249
over again this level actually

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,919
challenged me it took me like seven

00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:58,229
tries to get him across because what

00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,109
happens is you only have two actions

00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:03,029
you've got his speed and I touched the

00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:05,159
character and that's it so you have to

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:07,409
figure out how do I get him across in

00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,939
the proper timing while touching him so

00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,409
you touch and you wait and you touching

00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:12,839
you wait but maybe the first time you

00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:14,599
can roll for but the next time you can't

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,639
because four will roll you off the edge

00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:21,239
and so even at the end of this one I

00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,459
ended up failing because I rolled too

00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:27,329
far by the time I got the I got the coin

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:29,699
but rolled off the edge at the end so

00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:31,769
you're talking about scratch scratch jr.

00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:35,459
is a similar idea this is also a mobile

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:37,679
app and it's totally free it's free form

00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,589
which means there's absolutely no point

00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,919
to this game whatsoever which can be

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:46,799
very frustrating until I actually showed

00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,899
my son like an example of something you

00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,029
could do with it he completely did not

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:54,479
understand what you should do

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,909
it's supposed to be freeing like not

00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:59,399
constrict you to anything specific and

00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:01,469
again you control sounds and speeds and

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,799
all that kind of stuff so I made this

00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:06,899
little video of like a dragon and a baby

00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,489
and basically the dragon walks up and

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,819
roars it's a baby and the baby jumps and

00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:13,979
runs away and when I did this then it

00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:18,239
became interesting but beforehand like

00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:19,859
it was way too open for for my son who's

00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:26,069
actually fairly creative so I was

00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:28,439
surprised to see and the baby screams so

00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:30,389
you actually control actions by clicking

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,579
on each one of the things like so you've

00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:34,109
got you had a dragon up here and a baby

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,259
over here and each one of them had

00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:39,179
actions that they performed and you for

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,029
the baby to time properly you had to put

00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:44,429
a weight in so it's it actually is it is

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:47,159
the most complex of like the junior

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:49,649
games because you have to understand

00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,629
like I have to do this and then I have

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:53,129
to wait for the dragon to get to me

00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:57,029
before I actually make the action or

00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:58,879
else it all happens at the same time so

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,529
we talked about

00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:05,519
mobile apps and I wanted to talk a

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:08,399
little bit about computers themselves so

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,670
I realized when I became a father that

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,459
my son's watch everything that I do and

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,110
so I took advantage of that but part of

00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,059
that was also finding them something

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,299
interesting to watch this kind of

00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:26,279
educational this show cyberchase is

00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:30,389
highly educational but really it engages

00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,970
the kids so it implies cyberchase it it

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,589
takes place in the world of the Internet

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,569
and there is a bad guy that's always

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,850
trying to like destroy the Internet and

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,339
it's like 13 seasons long or something

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,259
it's been going for a very long time but

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,639
they deal with math as well as like

00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,239
computer concepts and things like that

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,889
so this is a good one where we can put

00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,079
this on for him and he feels like he's

00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:57,540
not learning and so we kind of like haha

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:59,670
it's still school hours so a big thing

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,589
that my dad didn't do with me was let us

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:06,329
engage he was always afraid that we were

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:08,339
gonna break stuff right and I wanted to

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:11,369
turn that on its head and let my kids

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,740
learn how to do things safely especially

00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:15,839
when it came to computers both of my

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,269
sons wanted to stick their fingers in

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,040
the fan I don't know why but the fans

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,100
were just like I have to stick my finger

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,670
in that fan and my oldest one actually

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,860
lost the tip of his finger doing that

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,929
but it's part of the exploration I was

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,069
there with him and so like you know we

00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,470
got a bandaid on it everything

00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:36,240
everything was fine but it's important

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,860
to allow your kids to engage with you

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,189
you don't have to do that with them if

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,379
you're not comfortable but when you when

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,970
you have them sit them on your lap or

00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:46,980
let them watch you like when I take my

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,809
computer apart to dust it or whatever he

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,929
asked me these things what's this what's

00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:54,499
that and and he absorbs them and I think

00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,499
that's quite amazing

00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:03,439
right here

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:17,060
and a CPU is right here so like the

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:20,990
heatsink gives the fan the hot air and

00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,980
then blows it away so like these are the

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,420
two that hood it holds like either the

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,880
two Rams and this is a set born set to

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,470
and set forwards it can you point to

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:41,380
them neither is that four sets do and

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:43,910
separate well it's a using it right here

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:53,450
I'm not coaching him by the way he's

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:54,680
just with me boys doing his thing he

00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:08,770
says I don't know what that one's called

00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:08,770
folks and he looks PCI what are these

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:22,070
yep BCI right how small it does PCI go

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:23,360
that one's probably PCI one PCI one Pei

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,580
Pei

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,390
he's so he just loves to sit down like

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:34,370
he asked me things like that he's five

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:36,410
in this one he's six now hmm so getting

00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,850
along to scratch which scratch and

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:42,860
scratch jr. are different scratch is

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,270
free it's available you you don't even

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,620
have to install it you can actually do

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,970
everything on the website because it's

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,200
all drag-and-drop but you can also

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,360
install it as a program on your computer

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,070
it has all of the stuff of scratch jr.

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,240
except in my opinion it's much better

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:03,890
now even logically laid out it allows

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,540
you to do like really complex things you

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,720
can actually you can write like actual

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,240
video games with this so I found I

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,580
didn't do this I found this so this is

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,770
written in scratch it's simplified but I

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:22,310
thought of a sentiment

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:25,170
[Music]

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:28,410
you've got like it keeps high score

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,960
you've got life it has all kinds of

00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,250
other stuff and eventually I'll spare

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,780
you the rest of it but Koopa comes out

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,940
and starts throwing hammers at you and

00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,460
you collect coins and it actually gets

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,950
pretty intense and this is the sum total

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,520
of that program all of that is right

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:47,220
there so with scratch for your older

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,780
kids Matteo will probably he's my older

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,550
one he'll probably get into this when he

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,490
gets older because he can just drag

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,860
blocks around and and just generally

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,290
have a good time

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,980
so this is targeted human resource

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:04,020
machine is a game that I really like I

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,330
play it and it starts off really simply

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,840
but it gets really complex really

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:12,150
quickly and it really works logic math

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,490
and trial and error even for adults if

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,770
you go and like if you go on youtube and

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,170
watch people play this almost everybody

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,670
fails the first time on whatever that

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,640
they're demoing because it can be quite

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,830
complex you can get this on Steam or on

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,580
the humble store and good ol games in a

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,410
few other places it's lots of fun this

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,810
is based on assembly the assembly

00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,610
programming language so you don't need

00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,950
to know what that is but if you are

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,560
technical that will kind of help explain

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,480
this so in this this is the very first

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,760
level and your objective I'll save you

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,450
the reading is to make the word bug from

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,790
these right here so you have to tell him

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,530
pick up the letter in which box and

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:57,480
spell it properly and drop it in the

00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:00,300
outbox and then you secede and it does

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,790
things like checks to see like it has an

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,030
ideal number of moves that you make and

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:09,540
then the green is me so yellow is the

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:11,850
ideal the green is me but it gets more

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,840
complex so in this one I'm doing math so

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:17,580
the purpose of this one is you have to

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,230
put stuff in the center and then figure

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,290
out in which order you need to subtract

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:25,800
them to make your goal and you'll see I

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,870
it gets into like using jumps when it

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,010
comes back so the jump command right

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,960
here means basically

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:35,940
put it in a loop like that and it this

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,680
one actually took me several tries just

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,380
to understand the instructions to get

00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,390
him to do the math properly and you can

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,740
it has like a speed up down here so if

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,780
you think you've got it right you can

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,770
just crank the speed up and he just goes

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,720
crazy doing all the math so that's human

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,880
resource machines I play this game I

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,530
like it he likes it but will get

00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,360
frustrated after it gets a little too

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:04,740
intense for him so both of my boys even

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,510
the two-year-old likes to type so there

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,250
are a lot of good websites for this I

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,110
don't really list them because there are

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,990
like they're basically a dime a dozen

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,500
for that but I did want to show tux

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,240
typing

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,770
because we're out of a linux conference

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,420
and so why not

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:24,180
I found that tux typing can be good but

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,890
it also can be very hard because you

00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,750
can't necessarily make out the letters

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,400
very quickly and I'll show you I have a

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,360
demo this is me doing the typing so

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,710
there are different game modes

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,310
I like I've sped it up like I'm in the

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,310
level

00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:01,460
and there it's destroyed because they're

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,140
in like little blue comets and like the

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,399
animation gets in the way I started to

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,779
mess up because it couldn't tell what

00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:07,370
letters they were and sometimes the

00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,809
words come down and interleave with each

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,010
other and you couldn't tell like if the

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,440
letters are supposed to be joined

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,279
together so at the higher levels this

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:19,940
one is challenging just because of the

00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:21,830
the graphics but he likes it because he

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,510
makes a laser go zap every time he gets

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,890
to the correct and my youngest one he

00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,289
just loves it he just like bang it on

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:30,289
the keyboard just to try to get the

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:32,649
little gun to shoot off so they both

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,970
really like tux typing

00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:37,070
so we talked a little bit about

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,750
circuitry in the Raspberry Pi now and

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,389
we're kind of we're ripping right along

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:50,029
because apparently everybody is

00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:51,679
enthralled or sleeping so yeah I haven't

00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:53,899
there hasn't been a whole lot of

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,929
activity on on tux typing in general I

00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:58,669
think the last update was like 2009 they

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:02,809
kind of consider it a finished product

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:04,100
from my understanding of it yeah it has

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,990
several other bugs like it was written

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,820
from in a time where two screens weren't

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:10,130
a thing so it spans across both screens

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,529
and that makes it I have five screens

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:17,960
and it's like all over the place I can't

00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:19,669
even click on things so by the way

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,929
people who have stuck your hand up if

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,809
you want to come and get something like

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,950
I said there's the USB things and the

00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,630
shirts and stuff like that you're

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,580
welcome to it this stuff has to go I

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:34,370
can't take it home so hmm so snap

00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,870
circuits this is a fun one this is kind

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,510
of what I alluded to earlier he loves

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:41,809
this both of the kids do because it's

00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,399
really easy to use it's a little more

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:46,130
expensive because they're very durable

00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,990
like I have no fear of giving this to my

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,000
son my two-year-old who's just gonna

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,789
chomp on it because it's durable enough

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,820
to do that so because of that it's a

00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:57,139
little more expensive for us it has

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,260
really easy to follow instructions

00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:02,120
because they each kit has like I can

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,250
build 50 projects or whatever so it

00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,130
comes with a little book and they're

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,919
very picturised so my six-year-old two

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:14,570
reeds but only sort of reads he can

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,160
follow the book to sort of and he loves

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,080
it because you get a sense of

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,850
gratification when you if you flip the

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,230
positive and the negative charges around

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,940
and nothing happens and then you flip it

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,429
back in the fan spins that's that's

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:54,440
awesome for a little kid okay we're

00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:56,809
gonna try another complicated circuit we

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,080
don't let him use the sound module super

00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,220
annoying it's just like this high pitch

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,280
so it's sitting on the table but he

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,590
can't use it but both of the kids really

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,419
like it because the fan will change

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,799
colors if you've got the positive and

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:11,120
negative or the reversed and the same

00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,820
thing with the lights like the lights

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,830
change color and you can see it's really

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,659
easy aside from the fact that my

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,280
two-year-old sitting right up here which

00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,750
is why my wife is hovering so close

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:30,490
because he wants to stick his finger in

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:30,490
that fan all the time yes they are

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,700
absolutely and what you can't see but

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,690
down on each end there's a plus and a

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,740
negative so once they start putting like

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,600
recognizing that they don't even have to

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,130
know what that means but he can start

00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,870
assembling like that's how he's able to

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,610
figure out I need to turn the light on

00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:53,830
by doing it like this

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,940
and it can be a teachable moment like

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,670
you can sit down and try and explain

00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:04,500
electronics to them or you can just let

00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:09,670
them play around with it yes it does yep

00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:12,150
yep it is it's awesome it is it is well

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,150
worth the money

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,450
yes you're absolutely right and like I

00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,920
said they're they're easy to follow -

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,290
right I can give the book to him and he

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,540
can kind of click things together so we

00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,690
really like that we like snap circuits a

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,930
lot we're a little less gung-ho on

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:37,330
little bits so that this gets into the

00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:42,790
like resources to consider part of the

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:44,680
presentation yeah

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,780
yep there are that that's why it ranges

00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,070
from like 30 to 120 dollars so like

00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,470
there's all kinds of different stuff you

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,300
can it's on Amazon we get it from the

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,250
local teacher store because my wife gets

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,530
a discount but you know you can get it

00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:04,270
lots of places yeah they all go together

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:06,190
yep my two-year-old uses this yeah

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,250
because the the thing that powers it is

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,720
just three Triple A batteries and you

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,630
screw it in so that they can't pull it

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,310
out so he can't like lick it and do

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,190
something dangerous for it for himself

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,930
they're far enough apart that he's never

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,020
had any problem with it I've never seen

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:27,400
an issue Matteo started getting

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:30,490
interested around age four though so

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,350
little bits it is easy to use this one's

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,350
more expensive because it gets more

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,660
complex so as an adult little bits is

00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,810
cool like I I legitimately think little

00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:43,390
bits is neat it also has easy to follow

00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:45,880
instructions and it also has a good

00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,530
sense of gratification but the problem

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,600
with this and you'll see it in the video

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,570
you they snap together on their own so

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,040
there's like with the snap circuits you

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,660
actually have to figure that out with

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,180
this one you can't stick them in the

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,580
wrong way and so that's why I'm a little

00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,740
tossed up about this because this has

00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,480
more potential for useful projects where

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,880
the other one has like you're actually

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,320
gonna learn Plus does this - does this

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,160
and if I stick them in the wrong way I

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,880
get nothing

00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,130
right so and it's magnetized which is

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,840
neat so this little module as magnets

00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,880
built into the ends so you can't connect

00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,620
them the wrong way instead they click

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,290
themselves into position for you making

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,850
simple circuit building a snap now if we

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,320
connect an LED to the end of the button

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,940
module you can see that in less than

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,590
five seconds we've made a flashlight

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,570
that works each time we press the button

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,400
if we switch out the button with the

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,710
sound trigger module we can turn on the

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,090
light with a snap for a clap all right

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,280
let's take this to the next level with

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,780
the cloud bit module this little piece

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,130
snaps just about anything to the

00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,140
Internet and you'll see how it works in

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,940
just a second now if we bring in a

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,650
remote trigger and this owl puppet I

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,420
found laying in the kid's playroom we

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:51,430
can build a secret circuit to monitor

00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,990
the kids this little device is gonna let

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,000
us know when someone's using a remote

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,650
control so let's snap some wires to

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,540
either side of the sensor then snap it

00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,450
to the cloud bit module making this

00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,100
circuit Wi-Fi compatible I chose to snap

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,480
my circuit to a mounting board for

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,190
convenience and added a little bit of

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,530
duct tape to keep the 9-volt battery

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,210
beside the circuit our remote detector

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,580
circuit is complete and now all we have

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,440
to do is hide it you can see the sensor

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,090
hides pretty well in the forehead and to

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,250
get it all working all we need to do is

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,840
throw the power switch all right let's

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,880
go ahead and tuck everything inside the

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,370
puppet so it's snug and secure and

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,960
completely concealed now I set this one

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,580
beside the TV in our kids playroom

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,440
because our kids are in the habit of

00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,270
sneaking up to watch TV after we've gone

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,950
to bed the difference now is that when

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,300
they press any button on the remote the

00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,130
sensor in the puppet triggers the

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,780
circuit and sends a text message to my

00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:43,600
phone letting us know that some little

00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:46,060
body is watching TV yeah so obviously

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,560
this wasn't me and I have like a page of

00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,540
sources in case you're wondering where

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,120
some of these videos are pulled from I'm

00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,820
not trying to run afoul of copyright but

00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,800
yeah you can see why I really like snap

00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,870
circuits and I'm not quite sure about

00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,220
little bits neither of us are like it

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,929
has really good potential

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:12,190
but he's not is he learning anything

00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:15,039
about this I don't know right there oh I

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,080
didn't know that so little bits is worth

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,820
checking out especially if you're not

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,590
trying to learn something about circuits

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,299
and you just want to have some sort of

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,580
educational fun I've seen all kinds of

00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:26,860
ridiculous things that people do with

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,690
these like they build like a burglar

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,370
detector and stuff like that sort of

00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:33,179
like when the door opens a little sign

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:36,460
pops up and says you're busted or like

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,530
one person used it in their safe and put

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,240
how-to module for light detection so

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,179
that when the safe opens it just like

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,650
blares this really annoying sound so

00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:47,049
there are some interesting things you

00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,870
can do with it I'm still not sold on the

00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:52,210
educational value but it's fun

00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,240
so Raspberry Pi we have one of these and

00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,280
he loves it because he can just touch it

00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,140
and nothing there's no moving parts in

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,299
it so unless it's plugged in and doing

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,090
something ridiculously hard it doesn't

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:06,940
even burn you when you touch it they're

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,770
cheap you can you can get the PI zero I

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,010
wouldn't recommend the PI zero for

00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,720
younger kids they're more especially my

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:17,020
youngest kid would be more likely to put

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,429
it in his mouth and try and use it it's

00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,960
kind of the evolution for the circuit

00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:22,120
boards because you can get like a

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,039
breadboard for it and once he gets the

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,309
idea of like pluses and minuses you can

00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:28,720
do things like I walked him through

00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,370
obviously I did it but he was really

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,030
interested in it we I have a breadboard

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,710
for mine I plugged in like two things

00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,330
there I had a little sensor that was

00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,370
like eight dollars and it just it's a

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,230
sonic sensor so it sends out sounds and

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,789
get gets it back to figure out how far

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,590
something is and I wrote a little

00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,929
program that says if something's within

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,460
eight feet turn on the webcam and and he

00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,900
really loved that like we pretended it

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,120
was like a doorbell or something and

00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,860
just kind of put I put a tape on the

00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,650
door and then the outside door obviously

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,419
we took it down cuz webcams aren't all

00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,590
all-weather and I live in Canada but we

00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:01,210
just put it up there and he's like oh

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,030
that's really neat like it turns on and

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,890
I can see it so he kind of gets a taste

00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,530
for using circuit boards and he's

00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:10,600
already done the snap circuits there are

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,510
so many things you can do with the

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,080
Raspberry Pi so many things I'm not even

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:18,130
attempt

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,230
ah my adult friends love to pair this

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,179
with the Arduino so I have a friend who

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:25,600
has automated his beer production at

00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:28,870
home yes that's a thing I there's

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,399
another red hatter who he is a coffee of

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,960
fester natto however you say that word

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,470
and he uses this to cook the coffee

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,380
beans

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,720
he's like hacked his his little it's not

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,210
a microwave it's the it's kind of like

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,250
the mini oven whatever they're called

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,549
and so somehow he's got that hooked up

00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,389
to the Arduino so the Arduino is a

00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:52,029
purpose based thing to deal with

00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:54,909
hardware like its job is to talk to

00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,500
other hardware and so he programs the

00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,809
Raspberry Pi to talk to the Arduino and

00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,820
the Arduino is flipped flips bits on and

00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:02,350
off to turn things on and off and you

00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,179
can do lots of really interesting things

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:10,089
with it and most of the things if you if

00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:11,950
you type so if you used if you searched

00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,450
like three years ago you get completely

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:15,010
different results like if you said what

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,330
can I do interesting things with the

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,700
Raspberry Pi three years ago you've got

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,440
actually good stuff today you get like

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,599
the same nine things it's like you can

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,859
run Minecraft and like all of these

00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,690
sorts of things that you just basically

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:28,450
do on a regular computer like this is

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:32,139
not a project this is just me doing an

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:33,399
app to install something but it does

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,899
mean that if you want to give them

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,760
access to a computer and you have a

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,460
monitor bolted to the wall or something

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,220
like that you can well I say that

00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,419
because my youngest will pull just be

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,990
like I just want to take this with me

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:50,260
and like try and walk out with it he's

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,550
been walking since 6 months he just he

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,800
just got up and walked one day he just

00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,330
now he just pulled volts out of his crib

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,550
so nothing is safe from this kid

00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,410
everything is up like and but

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:01,720
significantly up because he's learned -

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,920
we have a like a two step ladder and

00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,810
he's learned to go in the kitchen and

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,869
pull this stupid thing out and just get

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,700
what he wants so we've got like I have

00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,020
monitor arms that are bolted to the wall

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,750
and stuff like that just so that he

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,730
doesn't get it but yeah so if you have

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,859
if you're comfortable giving your kids

00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,460
access to things raspberry pies great

00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:22,569
just because they can bang away on it

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,330
this is the book that I mentioned

00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:26,890
earlier it has one specific project in

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,060
it that I really like and the rest of

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,760
the

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,220
just like it's it's building your own

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,670
interactive map of your nap of your

00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,990
neighborhood and it's really neat little

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,390
kids need help with this this is

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,790
something like 10 12 14 years old that's

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,450
good with but it's really neat for them

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,310
to be able to see how how this works you

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,900
can put like points on the map and you

00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,770
can move around your neighborhood and

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,610
it's really neat to watch them explore

00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,610
this sort of stuff

00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:01,440
it used to be 25 I imagine it's still

00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,210
somewhere in the same price range

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:13,610
because books don't drop that much but

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:16,260
it's not that expensive yeah exactly

00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:20,730
it I didn't say this but you might be

00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,890
able to find this online somewhere so

00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,800
this is the Raspberry Pi with music

00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,090
lights I wanted to show you the clip but

00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,190
then I couldn't do it justice because

00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,360
it's like 7 minutes long and I didn't

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,890
want to speed it up because that'd ruin

00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,080
things and I didn't want to cut it down

00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,030
so I just wanted to mention like if you

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,440
for example go on YouTube you can find

00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,420
the guy that's doing I also have it in

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,860
the sources and I have the source video

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,360
if anybody just like wants me to give it

00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,620
to you on a flash drive to look it or I

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,530
can show it like I can play it

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,790
afterwards but it's really neat he just

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,140
like walks through like plugging all

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,790
this stuff in and then he goes outside

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,590
the videotapes his house and you can

00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,690
hear the music blaring inside the house

00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:57,410
and them the Christmas lights dancing

00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,410
along too it's neat

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:04,530
so mine tester minecraft so we like I

00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:08,460
like my desk because it's free it's open

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,270
source and he doesn't really need to

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,880
know the difference

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,160
this one is another one where you'll see

00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,320
a lot of people like really pushing

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,080
minecraft as an educational tool I'm not

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,120
sold on that what so what I chose to do

00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,480
is show you right here so this is like a

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,070
crafting book and what happens here is

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
all of these things you can click on and

00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,630
it shows you a recipe and you sometimes

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,760
you have to go three deep like like this

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,560
thing right here is developing plutonium

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,840
so like you're gonna you click on that

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,300
and it'll it'll say like you need to

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,539
have unenriched plutonium so how do I

00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,699
get that like and you have

00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,319
walk all the way back so it was actually

00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:46,419
really neat to watch my son work through

00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:47,199
the logic of this like being able to

00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:49,719
figure out

00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,099
I need this component part but to get

00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,799
this component part I need the thing

00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:56,439
before it and like it was good in that

00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:57,999
regard but I don't understand why

00:37:56,439 --> 00:38:00,400
everybody says that this is such a great

00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:01,929
educational game I haven't quite figured

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,489
that out yet so that's why we're in the

00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:09,339
things to consider phase this is 7

00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:12,160
billion humans this is the evolution to

00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:14,559
human resource machines it was updated

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,479
to not beyond assembly and now you have

00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:26,919
to control multiple guys at the same

00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:28,479
time the object of this since it's fed

00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:31,539
through it is it wants you to make a

00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:34,539
diagonal line difference so what's

00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,919
happening here is you're telling him to

00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:39,429
pick up the box that's in front of them

00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:40,940
and then I'm gonna drop down a thing

00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:42,590
that says

00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,360
right up here you can't see it but

00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,950
there's a little white bar that says if

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:51,860
there's something diagonal and that

00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:56,240
diagonal thing is another boss a

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,570
diagonal on line so right here is a grid

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,630
and it's a it's a 3x3 grid and then you

00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,800
can do equal to not equal to a whole

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,220
bunch of different different stuff like

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,100
that and then in this case it's a box so

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,650
I could have put like if the bottom

00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,540
corner is equal to an empty space and

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,240
that would have been equivalent but I

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,940
just chose to do it this way and then

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,370
you've got the same thing like jump and

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,990
there are other levels where you have to

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,670
control them separately because there

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,160
are holes and so you have to tell this

00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:30,080
guy like this guy has to have you know

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,840
make a Zed like this and this guy makes

00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,670
a C because he has to walk around so

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,740
this gets really complicated and it's

00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:39,260
more based on I think it's based on C++

00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:42,110
or something like that something to

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:47,090
consider much harder than than the

00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:48,950
original and that's pretty much it again

00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:50,030
this was just supposed to be like hey

00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,370
this is these are the things we've

00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:56,230
explored and what we think so we have

00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:58,400
you know this is the the guy who did the

00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:59,630
the little bits demonstration because

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,800
obviously that wasn't me there's a

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:06,470
Raspberry Pi Christmas lights and so on

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,980
so with that that's the end of my talk

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:21,250
and Wow too bad I was expecting like a

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:21,250
half hour yeah yes I forgot about that

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:50,600
yep there's a ton yep we restricted a

00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:54,620
lot like a lot a lot so while we use

00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:56,840
these to engage our kids Mateo is

00:40:54,620 --> 00:41:00,350
currently on an indefinite hiatus from

00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:02,360
video games because we have found that

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,040
his behavior just slides even after a

00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:08,060
half hour video games it is night and

00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,700
day how well he behaves so we give it to

00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,530
him sparingly it really depends on what

00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,720
he's attempt like what we need him to do

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,880
is like some of this stuff it's a little

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,430
harder to do with traditional you know

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,620
book learning type thing so we'll give

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,150
him the tablet but it's more like we set

00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,680
an egg timer and when the egg timer goes

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:27,740
off if he hasn't shut the screen off he

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:34,850
loses it so yeah we're very gentle with

00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:37,280
the screen time yes it's not something

00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,630
that I've used I it was something I came

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,820
across when I was reading about but

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:51,550
because I have no experience with it

00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:51,550
didn't make it in here a little bit

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:07,260
good example that's good to know yeah

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,920
yes

00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,039
so that's a good question no we don't we

00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,549
don't really direct him at all

00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:29,670
he really likes cars and so he watches

00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:31,259
so we also really really curtail YouTube

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,569
don't let your kids watch YouTube

00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:35,869
uncensored it like unattended it is

00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:39,359
especially the autoplay is terrible

00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:42,539
there's a TED talk on this but basically

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,059
within seven autoplays you get from a

00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:48,269
Peppa Pig video to Mickey Mouse

00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,309
masturbating and and it is ridiculous

00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:52,559
even when you have like the stuff so to

00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:55,259
answer your question he likes the RC

00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,299
cars and they do like it's geared at

00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:59,190
other adults so they do they like they

00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,480
flip over the car and they say oh it's

00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,130
got this kind of horsepower and like

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,960
they talk like that and so that's what

00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,190
he imitates he imitates the adults who

00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,569
were talking to other adults because

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:14,670
they're showing off they want to show

00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:20,700
Hoss and their RC car is yep what's that

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:25,019
Oh YouTube kids yeah no that's the same

00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:27,329
thing because the the issue YouTube kids

00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,130
removes the ads that's that's the whole

00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:31,529
purpose of it but it doesn't change the

00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:34,500
play algorithm that happens behind the

00:43:31,529 --> 00:43:36,480
scenes that that chooses so what what

00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,220
the algorithm is doing is saying like oh

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,509
the person like this and then they'll

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,369
play the next video all if they like

00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:43,079
this then this person is also and it

00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,210
walks down that kind of chain of

00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,750
Association and that algorithm doesn't

00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:51,599
change with YouTube kids YouTube in

00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:55,259
general is a terrible terrible thing for

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:58,019
kids because the kids videos are

00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:59,279
actually designed to trigger dopamine

00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,559
and your kids and their brains are not

00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:03,480
ready for it so it causes an addiction

00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,859
in your kids and like this I have

00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,630
sources for this I wasn't prepared to

00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,700
talk about this but when we looked into

00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,099
we found like a lot of psychologists

00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:13,170
talking about this stuff YouTube is

00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,539
really bad for the for the development

00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:16,259
of brain of the kids brains it's

00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,549
terrible

00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:20,400
they they go through withdrawal

00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:23,130
addictions if they can't watch YouTube

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,200
it is crazy and and the people who have

00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:28,289
figured this out have like there's a

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,259
YouTube channel that all the guy does is

00:44:28,289 --> 00:44:32,250
open so stupid Kinder Surprise eggs he's

00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:34,830
got

00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,050
billion views on his channel and that's

00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,180
all he does but he's figured out like

00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:44,210
how to make it so the kids just like

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,210
drool over him opening these stupid eggs

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:59,490
yeah you know what I don't know the

00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,680
answer to that question it's a good

00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,380
question though

00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,390
so we have a couple of stores up in

00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,850
Canada called like masterminds and a few

00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,220
others where their educational stores

00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,680
geared for kids and you can just go they

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,850
love kids and they breathe honest to god

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,160
they love kids it's amazing

00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,240
you walk in there and Mateo will pick up

00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,710
a box they're like oh do you want to see

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,450
and they rip the box open and they like

00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,760
do it with him and like they're they're

00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,870
fantastic so when we're looking at these

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:31,260
kind of things we go to like a

00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:34,080
mastermind because of that I have no

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,110
idea I'm sorry I don't I don't really

00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,550
know but they're fantastic if you have

00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:45,780
something similar I definitely recommend

00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:47,250
it that's a good question I do not know

00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,020
I have submitted the slides to them

00:45:47,250 --> 00:46:02,250
whether what they do with them do you

00:45:49,020 --> 00:46:03,750
know yeah so it's Linux Android and as

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,210
raspberry-pi so when I'm talking about

00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:09,560
the mobile apps I don't know anything

00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,560
about what happens in the iOS world

00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:25,210
no pressure

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:32,890
anything else ya know

00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:51,949
yeah so I handled that in two ways

00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:54,869
I have piehole running at home which is

00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:57,029
yeah okay so that seems to work

00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:59,549
predominantly so I have I do later

00:46:57,029 --> 00:47:02,130
approach I have I have piehole

00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:03,239
I have the pfSense blocking I can't

00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,799
remember what it's called but it has a

00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:07,859
plugin that does something similar I use

00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:10,109
you block origin and I use the FF

00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:12,239
plug-in privacy badger and between those

00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:14,099
it catches most of it and if I'm really

00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,390
concerned I use youtube-dl to actually

00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:19,410
download the videos and I put them on

00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:21,329
our plex server yeah

00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,489
Plex has been fantastic for curating

00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:24,839
videos like when I find something I he

00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:26,880
just watches over and over again and

00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,619
we've approved it we will download and

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:37,890
put it on Plex

00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:41,749
call it day well good questions I will

00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:41,749
