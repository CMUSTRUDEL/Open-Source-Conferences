Title: OLF 2018 Keynote - Containers will not Fix your Broken Culture
Publication date: 2018-10-21

Description: 
	Containers will not fix your broken culture. Microservices won’t prevent your two-pizza teams from needing to have conversations with one another over that pizza. No amount of industrial-strength job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway’s Law.

While the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops, we can’t buy it. We have to live it; continuous improvement is a choice we make every day, through our actions of listening empathetically and acting compassionately. Tools are essential, but how we use the tools and grow the culture and practices in our organizations needs even more attention.

Whether you’re just starting to implement technical and organizational change, or facing the prospect that you already have legacy microservices, it’s worth considering the why and the how of our behaviors, not just the what. (Spoiler alert: tech, like soylent green, is made of people.)
