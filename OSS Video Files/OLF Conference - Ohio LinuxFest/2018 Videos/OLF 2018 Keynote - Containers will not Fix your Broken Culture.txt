Title: OLF 2018 Keynote - Containers will not Fix your Broken Culture
Publication date: 2018-10-21
Playlist: 2018 Videos
Description: 
	Containers will not fix your broken culture. Microservices won’t prevent your two-pizza teams from needing to have conversations with one another over that pizza. No amount of industrial-strength job scheduling makes your organization immune to Conway’s Law.

While the unscrupulous might try to sell us devops, we can’t buy it. We have to live it; continuous improvement is a choice we make every day, through our actions of listening empathetically and acting compassionately. Tools are essential, but how we use the tools and grow the culture and practices in our organizations needs even more attention.

Whether you’re just starting to implement technical and organizational change, or facing the prospect that you already have legacy microservices, it’s worth considering the why and the how of our behaviors, not just the what. (Spoiler alert: tech, like soylent green, is made of people.)

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,799
today we're gonna talk a little bit

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,790
about how we are all I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,190
go out on a limb here and assume

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,019
everyone in terms of technologists we're

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,299
all technologists we're pretty sure we

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,910
can solve most problems with the

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,350
application of you know some C groups

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,939
and namespaces that solves all problems

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,150
in life right yeah

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,130
so problem is we get really excited

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,510
about technologies that we are pretty

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,119
sure are gonna solve a lot of the

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,189
problems we have spoiler alert

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,090
does not always go that way we're gonna

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,649
talk about it okay so the gotta have the

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,450
obligatory second slide which also

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,149
services my test pattern it's very nice

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,969
to see if things are getting you know

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,680
overscan truncated etc as Warner

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,719
mentioned I worked for Microsoft I've

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,379
worked there on the cloud developer

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,879
advocacy team for about a year and fun

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,100
fact I still don't have a Windows box

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,340
because I was like when I interviewed I

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,859
said hmm okay yes the stuff you're doing

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,049
with Asher seems pretty cool Windows is

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,790
a deal breaker and they said oh no it's

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,299
time we'll give you a Mac I'm like all

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,619
right cool

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,200
so that's a more on that later I live in

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,960
Minneapolis and I podcast with the rest

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,790
of DevOps and I am in fact the chief

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,070
cook and bottle washer of the you know

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,939
mysterious cabal that helps bring you

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,310
DevOps days the one in Columbus was last

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,350
month but they are probably planning to

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,320
do another one next year I'm assuming is

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,360
that right Warner yes and if you have

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,280
traveled here from a different city and

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,689
it was an inconvenient amount of time

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
and you would love to run a DevOps days

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,119
in your own city I think we're in about

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,399
70 cities on six continents in 2018 so

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,350
you could perhaps around a 2019 one

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,240
especially if you happen to work at

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,530
McMurdo Station because it would be

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,570
really nice to get that seventh

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,640
continent all right so I usually like

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,049
literally for Microsoft my job is to go

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,939
around giving people free open-source

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,829
kubernetes workshops so like that's what

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm usually talking about I'm not really

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,670
gonna be talking about kubernetes today

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,619
I will say that if that sounds exciting

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,050
to you and you too would like the you

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,150
know former evil empire to pay you to be

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,240
a member of the Rebel Alliance like cool

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,490
we're hiring

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,630
please you know so that is something to

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,530
consider right there but enough on that

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,500
first I'm going to tell you a lie

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,890
because I feel like a lot of times

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,780
people tell you that computers are the

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,450
easy part and you know dealing with

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,760
people is hard and you're like right and

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,440
so like your if your I've used this

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,390
slide a number of times you've probably

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,340
if you've gone to my website have a

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,840
Google unique name in the 70s my parents

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,520
very conveniently gave me a Google

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,400
unique name so you can see that spoilers

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,830
yeah as it turns out we're creating

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,990
systems that are significantly more

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,170
complex than anything we've created

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,610
before they start to have the fractal

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,970
complexity found in nature which means

00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:06,550
that yeah it is actually hard for us to

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,090
create and operate and maintain and

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,650
change these systems and the human

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,300
factors those people that you kind of

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,280
shake your tiny fist at in your head are

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,670
actually part of these complex systems

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,130
and so we kind of do have to think about

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,230
that human factor because otherwise it's

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,010
really hard to construct and operate

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,620
these complex systems at scale and I

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,180
feel like every conference talk

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,890
especially with somebody who you know

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,200
appears to be from Microsoft and

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,140
whatever needs a little bit of bonafides

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,610
I got a CS degree in the 90s looking

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,870
back I think it's clear that it was

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,210
mostly because I didn't want to talk to

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,130
people spoiler alert

00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,330
Tech is actually all about talking to

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:52,210
people but I I look back and I still

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,280
have these textbooks and that that bored

00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,600
us from the convex sea one that our HTM

00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,030
student off his head when we just

00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,500
assembled it I took it home I also have

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,820
the front panel you can see it sometimes

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,250
in the back background of one of my

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,290
podcasts but I pulled these books out

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,440
when I wanted to kind of make a I wanted

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,930
to illustrate a point which is it's easy

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,610
for us to say if we've been doing this a

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,310
while I'm looking around the room some

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,020
of you were around my age some of you

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,030
might have been on call for y2k I was on

00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,710
call for y2k the worst thing that

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,090
happened was my pager was really heavy

00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,130
and broke the strap on my party dress

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,510
but that's not because it was

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,790
 it's because we all worked

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,280
really hard to make it not a problem

00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,070
and I think that it's it's important for

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,480
us to look back and realize that a we

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,520
have been doing this stuff a while we

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,470
are getting pretty good at it but be a

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,150
lot of people are coming along who maybe

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,560
they're like I think I talked to

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,430
somebody at the party last night who was

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,310
like yeah y2k I was 10 I'm like oh dear

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,170
but if you think about it like every

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,990
single person coming along attack has

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,240
their own valid excellent different

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,010
perspective than yours and I think it's

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,050
really easier for us when we start

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,580
talking about demographic tick boxes to

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,440
assume but that's just so that like

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,270
people feel good and included and loved

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,920
and hugged or whatever but like actually

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,990
it's really valuable that we have people

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,850
who are maybe helping us operate systems

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,640
and have come out of the nodejs world or

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,560
whatever and I'm like I I'm I don't have

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,330
any jeans skinny enough to operate

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,890
nodejs I think that's what a boss of

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,280
mine one side and I was like yeah pretty

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,550
much

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,760
but it is also really valuable right to

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:28,480
consider that people who might have to

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,400
think a lot about what NPM and left Pat

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,160
are doing to their lives it's good to

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,020
have their perspective right even if we

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,640
are not coming from the exact same place

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,650
we're all working on this stuff together

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,690
and I think that we also have a lot of

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,520
cliches and patterns and maybe anti

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,190
patterns in tech this is not

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,410
photoshopped I took this picture in

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,430
Minneapolis they have I think sense move

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,860
some of those kind of shipping

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,360
containers but there is a great deal of

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:02,140
you know cloud and containers and it's

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,240
um greenfield they're possibly the right

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,460
and probably the the slow-burning tire

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,570
fire is probably your kubernetes cluster

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,650
yeah you bet I gotta tell you people

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,890
have a lot of problems running this

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,510
stuff in production right and this is

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,580
this is by the way quick kubernetes

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,100
sidebar if you actually want to run it

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,990
in production you probably should buy at

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,730
least consider start by looking at your

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,250
cloud provider of choice and seeing what

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,630
they have that takes away some of the

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,660
complexity for you it won't take away

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:36,400
all of it but okay but anyway I feel

00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,350
like we can get hung up on the

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,170
and I think it's really important for us

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,540
to look at some of the things in our

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,240
social structures that also influence

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,700
how things go like first things first

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,890
I love check I'm a nerd I still edit

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,750
everything in VI my co-workers tell me V

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,920
s code is really great and I'm like but

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm VI but tack itself is not gonna

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,990
solve absolutely everything that we're

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,860
trying to do unfortunately we can we can

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:09,010
probably look at noted technology

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,370
thought leader Jane Austen when she did

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,680
say in fact she wrote that anyone with

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,970
any containers as in want of a container

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,630
platform of something along those lines

00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,720
and I would say that even if this is

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,450
this is from a diagram from a it was

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,580
like a magazine in the 1890s and they

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,960
were working on predicting the 1990s

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,880
they're working on predicting a hundred

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,150
years in the future what I think is

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,180
really interesting about it is sartorial

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,310
challenges aside they're not wrong like

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,290
hey look they were predicting our you

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,880
know our video calls where the sound

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,860
doesn't work like this this is

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,620
definitely the sort of thing that was

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,000
expected right and I feel like every

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,070
time we're trying to create technology

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,050
solutions we're trying to imagine a

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,330
future where we're kind of imagining it

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,370
like that like you know what the rough

00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,840
outline is probably right and some of

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,540
the other stuff is going to be really

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,370
really wrong and that is okay like we're

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,580
not magic we're not actually expected to

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,260
produce rather we produce the future we

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,460
aren't expected to predict it perfectly

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,470
because it's gonna be an iterative

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,600
process but I think we have to really

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,820
watch out for assuming that technology

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,950
will solve all of these problems right

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,840
and there's a this wall of confusion

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,820
that the classic wall of confusion that

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,050
Andrew clay Schafer who I worked worked

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,150
for a couple years and still talked to

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,850
all the time put this wall a confusion

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,229
idea out there this divide between like

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,060
say your development team and your

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,610
operations team I don't think it's

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,370
exactly right I usually remix it to be

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,840
something like this because it's all

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,240
about how the incentives are set up

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,280
inside your organization right so you

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,889
can have great technology and you could

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,509
have a release to celebrate your new

00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,129
that went really well and you can have

00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:54,369
some people in the operations team who

00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:55,720
probably have a fire that's not even

00:08:54,369 --> 00:09:00,879
slow burning on their hands because

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,410
turns out if one team is incentivized by

00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,509
getting that release out quickly and

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,339
another team is incentivized by keeping

00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:09,100
everything really stable those

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,290
incentives are the problem like you

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,790
don't have to have bad cross team

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,859
collaboration but if you're

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,279
incentivizing people at cross-purposes

00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:20,350
this is that human thing that the

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,169
technology itself isn't going to change

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,629
inside our organization there is another

00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:27,489
and yet I got to tell you what there's

00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,809
also like dev and ops and people are

00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:31,209
like those teams don't get along let's

00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:33,339
get an ill-conceived a DevOps silo and

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,809
like they'll use some C groups and

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,579
namespaces and that'll make the dubs and

00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,899
the ops get a lot it's like mmm but we

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,419
all know that doesn't actually work

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:42,699
probably cuz we've tried it there's also

00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,309
and I think it's it's fair to point out

00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:47,949
do we have any security people in the

00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,569
house yeah we definitely do so you may

00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:52,629
have seen this picture that peach has

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:56,379
Locke used at dev ops days in Austin and

00:09:52,629 --> 00:10:00,189
in 2015 and what I appreciate about this

00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:03,089
is like we again as humans we like to

00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:05,619
make things simple and boolean and like

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,379
maybe our numbers that way but like

00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:10,839
we're not you know we're not able to say

00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:13,480
like we'll have DevOps and magic and

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,759
rainbows and security it's like oh like

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,549
this is we have to all work together

00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,829
across teams so I think that's the the

00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:23,889
TLDR they're like you're not going to

00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:25,480
have you know DevOps magic where you get

00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,819
certified for it and then you're done

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,100
like that that's not actually real and

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,809
I'm all for everyone trying to have good

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,089
cross team collaboration and good

00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,980
technology but like it's I think it's

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,079
really easy for somebody to say oh we

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,879
did our DevOps initiative in q3 last

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,429
year so we're very DevOps now and it's

00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,109
like I think that the unicorn and

00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:47,410
Rainbow and security people have

00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:50,019
something to say about that so it's I

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,319
think it's it's valuable just to think

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,179
about for example a lot one place where

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,970
a lot of that tension comes in between

00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,640
teams is when you've shipped something

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,970
and you have the fun question of

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,250
does it work is it working is everything

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,230
is all of the end-user data getting

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,270
horribly and or you know irrevocably

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,640
corrupted right now by this canary of

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,650
the new release like if you don't have

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,020
tooling built to answer that question

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,810
you're gonna be a lot twitchy er about

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,490
deploying anything right and so while

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,190
tools are not going to solve this

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,410
problem we can use tools to reduce a lot

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,660
of that stress between our you know in

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,700
our organizations if we can actually

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,440
answer questions about what's happening

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,390
inside our systems and if you're

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,250
thinking like but that's so obvious

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,330
Bridget like oh how sweet you've never

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,650
been on call ok cool but I invite you to

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,990
be on call for production and then

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,990
figure out whether or not you can answer

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,660
those questions about your system and

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,840
it's a this again it's like conflict

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,000
from misaligned incentives Andrew cliff

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,980
Schafer actually says that any rutting

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
system is in a state of continuous

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,660
partial failure at all times like that's

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,880
true and I think that you can have

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,060
continuous partial failure and not have

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,400
like a complete disaster does anyone

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,750
know what this ship is just I was like

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,970
to pull and see if anyone is actually

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,060
familiar with us cool cool

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:19,050
all right tell you a quick story it was

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,060
the 17th century and Sweden decided to

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,270
go to war with Denmark as one does and

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,700
the wily King of Denmark had like giant

00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,560
new fancy ships and so Sweden decided

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,170
that they too needed to deploy of giant

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,990
new fancy warships and this would have

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,490
gone well maybe except that there was

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,140
scope creep and a lack of documentation

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,840
and the shipwright died during

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,870
construction and they didn't have all

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,970
the right parts and the king was like

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,620
yolo ship anyway and so what they end up

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,660
shipping they ended up shipping a ship

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,030
with two gun decks which was an

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,860
interview no scope creep and innovation

00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,580
that had never actually been deployed by

00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,810
the Swedish Navy before and it didn't go

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,180
super well after less than one mile it

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,680
heeled over and sank and then they

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,810
pulled it up in the 20th century and

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,240
it's a really well preserved really

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,750
fascinating ship and one of the problems

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,730
with it is that it was top-heavy which

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,230
essentially why it sank and it was

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,270
top-heavy because there were all of

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,390
these carved wooden figures to like

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,160
strike fear into the hearts of the Danes

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:26,900
it's like we've all worked on that

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,150
project and peach has locked us a really

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,630
great talk about this that you can you

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,460
can go go watch a video of 17th century

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,930
shipbuilding and your failed software

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,760
project because it's excellent I can't

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:42,170
do it justice but I bring it up because

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,740
if you think about it it's great if you

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,510
have ideas super but you actually have

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,910
to implement them and they actually have

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,680
to work and hopefully not sink to the

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,560
bottom of the harbor and I think that

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,720
that's one of the places where it's so

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,180
important for us to have free

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,860
open-source software because otherwise

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,410
what you end up with is the ship raid

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,570
dies and you have like ah no idea what

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,070
they tried to implement and it's like

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,360
hmm it would be better if they were

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,760
using something that wasn't there

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,440
artisanal bespoke hand whittled platform

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,270
I mean I built one of those well built

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,300
one of those right like ours was built

00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,770
out of docker packer chef AWS and like a

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,390
bunch of janky bash because if people

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,220
tell you that there's no janky bash

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,650
underlying the homegrown platform they

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,250
are lying there is definitely janky bash

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,410
in there but like we've all build stuff

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,970
like that we've all regretted it we've

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,410
all been on a slack later with our

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,540
former co-workers who are still trying

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,760
to get it working and like this is kind

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,100
of again one of those places where this

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,660
is human factors it's not something that

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,390
we solve no matter how great the

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,130
technology is also I love bash and I

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,730
write it as a tool of choice for pretty

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:53,000
much everything but okay so we all agree

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:57,770
that tech itself is not going to save us

00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,470
or the vasa sadly but there's also like

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:03,320
that question of the interactions inside

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,030
our team and I think it's it's really

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,020
important for us to try to build

00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:10,250
distributed systems that are complex

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,750
distributed systems with the

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,280
understanding that people aren't going

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,589
to be part of this people are going to

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:20,660
operate it they're they're going to have

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:24,230
opinions about like exactly what is what

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,649
kind of state do we have can we document

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,660
or even

00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:30,930
we fully comprehend all of it ourselves

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,569
like if if our systems become so complex

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,600
that one or two people can't even really

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,339
hold the mental map of them in our heads

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,170
you have problems I've talked to people

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,559
who work at other large cloud providers

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,660
who have gotten that second systems yeah

00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:47,189
say that three times fast second system

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,019
syndrome where they're trying to build

00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:51,360
up a second thing to replace the very

00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,329
important old thing that no one really

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,860
understands anymore and it's like yeah

00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:57,629
you probably should have started

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,179
building that second thing earlier and

00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:01,679
also those people who did understand it

00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,929
would have been much happier if they

00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,939
could have distributed some of that load

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,439
and some of that knowledge before they

00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,209
became a giant single point of failure

00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:12,869
in the system in the complex system that

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:16,350
they built and this is again like I

00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:18,809
would say when people say like oh well

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,149
you know we'll we'll fix this by having

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,610
small teams and it's like that's cool

00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,619
it's fine for you to have you know two

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,999
pizza teams I mean I have many questions

00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,769
about how hungry these people are and

00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,029
like how large the pieces are but okay

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,519
well we'll give you that you can have a

00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:34,170
two piece of team but at some point that

00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,759
team probably has to intersect with

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,980
something else in your organization

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,749
maybe security or maybe like you know

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:46,279
purchasing I'm like there's there's a

00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:48,149
lot of parts we're just having small

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,769
theoretically independent

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,269
cross-functional tea or you know

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,029
cross-functional teams doesn't

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:57,120
necessarily solve anything if you can't

00:16:54,029 --> 00:17:01,139
expand the communication beyond that so

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,819
I would say then people say okay well we

00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,589
will definitely solve this with micro

00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:08,640
services because they solve everything

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:11,329
right and like yes they will definitely

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,360
help you solve some of your problems

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:17,039
however my my boss at dramafever Tim

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,130
Gross likes to call it conservation of

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,720
complexity like you're still going to

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,640
have complexity you're just gonna put it

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,899
somewhere else and that might be fine

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,159
and that might be a trade after you want

00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:31,200
to make and that might be exactly what

00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:33,840
you want but if you if you move your IP

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,639
see into network timeouts you haven't

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,799
actually made it go away like you've

00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,190
you've just changed where your problem

00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,130
is

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,160
and that's fine and it can be very

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,500
valuable but I always want to I have I

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,810
have played the the microservices game

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,520
I have lived that movie it doesn't

00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,810
actually solve all the problems you

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,200
think it solves it just moves them

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:57,180
around which again it might be fine and

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,820
I think that it's by the way did you

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,680
folks know Mel Conroy is actually still

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,180
alive and on Twitter which is like

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,120
amazing

00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,890
but Conway's law people look at that and

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,890
they think excellent so we're gonna roll

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,080
out a new system so we need to reorg

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,180
and I look at that and I think okay so

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,240
honestly I think the most important word

00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,350
in Conway's law and you know if you if

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,140
you can't read it on the screen it just

00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,730
says that this is a paraphrase of it but

00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,130
it just says that if you're designing a

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,170
system you're gonna get a design that

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,630
produces a copy of your organisation's

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,580
communication structure and people read

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,170
that as organization structure and I

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,120
think the most important word in

00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,460
Conway's law is actually communication

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,740
like you don't necessarily have to reorg

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,110
you have a new initiative as long as you

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,280
have good cross team communication so

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,590
that things don't get dropped on the

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,510
floor or there's not so much like blame

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,630
game stuff that takes up a lot of time

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,850
and is inefficient and not great and

00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:56,820
we've seen we've seen people say that

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,530
they've solved this because they only

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,150
communicate through api's and the teams

00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,750
don't actually talk to each other and so

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,980
therefore there can't be

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:07,020
misunderstandings and I was like so one

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,250
of the many problems with that is what

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,390
if you really need to deprecate

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:14,760
something okay I mean you better talk to

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,370
people like bring pizza right like this

00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,090
is this is not something that you solve

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,730
necessarily without good team

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:25,860
interactions so I think I hope that that

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,580
pizzas not made of Soylent Green

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,370
but our tech super is right cuz like

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,200
we're all in this room you know taking

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,820
our Saturday to talk about tuck with

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,460
each other because we're trying to solve

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:41,340
these problems I think it's important

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,350
for us to realize that there are many

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,780
technical solutions there are many

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,720
fenders there are many tools there

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,100
really isn't a right one we do have some

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,570
seats up front or like it will not

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,929
disturb me at all if people want to sit

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,759
down

00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,259
there are some seeds there's no sea

00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,539
world rules here the first three rows

00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:04,320
will not get wet so but like if we're if

00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:06,179
we're trying to you know solve our

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,639
technical problems I think it's really

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,139
tempting and I've seen this a lot of

00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:13,440
times and I've probably fallen into this

00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:15,450
myself is like we can build a really

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,159
complex Rube Goldberg machine that

00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,950
doesn't really need to be the way it is

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,929
but we totally wanted to use some no

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,340
sequel and doctor and kubernetes and

00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,869
whatever that we wanted to glue together

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,179
to make one of those what have you built

00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:32,669
means and I think that this is a problem

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,730
in an organization when the incentives

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,649
again are back to well what's what's the

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,419
best thing for my resume the best thing

00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,679
for my resume is definitely to build a

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,029
thing that no one's going to be able to

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,919
maintain and they're probably going to

00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:46,080
move away from as soon as I quit like

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,360
that that's just the reality that we run

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,029
into you and I think it's it's really

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,129
important for and I I'm really trying to

00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:56,100
get this idea to take hold in our

00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:58,200
industry is that you do not have to

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,360
innovate the totally greenfield thing to

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,830
add value like and this is from Laura

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,200
Bell from New Zealand and she's

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,539
fantastic and I really appreciate this

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,970
idea that like if you look at kind of a

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,279
Simon wordly idea of pioneer settlers

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,570
town planners like your pioneers is Dan

00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,730
she ate something and your settlers

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,159
scale it up your town planners make it

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,080
totally routine and boring and like I'm

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,519
on teen settler and like not just

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,190
because I'm totally wearing Settlers of

00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,860
Catan leggings though I am but I like

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,110
the idea of yeah it's cool to come in

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,139
when something has been proof of concept

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,330
instead of work but exists and then

00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:35,009
all right let's operationalize this like

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,690
let's make this so that people can I

00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,639
don't know actually count on it

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,019
that's kind of exciting but I think

00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:42,539
there's a lot of glamour intact around

00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,429
the new shiny it's like how about the

00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:49,409
old shiny that actually stays shiny and

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:52,710
works like that and I also think this is

00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:55,049
a Astrid Atkinson is a director at

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,299
Google and she likes to say she started

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:58,950
working at a little startup in 2004 and

00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:02,519
it's called Google and she still works

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,340
there and the what she points out is

00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,750
that

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,310
and this tweet is old this is from like

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,410
2013 that people get really attached to

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,720
the solution that they created and they

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,570
get really attached to their ideas and

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,570
they wrap their ego up in it and then

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,490
you're like but perhaps we should not

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,620
use a session store as our important

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,690
impermanent data store and people are

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,800
like no because that was something that

00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,840
they came up with and they're excited

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,330
about it I think that that's where we

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,700
have to again like just strictly

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,900
tactically even if you do not care about

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,000
what other people think cuz they're

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,320
wrong tactically you're going to get a

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,180
lot more results you want if you

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,470
understand why they are emotionally

00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,700
attached to their terrible terrible

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:48,550
ideas so that's a that's that's

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,030
basically like okay text made of people

00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,170
and we also at the same time you're

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,320
sitting there thinking so are you

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,180
telling me too that the intern should be

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,340
able to Yolo that questionable data

00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,100
store out into production like no I'm

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,970
definitely not saying that I'm saying

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,770
that we want to have good we want to

00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,260
have good constraints around what we're

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,960
choosing and I don't mean the terrible

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,610
wall of confusion and this is from the

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,940
polar vortex a couple years ago my

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:21,940
spouse is standing on Lake Superior but

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:26,080
this is a I think it's really important

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,270
for us to have the kind of constraints

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,020
inside our organizations that may be

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:36,100
just our warning signs that are maybe

00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:38,020
just hey we tried that this is what

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,630
happened is that a trade-off we're

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,190
willing to live with and again these are

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,870
these are conversations that we have to

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,210
have with other humans because there's

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,820
never gonna be a clear-cut easy answer

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,990
that is right right I mean you know that

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,090
there's there's not a right answer

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,380
there's just a bunch of less bad answers

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,970
that might not get you patient in the

00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,340
middle of the night and like that's how

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,940
you choose right and I think it's also

00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,050
it's valuable again to think about you

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,280
know I was talking about common ways a

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,900
lot earlier and I'll bring up cab

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,730
theorem too because we've got a hit but

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,340
like the bingo card I'm sure somebody

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:11,170
has a bingo card somewhere and what I

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,780
like to think about when I think about

00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:17,370
cap theorem is Katie McCaffrey

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,310
colleague of mine actually at Microsoft

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,350
she started about when I did last year

00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,450
likes to say that you don't get to

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,910
choose to not have partition like

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,650
because physics and math like you you

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,940
have to choose between consistency and

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,500
availability like those are your choices

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,970
you don't get to choose to not have

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,460
anything ever go wrong on your systems

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,640
and not just for partitions but just

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,490
like reaching beyond that I think that a

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,310
lot of systems that people create they

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:46,560
like to you know map out the happy path

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,780
and they're like this will be wonderful

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,840
and then those of us who are apps people

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,250
at heart are like unless they're like

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,250
why do you hate everything I'm like I

00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,570
just hate being awakened at night and I

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,180
think that it's this is one of those

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:01,440
places where it's actually I think it's

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,960
valuable for us to take some lessons

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,240
from the distributed systems world again

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,120
and apply them to our organizations like

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,670
for example you're going to get better

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,610
decisions if the people closest to the

00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,620
side-effects and bad effects have input

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,090
like if if you can push as much

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,980
decision-making to the edge as possible

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,330
instead of like central command and

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,440
control telling you to do things you

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,510
have the people who are actually on the

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,030
ground understanding it it's like hmm

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,280
the my brother is a retired Army Ranger

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,480
and like the US military figured this

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,130
out like they don't do the central

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,290
command and control thing anymore it's

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,910
like hmm maybe in tech we should stop

00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,390
trying to do that because a lot of

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:41,400
places still do and I think that there's

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,100
another like and that again this also

00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,630
has to do with our distributed

00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,370
organizations like no one wants to wait

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,870
for 10 hours for headquarters to wake up

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,180
to make a decision I think that's going

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:53,220
to ruin everything and yet some some

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,600
organizations still run that way or the

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,920
important decision-maker wasn't on the

00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,900
call I guess we're not going to decide

00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,900
it's like really was that a good use of

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,370
everyone's time I also think that like

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,920
in terms of the way we run our

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,950
communications it's super important

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,470
right to remember that people might not

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,650
be taking away from the meeting what you

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:17,010
thought that you put out there and if

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,170
you we don't build our important

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,570
computer systems with a bunch of UDP

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:23,040
like that would be ridiculous but think

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,350
about how many meetings that you've left

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,360
and you're super positive that something

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,510
was decided and someone else is super

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,799
positive that something

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,860
way different was decided you're like

00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,860
why did we not check some this like we

00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,020
can have sins and acts and our human

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,210
communications it's like really just

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,100
like send out the summary email well for

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,620
technologists we all know how to have

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,309
consistency in our communications like

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,840
we make TCP do this every day but we

00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:53,049
somehow managed to miss it in our

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,809
meetings a lot and instead I think that

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,640
we we try to make our key textural

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,400
decisions either based on the stickers

00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,650
in my old laptop or because and you know

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,179
the cat really likes the you know the

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,220
cat likes doctor the cat sitting right

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:09,700
there we make those kind of decisions

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:12,700
around what you know tribalism and

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,230
fashion might lead to you and we might

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,640
not be using Occam's razor and just

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,140
thinking the laptop is warm all right

00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,510
that's where the cuts sitting there it's

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,830
it's sometimes our answers are a lot

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:25,510
simpler than we think they are but we're

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,309
going to get better choices if we

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,260
empower the people who are the most

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,960
affected by the choices to choose

00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:37,929
instead of you know just picking the the

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:40,510
cutest stickers if we want to do what's

00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,790
right not just what's expedient I should

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,470
also point out that when the Cambridge

00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,809
analytical stuff came out I wasn't

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,429
surprised at all because I actually

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:52,030
built systems like that

00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:55,419
in 2012 when I worked at an ad tech

00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:57,520
startup that harvested people's friends

00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,890
likes and fed them into MapReduce jobs

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,830
and I was mostly focused on how fun you

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:05,530
know all the HBase and Hadoop stuff was

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,809
and I wasn't really focused on did these

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,820
people's friends really want their data

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,100
in there and I think that's something

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,049
that like we all fall into because that

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,000
produced in HBase like this is this is

00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,530
fun and this is interesting and we're

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
building stuff that we think is great

00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:23,169
and perhaps technically it is really

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,330
cool but I think it's incumbent upon us

00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:27,880
as technologists to look back and think

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,559
or to look at anything we're considering

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,919
doing and being like yeah we absolutely

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:35,559
can build this should we we're gonna

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,809
make the world worse if we build this I

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:38,980
think that's actually really important

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:40,570
and it's something that we don't talk

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,979
about enough and tack

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,639
that's something I would definitely

00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:47,379
point out because I got to tell you like

00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:49,239
we're definitely living in a different

00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:53,289
sci-fi reality than the one I thought we

00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:55,359
were gonna live in I wasn't expecting a

00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:58,659
press of cyberpunk dystopia to be the

00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,699
car that came up and it did and I think

00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:02,499
that that doesn't mean and I'm sure you

00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:04,209
all saw the news that the planet

00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:07,959
apparently has only 12 years left which

00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:09,969
what okay I will tell you that I the

00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:14,859
good news is I'm way less worried about

00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:17,679
the end of a pop time now but on the

00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:20,369
other hand we probably would prefer to

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,229
have you know air and water and and

00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:24,940
Wi-Fi like all of the essentials in the

00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:26,319
in the pirate of the pyramid of me it's

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,239
like we probably want to prefer to have

00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,969
that and so I think it is important for

00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:32,739
us to think as technologists about is

00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:35,379
the stuff that we're doing going to make

00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:36,729
the planet better or worse like that's

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,709
maybe not something that we all thought

00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:41,679
about when we started in technology but

00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:45,789
it matters now and I think it matters

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,989
because we don't want to make the world

00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:48,399
worse we don't want to make our

00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:50,109
co-workers less happy we don't want to

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:54,879
make our end-users less happy I mean

00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:57,489
obviously but I think they'd we focus so

00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:59,190
much on the technology and like I have

00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:01,929
news for you like you can't take a

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:04,419
shipping container with 800 units of

00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:06,429
DevOps in it and like just deliver that

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:09,549
and unpack it and everything is fine

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:12,639
like that doesn't actually work and we

00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:15,699
can't we especially in our organizations

00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:18,039
can't have 600 of those units of DevOps

00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:19,779
go to the favored few and then tell

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,429
other people you're running things in

00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:23,019
maintenance mode like do you really

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:25,269
think that they're gonna be ok with that

00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:27,489
are they going to get resentful and

00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:29,499
maybe not do as well or maybe just leave

00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:31,869
because we haven't considered what those

00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:34,539
humans need like no even if somebody is

00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:37,329
maintaining an important legacy system

00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,879
that doesn't mean that their ideas and

00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:41,469
their needs don't matter but that

00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,089
doesn't mean and I want to I want to be

00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:44,529
careful to not make it sound like I'm

00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:48,579
just saying everything has to be shiny

00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:50,829
and new all the time because Deming did

00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:53,079
it he he did it you can read about

00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:54,380
Deming he did a lot of like analysis

00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:57,169
around industrial process

00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,039
and he made the point that I think is

00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,240
quite salient that it doesn't mean that

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,390
we have to change everything all the

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,090
time it does mean that if we decide not

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:10,640
to change anything we are definitely

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,830
going to be the sad snowman and I can

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,419
offer myself up as evidence like I was

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:17,059
pretty darn good at running those Sun of

00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:18,410
us for when three boxes and you know

00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,150
poor went out on the cart and the curb

00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,679
for Sun I know full and four was real

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,559
but I feel like what four one three was

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,330
the ur Sun OS and I was good at it and

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,150
you know what that is not a valuable

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:31,610
skill anymore and that is okay and I can

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:34,940
actually do prefer nutty stuff now but

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:38,630
like long technology leap there but it's

00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:41,539
it was a but not as far as you would

00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:44,059
think because zones low and Solaris but

00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:46,429
uh I think it's it's really important

00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:48,710
for us to remember that we have to be

00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:52,850
open to learning from the people around

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:55,669
us because change is inevitable on the

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:58,250
other hand I don't want to denigrate

00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:00,530
anything that is but that legacy system

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,320
because I think a really good test for

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,000
whether that legacy system matters is if

00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,350
you say you're going to turn it off and

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,500
you see how many people like have a

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:11,000
heart attack and like if they're really

00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,669
upset about the idea of turning it off

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,830
it probably matters like that's probably

00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:18,830
where all the customer data is you know

00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,990
that's probably the that's probably the

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,909
legacy data store that no one really

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:26,450
wants to finish migrating but they super

00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:28,250
need so it's I think that is important

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:30,770
and you know who is running those legacy

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,840
data stores is you and me and everyone

00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,919
who everyone is calling us the boring

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,140
legacy thing and you're like you know

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,090
we're why you have paychecks okay just

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,460
so you know and that's why it's really

00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,870
important like not to and then this is

00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,480
back to the human factors how our

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,070
colleagues feel if people feel like the

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,440
stuff they're doing isn't being valued

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,240
they're not gonna do it as well and they

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,159
might leave and then you'll have really

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,510
terrifying legacy problems and the

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,750
person who understands them isn't there

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,340
anymore so I think that it is really

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,799
important and that that means we're all

00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,040
pulling together like this it totally

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,840
sounds like I'm just saying oh love it

00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,350
hearts and flowers and I'm like no it's

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
more like

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,070
you're on that ship and you really would

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,750
prefer it not sink and you're gonna all

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,950
pull on the ropes together and maybe

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,440
it's not the one that you're used to

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,270
working on but you're gonna learn you're

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,750
gonna help each other like I think that

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:23,480
that's really important so basically I

00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,039
would say in our technological systems

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,289
it's really important for us to

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,330
recognize that change is going to keep

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:32,030
coming just to study as the wave like it

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,580
is this tweet is from my colleague Eric

00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,799
st. Martin

00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:38,659
he worked at Disney and Comcast and a

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,789
bunch of places and he started gopher

00:33:38,659 --> 00:33:42,260
con with Brian kettle s'en they both

00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,720
actually work on the same team as me at

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,970
Microsoft now and I like that he points

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,140
out that kubernetes is not the end game

00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,270
he kind of does a halt and catch fire

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,429
reference here and says it's not the

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,860
thing it's the thing that gets us to the

00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:57,320
thing it just it gets us whatever the

00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,880
technology dish or is I always tell

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,110
people who are coming to a workshop and

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,030
trying to determine if they too should

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:06,169
be coopering some Nettie's and I'm like

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,789
look does it solve a problem you have if

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,200
it solves a problem you have that's

00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,600
super yeah you should definitely be

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,129
looking at this and if you look at all

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,330
the use cases and benefits you're like

00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:16,730
we don't really have those problems like

00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,590
okay that's cool it's not actually

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,970
mandatory for you to take everything on

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,179
the front page of hacker news and yellow

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,720
it out into production immediately like

00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:28,940
your permission from me to not do that

00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:32,060
but like there is going to be changed

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:35,149
though and it just keeps coming like the

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,740
change does not end the fact that you

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:38,929
know Jeffrey Stover the creator of

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:41,810
PowerShell pointed out like about a week

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:45,050
ago or so on Twitter that Asscher is

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:46,580
more than 50% Linux now it's like this I

00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,040
got to tell you I think I do think we

00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,720
live in the darkest timeline but I don't

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,970
think that everything in this timeline

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,580
is terrible and that is pretty cool I'll

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,920
take that I mean let's be perfectly

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,410
honest type mostly ran FreeBSD at home

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,100
until like 2015 when I was like I don't

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:06,920
have time I'm traveling too much but but

00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,650
Linux is super important and it's super

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,260
important to like some of the the

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,600
largest organizations in the world that

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,010
you might I already had several people

00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,630
including when I walked in yesterday

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,910
heckle me about like you know Microsoft

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,839
branding and I'm

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:25,059
like honestly look if you didn't see the

00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:27,789
news this week the fact that Microsoft

00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,109
just gave 60,000 patents to the open

00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:36,640
invention Network should say something

00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:38,799
it's late right like this is it's and

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,569
this is not just because I'm saying my

00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:41,770
employer did a good thing cool they've

00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:44,680
done a lot of things I don't agree with

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:47,650
- I'm really happy though that I think

00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,650
that the you know moral arc of the world

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:53,319
is moving towards more open it is moving

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,299
towards the kind of world that we would

00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,710
all like to live in the world we're

00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:59,319
trying to create and we've been trying

00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:02,500
to create for a long time and this is

00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,839
actually my pin tweet and it does kind

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,640
of seem like some sort of zany joke but

00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,530
like the reality is yeah I have a Mac

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,359
with a Microsoft asset tag on it and my

00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,849
job is to get people to use Linux on

00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,420
Azure and from this we can all conclude

00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:18,130
the 2018 is super weird but it's but

00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,859
it's also it's okay

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,390
like I want all of us I want us to all

00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:24,880
be challenged to go back to our

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:27,970
employers and go back to her or maybe

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,609
our customers and think about how can we

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,200
reach across barriers how can we break

00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:34,809
down those barriers how can we be more

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,250
open working with each other that's how

00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,349
we build a better world and I'm really

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,440
excited that everyone here is working on

00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:48,760
that so thanks

00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:48,760
[Applause]

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,839
thanks so much Bridget

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,839
