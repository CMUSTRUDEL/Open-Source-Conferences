Title: Ruth Suehle: Default to Open - Keynote, Ohio Linux Fest 2014
Publication date: 2014-11-04
Playlist: 2014 videos
Description: 
	One of the best talks we've ever seen at a Linux event, we asked Ruth if we could post this online to share with our community. We will update the description if we get a link to her talk.

With visions of Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, Thingiverse and Instructables, it looks on the surface to many that the maker community is also an open source community. But is it? What does "open source" mean beyond code, and how does it apply to the maker community? Is the maker community open by default (or should it be)? Take a trip back through the long history of making and short history of makers to see where open source fits in and where we should be headed.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
first of all I apologize for my voice

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,620
I've had a bit of a cold so that some

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,120
point you can't hear me just making

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,429
universal sign for I can't hear you

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,910
which i believe is this and I will

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,639
attempt to muster more sound as bad said

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,139
I work for red hat I joined about seven

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,029
years ago and initially worked on the

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,680
brand team for the last few years I've

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,689
been a part of a newer group called open

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,789
source and standards which is the part

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,470
of red hat that helps our upstream

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,820
communities that are so important to red

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,490
hot success we help them be successful

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,289
as well but of course all of that is

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,750
only tangentially related to baker so

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,790
like man said I co-authored a book on

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,800
Raspberry Pi and O'Reilly was nice

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,530
enough to send me I need 15 or 20 coffee

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,079
so after the second keynote if you would

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,840
like one and there are only 15 to 20 of

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,360
you who want one come see me over here

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,100
give you a copy I also write for open

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,230
source com as you mentioned not as much

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,940
as I used to someone from years ago if

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,070
you were here num number of years ago is

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,960
to give talks on open source com and

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,660
i've senior editor at a site called geek

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,340
mom where it's exactly what you think it

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,140
is I've talked about Star Trek than

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,970
dirty things and being a ball not

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,100
necessarily the same set but most

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,350
importantly as relates to this talk I'm

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,000
also a maker of thing I make lots of

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,979
things my first instinct when I see

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,009
something is how can i make that thing

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,320
not how can i buy that thing if i can so

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,210
it sculpt it frosted bakin Soder at

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,100
Kirsh a it ribbon hot glue it i'm

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,270
probably going to try to make it if i

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,650
don't already know how to do it i'm

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,210
going to figure it out and when i try to

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,470
find pictures to do a straight this i

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,100
realized that i believe

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,680
things that I can wear or eat I'm kind

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,330
of okay with that those of you who are

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,560
home brewers will recognize what happens

00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,700
when your yeast works really well it

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,020
turns out that is kind of like a cupcake

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,810
and I said my open source work wasn't

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,660
really related to makers and that's true

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,490
on a fine granular sense we work with

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,050
communities like Rdio and over and

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,790
bluster and those things aren't

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,740
necessarily really that related to

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,450
makers put on a grander scale open

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,860
source is very much an important to the

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,630
maker community or at least I think it

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,790
should be and that's what this talk is

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,260
about so presumably since you're all

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,850
here you already all know what open

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,619
sources or if you didn't this morning

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,570
you do now so let's talk about what I

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,400
makers I have a bit of a love-hate

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,290
relationship for this work I love it

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,870
because it's very definitive it tells

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,600
you quite essentially what it is made

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,700
herb one who makes problem i have with

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,920
the word is because it gives people sort

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,959
of they go to certain things like maybe

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,459
them bags me or they make a baker is

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,980
somebody who plays with our burritos and

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,580
leds and makes things blink you can make

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,110
things that don't blink it's true they

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,620
think of 3d printers they think it'd be

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,410
very narrow field of making but in

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,000
reality a maker is someone who makes it

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,190
is something about what you have made

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
and it doesn't matter if it's good to

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,360
you if it's good to anyone else what is

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,860
important is that you have created if

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,110
it's a bucket of sand that you turned

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,820
upside down and called a sand castle you

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,410
are a maker and what i love about this

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,209
other sand castle is it says anything

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,830
once which like I said is basically my

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,840
Maker philosophy i will make anything

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,310
absolutely once and then i may go that

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,900
was dumb idea i've never doing that

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,360
again we as humans are makers it is

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,850
absolutely intrinsic to our nature it is

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,860
part of who we are so there's this path

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,780
that many of us take as individuals over

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,120
our lives that I think mirrors our

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,530
behavior as a species over the last tens

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,850
of thousands of years or so so we're

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,820
going to go back through the history of

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,400
humans creating in topologically

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,740
speaking we largely recognize humans to

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,650
have begun when

00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,570
are we making tools sticks and stones

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,490
but lots of other creatures use tools as

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,680
well and so humans are specifically

00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,110
defined as creatures who use tools to

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,700
make other tools and so then we marked

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,650
being in the Stone Age by when Fred

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,450
Flintstone a bit at the really good yeah

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,560
I just fine for those of you place over

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,730
in history class I want to make sure

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,610
you're coming along with me it's going

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,440
to get good yeah the stony just marked

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,850
by the beginning of stone tools which is

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,850
about two and a half million years ago

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,910
these tools changed our existence to our

00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:01,130
very survival up until then a lot of our

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,020
food that wasn't gathered the meat sort

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,700
of food was whatever other features had

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,530
left behind because we didn't have the

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,540
ability to throw a spear at something

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,860
far away or to rip into something with

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,080
really tough flesh with our with our

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,180
teeth and so so tools gave us

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,530
independence which is really important

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,950
later as I talk about what the maker

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,989
movement is shortly thereafter we

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,000
developed a taste for not just the

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,640
function of things but for the asst that

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,410
we discovered parked some archaeologists

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,650
argue that there's art as much as a

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,750
hundred thousand years ago in paleo a

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,370
Paleolithic era and so much like you did

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,130
when you were five years old we started

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,510
by painting our hands on cave walls put

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,770
your hand up there and blow some dust

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,750
and that's why they're all in relief

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,160
this is quite a bit of this Manos and

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,200
Argentina this is actually only about

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,900
ten to twelve thousand years old and

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,210
they came better cave art and drawing

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,070
and sculpture and the Bradshaw paintings

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,020
on in Australia and the Wonder working

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,180
cravings in Africa petroglyphs in

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,400
valcamonica we see this all over the

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,500
world wherever humans were arising there

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,290
was art and our tools and recreation

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,390
they were makers then with metal tools

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,310
we develop agriculture and machines and

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,320
ever more complicated machines that did

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,910
ever more complicated tasks taking us to

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,160
the furthest reaches of the earth and

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,900
eventually often we are up towards the

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Stars and so there's a little

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,840
bittersweet note in here into the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,730
picture I chose for the Space Shuttle is

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
what I took from the launch of sts-135

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,760
which was the final shuttle mission but

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,060
what's important is that you went from

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,370
this to this ultimately the same innate

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,890
spirit to make from the same fundamental

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,690
part of what makes us human but in order

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,280
for any of that to happen he didn't have

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,500
to just be makers we also had to be

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,030
shares creatures were willing to tell

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,130
one another while we had discovered what

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,110
we had made and how to do it how to turn

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,460
a stick into a spear or how to float

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,040
pigment around her hand to make an

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,630
impression on the wall and it's

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,970
somewhere along the way we developed a

00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,040
bit of a sense of possessiveness and I

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,690
like to imagine this that this is these

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,130
are my friends augen parag who I like to

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,540
talk about their my caveman friends

00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,220
because I don't have a natural

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,780
anthropological evidence for this I just

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,120
like to imagine that one day I came

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,430
along and said he croc how you make that

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,220
pop it and awesome go get your own

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,240
lightning bolt and then I'd like to

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,310
assume that they were actually really

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,240
good friends until odd made bacon and

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,740
mental dragged Erick from let's talk

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,420
back our time I talked about how that

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,710
whole sharing thing got derailed by

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,070
something besides bacon is delicious

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,400
what this is we fast forward to about

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,990
500 BC in Greece there was an area

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,250
called sybaris and you can see that it

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,620
turned out really welcome this is about

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,560
all that's left they have fitted patents

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,880
on luxury and the the super IDEs and I

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,580
did have one thing in common they

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,680
considered luxury delicious food and so

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,780
you were awarded a patent on any

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,100
particularly innovative culinary delight

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,460
that you would come up with you got the

00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,960
Prophet solely for a single year and

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,910
they actually became well known for this

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,040
and so now the English words civil

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,560
rights of Riddick basically mean opulent

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,680
luxury and fantasticness of this sort in

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,540
the Roman Empire blacksmith literally

00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,370
use trademarks marks of their trade to

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,620
mark the things they had made some

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,350
anthropologists also argue that they

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,140
created sort of a precursor to trade

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,060
secrets because of the simple concept of

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,320
what happens if I owned a slave who then

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,969
learns all of the things about my

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,289
business and I

00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:19,039
tell him if he takes that knowledge with

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,899
him we then assumed the first copyright

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,849
battle to have taken place a couple

00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,159
hundred more years later there is this

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,169
fantastic fat man named st. Columba who

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,879
was an Irish Gaelic missionary and he

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,619
and a number of other apostles lived

00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,169
with a guy named st. Finian which always

00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:35,119
going along swimmingly until one day

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,389
when st. Ninian third wife colombo was

00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:39,709
doing which was copies with books and

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,599
this is what columbia is historically

00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,089
known for he spent his entire life day

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,439
and night up until the minute he died

00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:48,829
painstakingly had copying books because

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,869
they didn't have Watchers and so then

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:52,429
one day Finian discovers that Columbia

00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:54,229
has taken a particular book from his

00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,179
library copying it he goes that's not

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,769
cool so that coffee you me that belongs

00:07:56,179 --> 00:08:00,289
to me because that was my book into the

00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,029
copy of it that is also my book pinon

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,489
basically declared illegal copying and

00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,829
he went to the king the king despite

00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:08,749
being Columbus cousin ruled Finian's

00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,519
favor and famously said to every cow

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,679
belongs its calf to every book that's

00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:14,089
coffee and Irish Gaelic is really hard

00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:17,059
to pronounce him so I call him King

00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:19,069
copyright by copyright erson and then

00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:20,629
there was a battle in a place that I

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,309
also cannot pronounce because Irish

00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,989
Gaelic and but other people called the

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:26,119
battle of the book for obvious reasons

00:08:23,989 --> 00:08:28,639
which resulted in the death of 3,000

00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:31,819
people and pull on this exile over one

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,349
book getting copy in less deadly news

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,569
unless they were actually using Cylons

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,039
in 1266 the english parliament declared

00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:38,750
that all painters had to mark their

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,149
breath with their company name basically

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,550
and because i had no pictures of bread

00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:47,240
from 1266 england i went with Cylon

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,129
toast I don't also think about food i

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,600
also like beer and Lowenbrau has

00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,860
essentially the oldest trademark they've

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,399
been using subversion of this alliance

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,529
since 1383 and then the first true

00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,480
patents were granted in 15th century

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,519
Italy for glass makers in Venice and

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,839
then England caught on to the idea of

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,790
patents as a way to theoretically

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,410
encourage innovation but a reality of

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,269
became a way to encourage monopolies and

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,069
that's pretty much instantly they

00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,970
invented patented use at about five

00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:15,260
minutes later proper form

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,270
17-10 is the statute of Anne which is

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,100
pretty well recognized as the first real

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,510
modern Copyright Act and then trade

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,490
secret law came into existence in

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,890
England in the US and the early 1800s

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,390
and that fast forward had brings us up

00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,920
to what we recognize as relatively

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,840
modern times and you all do that pretty

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,430
well because you've had the internet so

00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,900
let's reflect on that zip zip through

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,610
history that we took from sharing in

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,800
order to eat and survive to this

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,870
exploding system of protecting in mine

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,420
mine mine and think about it on the

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,490
scale of one person's life when you were

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,790
a child pretty much the first thing that

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,440
you're taught the size potty training is

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,910
sharing your parents tell you to share

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,650
share with your brothers and sisters

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,630
share that cookie share that toy share

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,070
with your friends but this for some

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,840
reason all the adults teaching that

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,180
lesson seem to have completely forgotten

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,400
it themselves they somewhere along the

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,530
way simply stopped sharing they want

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,720
longer copyright terms and more patents

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,130
awarded and what shrouds and secrecy and

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,400
all of this protection of their

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,900
creations instead of sharing them in the

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,790
end were no different from OGG and grog

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,410
eventually we're both going to make the

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,210
fire and when doing the fire is going to

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,490
take us to the moon but it happens so

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,680
much faster and so much better and so

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,830
much more successfully if they did it

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,030
together likewise krog eventually is

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,350
going to share his discovery kind of

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,110
sharp in a spear together they're going

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,700
to have a fine Robbins dinner but we

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,590
spent centuries trying to squirrel away

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,750
our secrets instead of sharing them to

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,850
hold our creation since when we believe

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,470
they're in a state to be shared which in

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,250
reality probably means in a state that

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,350
they're very difficult to copy it's this

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,910
idea what if I pictures disappeared i'm

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,140
sorry it's actually a really it's a

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,450
great picture of a traffic sign that

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,580
says secret bunker that way we've been

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,560
mittens of concept of luxury brands and

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,810
a need for them we've invented a culture

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,070
of consuming and disposing and i don't

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,350
know what happened my images are very

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,070
sorry instead of creating and rebuilding

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,690
we're disposing so the maker movement is

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,820
the slice of humanity that said it

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,670
enough we're done with that we want to

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,830
be able to rebuild and ryu

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,660
and create our own things and build a

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,190
better society off of it it's these

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,020
people who have recognized that need

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,390
within themselves and within others to

00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,680
create and a share and so the next thing

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,780
I want to talk about is Maker Faires

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,220
which this is a picture from one of the

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,200
world Maker Faires and it was incredibly

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,420
hard to pick a picture of use for this

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,100
because it's I love everything that

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,600
happens at maker faire and it's all so

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,730
different it's like trying to pick your

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,740
favorite child it's not okay and so I

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,270
went with the maker robot is kind of

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,970
their emblem in the show off because I

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,380
have shop-bought jealousy so it's

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,660
labeled the greatest show it's hell on

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,250
earth and make repairs are designed to

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,870
be a place where makers share their

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,570
creations get ideas from one another

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,130
thrive together but of course people

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,540
didn't just start creating and making

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,520
things from somebody's lap the word make

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,140
on Dale Dougherty to be specific and

00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,480
started reading a magazine about it that

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,400
wasn't how obviously we have always been

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,170
making it they're always been crafters

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,210
and creators and tinker's it's simply

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,100
what we did you major close because

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,390
that's how you got your clothes and you

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,980
fix your television when it broke

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,380
because you can fix your television when

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,360
it broke that's what people did but it's

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,100
also because you could it's because the

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,590
parts were available to do so it's

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,210
because you had that option as a

00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,130
seamstress let me tell you there were a

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,020
lot more fabric stores even 20 or 30

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,580
years ago and now I'm down to a really

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,750
terrible joannes where there's a to our

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,540
way to the cutting table with really

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,790
surly women I don't recommend it

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,260
so increasingly close up things that

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,390
made it more difficult to do yourself

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,980
until we arrived at this and it will

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,390
eventually in this talk sound like I

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,310
have the world's biggest iphone cater

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,930
but in reality it's just this easy and

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,280
convenient representation of what we've

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,170
become as a culture and what we've done

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,420
two devices it's the seemingly

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,670
ubiquitous device but you cannot so much

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,830
has changed the battery in yourself if I

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,810
you told my parents in like say nineteen

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,510
ninety eight or so that I wanted this

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,270
thing even you know even as windows 98

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,590
88 whatever you were a kid mom I'd like

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,210
you to buy me this thing that I'm going

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,890
to use every day and that's eventually

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,170
it's going to have problems but you

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,810
can't change the batteries your mother

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,160
had told me you were insane she would

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,810
have told you to go buy a tam ago she

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,370
and have fun with it this is a book that

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,710
i really like it's called finish

00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:22,000
tomorrow published by o'reilly and it's

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,710
a connects this desire to make things

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,630
with the steam punk movement and

00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,340
initially it's like yeah what does that

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,170
have to do with one another but the two

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,000
people who wrote it it's a futurist end

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,310
of historian and they recognize that

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,960
this whole steampunk thing kind of

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,080
became popular about the same time this

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,880
whole maker thing became popular and so

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,070
steampunk is a modern take on usually

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,840
Victorian times you can kind of boil it

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,280
down to basically thinking of modern

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,870
technology but if it were still powered

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,270
by steam if we never went past that

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,160
steam conquers our frequently makers and

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,140
I'm not sure I've ever met one who

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,600
wasn't they have this desire to create

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,340
to make there's a huge crossover and so

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,220
the book describes the simultaneous

00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,500
arrival as connected through this common

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,850
desire to return to a time when we did

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,190
these things for ourselves when we were

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:10,020
makers and so steampunk is this previous

00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:11,980
time and and it all works out and so the

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,650
common thread is that we want to learn

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,240
to go back to this time would we make

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,340
things between no longer Jews as

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,950
reflected in the main motto if you can't

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,410
open it you don't own it which makes it

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,540
seem like by their nature the maker

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,400
movement would be open by default but

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,380
what I have learned is that it is really

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,329
really not and sort of disappointingly

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,429
so no one is in

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,899
czyli sharing or intentionally creating

00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,489
derivative works and building up one

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,319
another the truth is it's quite the

00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:40,059
opposite and I'm afraid growing in the

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,410
wrong direction and so that's what I

00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,420
want all of you to take away from this

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,920
is that you can go out and help change

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,160
that to the way it should be going to

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,449
help makers become more open so because

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,860
the maker movement makes you think of

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:51,970
our tomatoes and leafy things and 3d

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,069
printers we're going to use them for an

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,009
example and look at the open hardware

00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:59,230
movement which again by its name sounds

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,489
like it's open by default and I don't

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,110
want to denigrate them because these are

00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:03,759
fantastic people and the open hardware

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,790
definition I had a lot of work go into

00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,220
it but I first attended the open

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,299
hardware summit in person they stream

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,799
the whole thing online it's not a

00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:14,439
conference like this it's just one stage

00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,329
and talks go across all day I first one

00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,589
2012 largely as a writer for open source

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,879
com I thought it sounded really

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,799
interesting I thought there's gonna be a

00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,769
lot that would be relevant to us they

00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,929
had a super awesome Sylvia was 11 years

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:29,110
old that she's this kid who has her own

00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:32,110
maker of webcast on YouTube there was a

00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,809
77 year old named pat delany who made a

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,100
late / mill / drill drill out of scrap

00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,139
metal for one hundred and fifty dollars

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,369
and said here's how you can do it and so

00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,389
I was interested in all these projects

00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:42,189
and thought there would be a lot of pro

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,350
crossover would open source software and

00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,869
then I came back and this is definitely

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,610
my room and that was pretty much the

00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:50,350
optimistic version like this was the

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:52,720
most promising headline i could write

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,730
about what i experienced it wasn't a

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,049
culture of open by default but open by

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:00,399
accident essentially people who came the

00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,529
the grew up with the internet and so

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,579
they said i'm going to put my thing

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,679
online because that's kind of what you

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:07,119
do but doesn't mean open source of them

00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,559
it didn't meet openness it was just said

00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:12,610
I just you know kind of showed what I

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,749
did the opening keynote was by chris

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,399
anderson who was at the time

00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:17,169
editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,459
this was his opening sentence for the

00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:20,350
beginning of open hardware summit

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:21,879
everything I've learned as I built my

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,889
own business is because people share

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,569
what they knew but then he went on to

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,079
talk about the limitations of open

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:31,389
hardware and he finally said that the

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,129
solution is alternatives like maybe a

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,470
conditional license with restrictions on

00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:37,329
commercial use or only releasing the

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,879
schematics or having open software on

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,440
closed hardware and finally you said I

00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,180
don't

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,830
we should be dogmatic about this we need

00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,010
to consider other possibilities and

00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:50,670
approaches to open based innovation not

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,350
open innovation somewhere along the

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,720
afternoon on the schedule was bre pettis

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,250
who you may recognize is the founder of

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,350
makerbot industries that MakerBot 3d

00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,000
printer the reason it was really

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,710
interesting that day was because it was

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,420
about three days after MakerBot

00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,970
announced that the replicator 2 would

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,650
not be open through even that is

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,420
interesting is because bri had spent

00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,860
several of the previous years giving

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,600
interviews like the one on the left in

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,640
which he talked about how critical it

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,410
was to be open you can't see that the

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,240
back he says in the future people will

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,709
remember businesses that refuse to share

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,620
with their customers and wonder how they

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,930
could be so backwards and then two years

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,490
later when people had cloned the

00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,470
MakerBot he said you know what we decide

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:33,030
we're not really okay with that and so

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:34,800
we're closing it up for presenters and

00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,570
attendees I kept her in the same sorts

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,070
of stories of open by accident rather

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,070
than open intentionally open by default

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,130
I saw almost no linux it was all windows

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,840
mostly baths and several of the first

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,970
open harbor summits were held right

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,070
before New York Maker Faire and so then

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,910
i would go to maker faire and it was

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,770
about the same time that I started

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,330
presenting projects and presenting it as

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,860
a speaker at the world Maker Faires at

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,030
local Mini Maker Faire see so i got this

00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,400
habit of walking around to the other

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,310
makers at the Maker Faires and asking

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,650
some simple questions things like is

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,660
this open hardware are your plans online

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,370
have you shared this anywhere is there

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,930
anything open about this I don't think

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,560
I've ever asked quite that placing huh

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,970
depends on the project and over the last

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,220
few years I feel like there's been a

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,140
subtle but important change from the

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,540
greatest show-and-tell honor to the

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,670
greatest show and sell honor and I don't

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,560
mean to say I dislike Maker Faires

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,180
anymore i love them i think they're an

00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,170
important thing but i also really

00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,670
believe that they should go back to

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,150
something more like what they were

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:35,100
several years ago every time i would ask

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,050
is this open hardware does it use open

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,880
hardware is there anything open about

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,270
this the answer

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,190
be I can sell you one and the sponsors

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,560
at maker faire has started to change too

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,970
and I don't have a problem with sponsors

00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,770
is a conference planner at a conference

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,020
attendee I understand sponsors are

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,580
critical to your existence but there's a

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,350
big difference between deaths which is

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,450
the radio shock jock learn to solder

00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,950
boob and really like human hair thought

00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,270
radio shop is still relevant and yet

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,830
some of them actually are doing a really

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,230
good job in this artery no makerspace

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,850
some of them are just cell phone stores

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,140
but radioshack would sponsor this learn

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,060
to solder booth and teach you to make a

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,600
little a little blinking thing because

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:14,030
things blue spark lon is another Maker

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,470
Faire sponsor who this is another learn

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,660
to solder the sparkfun does a lot of

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,530
events and and teaches you to make

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,820
things blink it's true but there's a big

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,460
difference between these types of

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,690
sponsors and the one that almost

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,100
single-handedly set me down this line of

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,710
thinking of what happened to maker faire

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,360
and I couldn't even find a picture of it

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,040
online which I think suggests that it

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,080
was that embarrassing so I had to use

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,530
their press release there was a massive

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,030
Purina booth which apparently elevated

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,270
the feeding experience for all the cats

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,460
at maker faire good job trevena and your

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,900
sour cream container with holes punched

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,160
in it which seems to be making things no

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,200
this is this is what i mean by the

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,120
changing face of what's happening in the

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,310
Maker Faires but not all of that is the

00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,870
downside so let's go back to why all

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,100
this matters so we see why it's

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,190
important to encourage the maker

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,200
community towards openness as all of us

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,690
are believers in the open source

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,760
software and any importance of it it's

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,810
easy for us to forget why it's important

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,550
because we spent a lot of time just

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,480
knowing that it is and assuming that it

00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,300
is and we don't spend a lot of time

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,460
thinking about why anymore so why does

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,880
it matter if makers share what they

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,370
create here's here's my Maker friend

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,290
he's today's maker and that means he's

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,510
the inventor of tomorrow's device he

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,520
makes this thing it might be a toy or an

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,260
article of clothing or it might be

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,000
something really important something to

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,860
save someone like someone's life or

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,890
changes a lot of lives for the better

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,780
and so someone comes along and finds

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,100
that device and learns more about it and

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,190
maybe all she can do is change the

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,230
batteries and that's

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,539
but maybe she makes it into something

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,820
better and that means that she's the

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,980
next maker and it's a cycle and it

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,399
continues and this is a cycle that can

00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,809
happen if any of those pieces breaks it

00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:59,190
causes problems that similar the

00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:01,440
situations you're familiar with and

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,059
software things like security flaws

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,889
whether it's in software or hardware

00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,169
openness means audit it means better

00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:09,000
software for everyone we've seen what

00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,289
happens with DRM and then over the last

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,299
year we've heard more and more about

00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,669
insecurity and networking and other

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,320
hardware even in New York Times Abed

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:18,629
which is what this is from put it to

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,490
open hardware as a key for a more secure

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:22,259
internet and so those of you who are a

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,570
little bit older can think about what it

00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:27,120
means that even in New York Times has

00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,919
printed open hardware is the key to a

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,340
secure internet and how crazy that might

00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,929
have sounded even ten years ago closing

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,000
up things also leads to expensive

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,620
repairs and repair contracts instead of

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,679
empowering you to fix things yourselves

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,629
so it turns out a third of iphone users

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,070
damaged their device which i think is

00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:46,049
supported by the number of people I see

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,500
typing on crack screams like that one in

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:51,480
the iphone for repair required 27 screws

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,610
and three layers of separation and a

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,049
whole lot of time in the iphone 5 it was

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,360
five screws and two layers this sounds

00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,480
like an improvement except then to give

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,580
this independently repaired the cost

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,200
increased a whole lot and so a lot of

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,929
his independent vendors from the iphone

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,429
5 came along said not doing the repairs

00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:09,870
you can just take your little self over

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:11,700
to Apple it's going to cost you a lot

00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,409
less than a lot less heartache for me

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,610
and of course then to do it yourself

00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,110
with instructions on YouTube it costs

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,549
about twenty-five bucks but i'm pretty

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,940
sure i was little and applecare off of

00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:23,009
the situation but it's not just iphones

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,720
it's repairs in general repair shops are

00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,279
going out of business shoe repair shops

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,679
TV repair shops like how many of you

00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:31,679
even remember a TV repairman existing in

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,480
your neighborhood I mean I'm 36 I don't

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,110
remember

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,910
actually having pin 21 to be honest now

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,580
we just Austin going to do it and that

00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:43,669
leads to piles and piles of e-waste so

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,080
much e waste which is not just a pile of

00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:47,360
crap but it's actually got a lot of

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,730
dangerous chemicals in it the US alone

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,950
has gone from producing two million tons

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:54,350
of e-waste in two thousand five to nine

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:56,390
million in 2012 and it's just going up

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,260
from there these are the average life

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:01,580
spans of those devices in the US and

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,440
it's generated not only because people

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,059
want the new and shiny thing but because

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,360
the devices have become difficult to

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:09,799
repair or to upgrade but it's not just

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,510
about these disadvantages to closing

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,130
it's also about the advantages to being

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,600
open from the beginning now majors

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,100
definitely skewed towards a younger

00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,140
generation which is not to say that

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,330
there are plenty of makers on every

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,620
demographic but there's definitely this

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,120
group that has grown up with the

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,679
internet and like I said all of those

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,450
people who weren't open hardware summit

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,470
sharing because the internet was there

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,730
and that was just kind of what they'd

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,919
always done was tell people on the

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,290
internet but they had done they have

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,320
this secondary problem and it comes from

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,059
that innate desire to be a maker and

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,830
that is that their accomplishments now

00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:41,960
have become largely virtual and it

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,429
requires at least a phone and probably

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,290
an internet connection to show you this

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:47,000
cool app I me or this website that I

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,000
made and so there's this growing desire

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,299
to have created something tangible

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,010
besides them sooner kanwal and thus

00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:58,370
sprung up websites like indestructible

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:07,610
oh my well that's special do I get it

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:08,840
back I don't get it back okay well i'm

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,150
just going to relaunch and prosecute

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,160
talking to you about the website how

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,100
many of you have been to a website like

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,710
instructables or thingiverse or ravelry

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,400
or what's happening on this side of the

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,980
room like there's a large type of people

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,570
okay nothing somebody who's sitting over

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,600
here tell me the coolest thing you have

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,860
ever made with your hands i'm going to

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,060
start pointing to people cuz I'm silver

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,200
silver I'm a dulcimer yeah yeah yeah so

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,340
make show me something we made with a

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,340
raspberry pi like give you a book

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,950
I think we establish blinking lights so

00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,800
we have these cool websites where you

00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,480
can share things and make that whole

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,090
cycle have been faster happen more

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,200
easily it was really difficult it didn't

00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,580
happen before the internet because

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,470
basically we need to the internet the

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,790
disciple to keep happening it makes it

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,920
possible it makes the learning easier

00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,600
and then it makes the manufacturing and

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,970
this sourcing and the marketing easier

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,770
the entire cycle things that used to

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,470
take years and years and tens of

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,270
thousands of dollars now don't require

00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,890
that or a bunch of guys sitting around a

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,510
desk signing papers which all of it did

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,970
before and just having the phobias

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,980
living room or more likely in a

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,750
hackerspace now I kind of use the words

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,070
hacker space and vapors space relatively

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,870
interchangeably and we could argue later

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,850
about the fine distinctions but just

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,250
roll with me for now you only have so

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,750
much time this is from a hacker space in

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,780
for Atlanta that's really great way to

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,310
decorate the wall in fact make was

00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,560
originally going to be called hack and

00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,660
Dale Dougherty's daughter was like half

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,360
has some bad connotations and so that

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,770
was how it had to be made so if you

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,480
heard me give a talk before you know

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,980
that I send you home with a reading list

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,900
so we have finished tomorrow's next up

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,640
is to make her movement manifesto which

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,860
was written by Mark hatch he didn't

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,680
start tech shops but he's the CEO of the

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,600
peasants it's about 2007 tech shops are

00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,040
a for-profit chain of hacker spaces

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,070
essentially a place where you can go and

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,050
get access to all of those great tools

00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:13,910
he has a pretty bold vision for tech

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,190
shop he believes that it has a unique

00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,720
opportunity to arm a maker movement army

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,370
with the tools it needs to change itself

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,260
in the world basically you sayin

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,540
techshop can do exactly what i am asking

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,330
all of you to go forth and help the open

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,670
source community do but he spent the

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,990
whole book backing up his pieces so much

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,250
so that after a while the stories and

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,200
books are filled or a little repetitive

00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,100
on my great guy founded company it was

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,260
successful oh

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,150
successful somebody else yeah but

00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,370
they're all great stories tetra patch

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,929
square which is the little Payment

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,850
device that I'm sure you use it summoned

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,740
up in a coffee shop and DODOcase which

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,809
are these little phone flash wallet

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,210
cases and these are both really good

00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:53,460
stories in the book about the success of

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,289
failing fast how failing fast leads to

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,700
succeeding quickly and how building

00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:58,559
something at an open space like tech

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,809
shop or another hacker space led to a

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,789
better product and so this book at story

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,410
after story like this and almost all of

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:05,940
them are not engineers the new

00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,740
background is using any of the tools in

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,659
touch shop we walked in one day and a

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,309
week later or a month later or six

00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,080
months or a year later has a huge

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,760
successful business but I have to tell

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,309
you about my favorite one a favorite

00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,320
story in the whole book hatches walking

00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:21,690
around tech shop asking people what are

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,549
you working on and he runs into this guy

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,500
this middle-aged guy who's working on

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:27,690
this thing that he describes us it

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,620
poorly constructed clunky aluminum block

00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,330
like structure and guy says i'm working

00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,570
on a desktop diamond manufacturing

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,070
device and then our hash besides he's a

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,620
little bit crazy but he says oh yeah

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,990
tell me more the guy said yes all I need

00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,730
now is to rip a magnetron out of a

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:48,179
microwave for the necessary plasma ball

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:50,549
and I think I'm good another me sir is

00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,799
calling him crazy bike but it turns out

00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:54,360
crazy Mike is actually a physicist who

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,039
works at a diamond deposition tool

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,559
company he actually has experience in

00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,419
this and in hopes of succeeding and his

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,919
end goal which is fantastic is to make a

00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,750
diamond ring for his wife and I don't

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,539
mean like a ring with a diamond I mean a

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,919
freaking of time and then she can wear

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,630
what's important about this story is he

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,960
doesn't matter it crazy Mike ever

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:14,610
succeed it's a matter that he estimated

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,070
from his industry experience that even

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,950
try this through the normal means would

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,200
have cost him $80,000 but a tech shop it

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,080
cost him one thousand dollars that is a

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,929
literally industry-changing factor of

00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,330
cost and put the story after story of

00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,980
people with successes like this things

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,230
that used to take months or years to

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,840
source a manufacturer

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,700
that will take a week when you've gone

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,340
from your life savings and a year of

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,620
your life to a quarterly bonus and a

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,110
week or a month that's a sort of change

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,600
that can completely turn around ha Rd

00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,919
and manufacturing in the entire way we

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,919
know tangible goods come into existence

00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,419
works and the openness and sharing of

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,520
that process the fact that it happens

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:58,190
with other people is absolutely critical

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,540
to making it happen at all so I'll tell

00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,040
you a few more examples of great things

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,690
for having I think some of the most

00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,940
interesting or in the bio hackerspaces

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,950
so if I Oh hyperspace simply means

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,559
instead of a CNC machine at a 3d printer

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,120
they have pcr machines of DNA isolation

00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,890
and seemed for few jizz and incubators

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,020
and microscopes and basically a

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,280
university biology lab except anybody

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,350
can use it without the trappings of

00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,200
academia and an advisor telling you what

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,059
your lab work on and then come out with

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,520
some really interesting successes and if

00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,559
you ever happen to encounter one at a

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,049
conference like this at this past I

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,790
guess January and scale of the Sun

00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:34,370
California Linux expo they had a

00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:37,280
biohacker space there and they let you

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:44,240
paint with e.coli on tree dishes which

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:46,090
is super fun and it's see ecoli also i

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,890
don't recommend licking your paintings

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,660
but if you google ecoli paintings people

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,700
do really cool stuff for this and that's

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,559
that's the fun side of makers obviously

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,600
there are way more useful things but you

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,770
call my paints also then I lost in my

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,790
bedroom for a really long time and I

00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,790
found it is not as cool

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,880
there are also projects like those that

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,190
spawned out of the Fukushima disaster

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,809
and in particular with the Tokyo

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:10,850
hackerspace and some groups that were

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,559
working with raspberry PI's and the

00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,049
community felt like it wasn't getting

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,970
accurate or enough data about radiation

00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:18,559
and the truth about the radiation that

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,779
they were encountering on a daily basis

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,220
anymore and so this is actually still

00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,350
existing based on that infrastructure

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,539
they set up its accurate radiation

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,820
readings based on open hardware that

00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:30,620
this is a yahoo site that pulls their

00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,340
open data and puts it into a map for

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,440
anyone to use my final story isn't about

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,929
project it's for those of you who like

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,700
me your parents and it's perhaps your

00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:42,440
job more than anyone elses to encourage

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,190
your children to go into all of these

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,990
things this is a kid named Jack and and

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,940
he's really cool in that he won the

00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,340
intel science fair reward when he was 15

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,230
years old for developing a test for the

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,450
early stages of pancreatic ovarian and

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,539
lung cancer which is super cool but i

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:02,600
think his mom was great i read the

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:06,139
interview with her and she's anestis an

00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,419
assist and they asked about having a son

00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:10,250
who was doing this stuff so his school

00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:12,169
made him take his homemade arc furnace

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,960
back to his house because you know fire

00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:17,029
and they asked his mom what she thought

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,379
and she said I told him don't burn down

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,879
the house or kill yourself or your

00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:23,169
brothers I don't know enough physics and

00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:23,169
math nope that's a death rate or not

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:28,470
but she didn't tell him no and that's

00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,450
the important part she told him to go do

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,070
it heck Adam knows you built a Death Ray

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,820
but if you did a good job don't kill

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:37,739
anybody with it and all of that is the

00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,440
power of the maker and you already know

00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:42,570
the power of open source and we all know

00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,999
the importance now of creating to

00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,190
humanity and so I believe it's up to us

00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:48,989
you and me and all of the rest of the

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,210
open source software community who is c4

00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:52,950
for more years than the burgeoning Bay

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,749
current open hardware communities the

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,029
importance of openness and how much more

00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:59,249
successful it is in the alternative to

00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:00,869
go out there go forth and become a part

00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:02,999
of these communities and to share with

00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:04,679
them what we've learned you all believe

00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:06,090
in open and you know now what you

00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,609
thought so in the beginning or not that

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,899
you are all makers so go forth and make

00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:11,899
