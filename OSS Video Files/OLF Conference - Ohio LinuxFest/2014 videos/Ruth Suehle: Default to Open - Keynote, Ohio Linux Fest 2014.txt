With visions of Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, Thingiverse and Instructables, it looks on the surface to many that the maker community is also an open source community. But is it? What does "open source" mean beyond code, and how does it apply to the maker community? Is the maker community open by default (or should it be)? Take a trip back through the long history of making and short history of makers to see where open source fits in and where we should be headed.
