pretty cool thank you very much Brian I

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,319

everybody else is on the list we'll see

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,790
if Brian doesn't take the whole time

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,199
fine here five minutes this meal last

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,699
villainous job transfer is one more

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,070
anything Thanks how many more do you

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,390

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm not going to be quick enough to get

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,949
the hallway decide how many of you are

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,059

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,309

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:48,210
this is mostly for you my calls k by BBC

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,280
and somehow I got wrangled into being

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,170
the president of my radio club because I

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,960
knew something about computers I don't

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,050
know how that happened I show up within

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,579
a couple weeks of being there I've got

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,859
them spending thousands of dollars on

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,510
your computers in a place that doesn't

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,770
want spend any money next thing you know

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,650
I'm the president those of you that

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,140
don't know what it is you know I'm sure

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,119
you've heard of Katrina that horrible

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,780
disaster or the hurricane basically

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,700
wiped out Katrina and there was no

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,799
communications there is no

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,710
infrastructure everything was more or

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,159
less wiped out the original news reports

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:32,610
after Katrina said everything was fine

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,180
they said that the storm missed Katrina

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,430
and the reason that happened is because

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,310
the infrastructure that the folks that

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,270
used to gather their news was completely

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,000
knocked out they couldn't communicate

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,810
that you know what's happening the first

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,170
successful communication out of that

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,950
area was amateur radio operators when

00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:55,299
911 happened in New York most of the

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,909
communication infrastructure was

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,220
completely overwhelmed cell towers they

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,750
might have been working but they weren't

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,970
doing anybody any good because they were

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,740
so flooded with calls that emergency

00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,369
traffic wasn't happening so again

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,959
amateur radio operators step in and help

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,840
local officials whether it be the police

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,150
the fire the EMTs communicate with each

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,299
other now government agencies typically

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,640
have to run radio systems but sometimes

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,680
those systems get knocked out we're very

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,569
good at making our systems work even

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,670
when nothing else is working almost

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,410
everything we use is I is designed to

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,239
work off of 12 volts so in a real

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:33,459
pinching and running repeater of a car

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,860
battery and tank a gas as long as you

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:41,049
need to if you don't know anything about

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,780
it check it out it's a really cool hobby

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:47,590
and it ties in a lot of different

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,239
technologies it used to be aware if you

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,269
have emergency communications all you

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,600
had was voice nets you know we call it

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,459
the net everybody would log on I'd only

00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,859
a bunch time everybody would log on to

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,100
the net check in and pass mergency

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:05,109
traffic they're trying to move where

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,579
most of the emergency Nets these days

00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:08,650
they're still voice for command and

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,959
control but we're trying to move the

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:16,989
important data and bulk data / digital

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:20,470
modes so you have your laptop and in the

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,600
case of West Pennsylvania Aries we use a

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,540
piece of software called FL vision and

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,299
FL message and with these digital

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:31,750
programs which were written for Linux

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:34,030
run Linux very well ported to windows

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,230
which makes it wonderfully across

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,170
platform because not only

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,510
yes a linux box you go to an emergency

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,280
communication center you might not be

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,319
but we're all using the same program

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,150
regardless of platform and we can send

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,940
messages digitally across the airwaves

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,620
with depending on the mode with error

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,290
checking so you're making sure the

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,870
message gets there gets there correctly

00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,160
gets for the first time when I lived in

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:03,220
North Texas we had 20 22 touchdown on

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,950
the same day we have a national weather

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,170
service in that we're real time

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,360
technical communications Weather Service

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,250
is actually on the net with us they

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,540
can't see a tornado all the way you know

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,400
there's a tornado is because you have a

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,479
trained spotter who sees it knows what

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,660
it looks like and reports that the

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,850
weather service with that may tornadoes

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,470
touching down the information that the

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,060
amateur radio groups were able to give

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,530
to the weather service there were no

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,330
deaths because everybody had warning

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,590
everybody knew what ares to get out of

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,810
the number of lives you can touch is

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,090
phenomenal with amateur radio and when

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,800
you bring some open source software into

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,750
that stack to allow you to do things

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:47,440
like digitally send hundreds of names or

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,050
send what the rest of need it empowers

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,330
you to do we need to do to help people

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:56,310
touch people's lives and when there's

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,310
not an emergency have a lot of fun doing

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,580
