it's a real pleasure to be here it's an

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,110
honor to be asked to be here to present

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,730
to you I've never given a talk on this

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,980
topic before it's something new to me so

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,970
it's a little little nerve-wracking but

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,230
also very exciting you may not know this

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,029
but six years ago in 2010 myself in the

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,369
nagios team were here at Ohio linux fest

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,460
and at that point we were just about

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,170
nine months into the launch of our first

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,170
commercial product called nagios xiah

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,370
was built around our open source now yes

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,660
project that many of you are familiar

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,910
with we were at a pretty critical stage

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,340
you know in our company it was kind of

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,680
is still super small we had like four

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,170
people five people half of which work

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,550
part time and we are really kind of

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,039
testing the waters like is this thing

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,820
going to work is this this company going

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,309
to work now six years later or just over

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,550
30 employees I think we'll probably

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,149
closer to 35 by the end of this year and

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,619
with some of the things that are

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,330
happening in an obvious and the the

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,670
opportunities that are available to us I

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,670
want to be surprised if we hit 50 this

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,100
time next year so there's an incredible

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,880
I guess growth potential and our company

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,880
it's super exciting we're actually going

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,159
through what I consider to be the second

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,070
or even the third startup stage of our

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,110
company we're looking at things that

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,939
we've got opportunities that are

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,759
available things that we could be doing

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,869
better and kind of revamping things to

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,640
tick us ourselves to the next level so

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:42,840
it's kind of an exciting place for us to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,430
be you know i'm not talking about nagios

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,729
in a technical sense today I'm talking

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,240
about entrepreneurship what it takes to

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,520
be a founder to start something that you

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,520
could take from the idea phase and move

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,670
it into a product or service that you

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,049
develop that hopefully succeeds and a

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,759
lot of challenges along the way you're

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,890
going to run into I'm going to share my

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,350
experiences with Nadia sand other things

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,729
I've started and kind of give you some

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,910
high-level information that if you're

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,900
looking at starting something or you

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,569
know read

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,750
being something you already have going

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:20,040
might hopefully be useful to you and a

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,470
lot of things about entrepreneurship

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,739
aren't just about you know building a

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,810
product building a service developing

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,489
something that's commercial a lot of the

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,269
the things about entrepreneurship

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,560
applied to a lot of things in life you

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,849
know whether you're trying to make a big

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,010
decision in life you're not sure what

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:41,430
direction you want to go or if you can

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,060
do it a big thing about entrepreneurship

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,930
is it's all about believing in yourself

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:52,319
and being willing to take a risk and put

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,989
the work in to try something that you

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,060
believe in you think is a possibility

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,129
that you think you can do even though

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,709
you're not sure if you have all the

00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:04,980
skills of the capabilities or if you

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,599
know everything you need to or you might

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,900
be in place you don't think you have the

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,090
money to do it and you don't know the

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,409
outcome if you're making a big decision

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,470
life you know the future isn't known for

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,230
any of us anything we start in terms of

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,400
a project or a company or when you're

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,709
making a big decision life you don't

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,049
know the outcome hindsight is 2020 it's

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,690
easier for us to look back but you don't

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:30,959
know you know the outcome of anything

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,209
that you start in life so that's kind of

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,099
the whole concept of being an

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,870
entrepreneur you're taking a risk and

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,310
you're trying something that you're not

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,359
sure if it's going to work or not but

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,370
that's a whole concept of it I'll give

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:46,340
you a little bit of my background story

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,060
my experience is in software mainly

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,699
either as a project with nagios and open

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,280
source or commercializing that project

00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,889
or I did some some work in software

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,889
services in the past I'm not a hardware

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,900
guy so my experiences I nothing about

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,379
that world I don't know about building

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,780
hardware building gadgets if you asked

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,159
me to start a retail business making

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,319
clothing I wouldn't know the first thing

00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,739
about it I'd have to learn about it so

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,169
even if you're not interested in

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,789
starting something that's tech a lot of

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,969
these concepts can still be applied to

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,570
you though so a little bit about my

00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,840
background I'm a tech

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,090
by nature I taught myself programming in

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,280
high school I got a seaside agree I've

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,250
had jobs doing anything from phone

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,140
support an ID helpdesk to Windows app

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,120
development web development sysadmin

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,500
network admin stuffs I've got a broad

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,840
range of experience across the IT

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,030
industry i'm not an expert in any

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,340
particular area but i got a broad range

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,100
of experience and i was able to leverage

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,170
that and some of the things that i did

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,170
actually started my first company when I

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,940
was cut in collagen in 95 I was like all

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,310
right I need to make some money I don't

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,950
have any cash in college I want to start

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,020
something new and see if I can you know

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,430
support myself and I thought I had an

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,770
idea that was just going to take off and

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,080
it's going to be awesome and it was an

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:18,510
actual company I learned how to sell I

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,830
learned how to do accounting pay taxes

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,300
at the end of the day when I shut it

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,170
down i think i figured out i worked for

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,150
about fifty cents an hour so from from a

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,610
financial success standpoint it was not

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,040
successful but i took a lot of things i

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,110
learned from that company and my work on

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,740
it and i applied that to future things

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,950
that i did the first monitoring

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,660
application that i wrote my basically my

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,540
intro to the monitoring world which is

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,120
what nagios is about actually happened

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,800
about a year later in college I didn't

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,260
have any goals to build something that

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,300
would you know change an industry or

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,580
wasn't looking to build something that

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,980
would bring in a lot of money I had a

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,080
real simple problem i needed to solve

00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:05,500
and it was actually a social people

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,240
problem that i was trying to solve all I

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,510
wanted to do is to be able to give

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,940
myself and my fellow workers the freedom

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,910
of being able to be out of the office

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,550
but know when a server crash so I wrote

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,970
about a 200 line dos application that

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,670
just really simply pain servers a couple

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,770
times and if they didn't work I and my

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,830
co-workers got a simple lot numeric page

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,050
on our pagers so that was a my first

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,280
invention I guess in the in the

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,080
monitoring space nagios was first

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,100
released as an open source project in

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,620
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,570
I started building it in 1998 because I

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,310
wanted to start a company that would

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,410
offer monitoring services to local

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,820
businesses because I saw that a lot of

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,440
small businesses they didn't you know

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,000
and even in smaller companies they

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,220
didn't know the first thing about what

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,930
it took to actually maintain the systems

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,230
they had in place and things break all

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,460
the time and it looked at the commercial

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,590
solutions that were on the market and

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,540
they were too expensive for me to start

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,490
actually using and start deploying in

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,930
that business and the free and open

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,160
source stuff that was out there didn't

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,440
like the way it was designed to the way

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,290
it worked so I decided to try my own

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,050
application now at that time I decided

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,180
not to go ahead with the business idea I

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,500
didn't launch the business but at that

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,750
point I made the decision to release

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,310
nagios as an open source project and

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:29,050
give it back to the community because i

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,400
was i just discovered linux and GCC i

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,740
thought it was a great that i got a free

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,860
c compiler and I thought nagios could be

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,110
my contribution back to open source not

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,550
yes was a something I started that I

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,160
didn't think was going to succeed

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,170
actually I thought probably at most

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,020
about a dozen people worldwide might be

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,900
interested in it and what happened with

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,030
nagios is amazing it exceeded my wildest

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,430
dreams were that I made it it performed

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,470
much better than my you know my 1995

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,670
business idea where I was going to you

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,830
know do so well but but it you know it

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,200
was an unexpected success or some things

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,940
that you start that you don't think

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,950
would work out might actually work out

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,380
for you in the future I started my

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,190
second company in 2003 at that time I

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,660
was looking to quit my day job be able

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,090
to support myself I don't want to work

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,280
for the man anymore I wanted to do my

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:25,360
own thing and have more time to work on

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,360
nagios which I was a side project and

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,510
and just be able to support myself and I

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,460
did that it was fairly successful in

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,880
that I was actually able to support

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,030
myself and at one point up to two

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,560
part-time employees as well so is pretty

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,419
small but it was self-sustaining and

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,940
that worked out well for a number of

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,110
different years i did a variety of

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,700
different things in there but the first

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,380
thing that i launched that company with

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,600
i have this idea was a million-dollar

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,279
idea or at least i thought

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,620
I'd spend a lot of time building a

00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,420
service that actually very few people

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,699
actually want it so I made the mistake

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,790
of building something that there wasn't

00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,790
a market for so after about a year I

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,470
shut that down and I started to focus on

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,810
things that were related to nagios now

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,980
he was consulting advertising and

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:17,500
eventually in 2007 I formed nagios

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,870
enterprises to officially commercialize

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,279
the nagios project and bring that under

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,449
the nagios name so now yes Enterprise

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,790
this is what I have most of my

00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:29,500
successful experience with but I have

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,389
learned from failures in the past and I

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,940
applied the lessons I learned when I

00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:37,300
actually built nagios enterprises from

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,480
the start so the company itself got its

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,009
its its roots in some advertising I was

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,220
doing website advertising on the nagios

00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:47,910
website and I was commercialized nagas

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,079
in the sense that i was offering

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,839
consultation and implementation services

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,730
for nagios users and I did a lot of

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,649
deployments help people you know

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,689
optimize their configuration or helped

00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:02,889
us set help them get it up and running

00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:04,420
and I asked them a lot of questions and

00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,250
I heard a lot of their feedback about

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,630
Nagas what they what they were looking

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,500
for and what I did as I said okay

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,569
everybody's kind of asking for the same

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,180
thing they want something has more

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:17,410
features that's easier to use and I kept

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,319
track of all those things that people

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,680
were asking me for and I got to a point

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:26,769
in 2009 where I decided look it's time

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,870
to build this this product and the

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,060
actual decision that kind of spurned me

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:36,160
on to build that commercial edition of

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,209
nagios was actually it was the the the

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,829
work that I have been doing with

00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:41,290
consulting and stuff kind of slowed down

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,970
I reached a point where you know I only

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,759
had about four or five months worth of

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,259
financial reserves left and I was at a

00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,240
point where I was either going to be

00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:52,029
homeless or I'd have to go get a real

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,490
job and I didn't want either of those

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,399
things to happen so i decided i'm going

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,470
to try this thing i'm going to build the

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,149
first commercial edition of nagios I'm

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,819
gonna see how this works because I think

00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,769
it has potential I think I made that

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:08,379
decision probably mid

00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,300
September 2009 and I gave myself the

00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:12,309
goal of getting that product out the

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,249
door and launched by the end of the year

00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:18,009
and I did it but it was New Year's Eve

00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:20,649
2009 that I was posted in that hey this

00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,899
is the version 1 point 0 so I just

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,199
barely got it out the door I met my goal

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,970
tho those three and a half months were

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,649
tremendously they were busy they were

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,360
really stressful i was working 100-hour

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,369
weeks for those three and a half months

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,600
and it was exciting there's a lot of

00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:39,429
energy I had to learn a ton of new stuff

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,230
not only a product development but I

00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,629
really didn't have any idea on how to

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,170
sell a product at a market patek product

00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:49,480
I had to revamp the websites build sales

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,999
and marketing material I had to set up

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,799
an e-commerce system and set up

00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,199
essentially a support infrastructure and

00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,660
I was the only guy that could do that I

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:01,389
didn't have the money to hire somebody

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,889
else to help me so I had I had the time

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,499
but I didn't have the money so I had to

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,660
do it and it was an incredible

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:10,990
experience I remember during that the

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,759
dot-com boom in you know around 2000 I'd

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,709
read about the software startups in

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,869
Silicon Valley and I to the photos you

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,610
know of like the the dev sleeping in

00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,350
their sleeping bag in the office you

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,269
know floor and I was like that is so

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,899
cool I wish I could be a part of that

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:27,309
that that energy that it takes to

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,949
actually create something new and get it

00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:32,799
out the door I had the opportunity to do

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,240
that in 2009 I'm glad I did it I don't

00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,420
really ever want to go back and do that

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,309
again that same with Hannah again in the

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,619
future I hope to have more money than

00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:44,490
time and be able to hire people bring in

00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:46,809
a team and say let's do this together

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,029
but I got it out the door and that

00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,740
really launched our commercial success

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,779
we were able to do things like get our

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,259
first office because i was working out

00:12:52,779 --> 00:13:00,279
of the basement at the time and start to

00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:02,860
hire employees at the end of 2010 I set

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,540
a goal for the company that I wanted us

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,889
to hit a million dollars in sales at

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,220
first year because I felt that that was

00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:11,889
is a good guide post that would say hey

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,829
you guys are on the road to success and

00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,759
it we just came in we just hit the mark

00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:17,319
by the end of the year was almost

00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,140
exactly a million dollars and I was like

00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:22,600
yes we did this

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:25,420
you know something worked right and you

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,250
know now a couple years later were we've

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,170
been 60 we've continued to succeed and

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,290
continue to grow or currently over 30

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:34,150
employees as I said and you know we've

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,900
got a great amount of potential ahead of

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,160
us so you know there's a lot of things

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,350
that are happening for us in the future

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,210
and I'm you know kind of involved in the

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,690
process going to revamp the company can

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,550
allow it to continue to grow there a lot

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,920
of challenges that we face as we've

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,810
grown from a one-person shop to a

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,430
five-person to ten to twenty to thirty

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,560
and we're going to have to change some

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,270
things up to make it to 50 or 100 in the

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,240
future so those are the kind of things

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,220
I'm looking at and I still I have the

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,750
energy and the excitement that I do now

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,820
about making those changes that I did

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,740
when I first rolled out that first

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,810
commercial products it's pretty exciting

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,950
a lot of things I've learned I like to

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,740
share with you because whether or not

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,510
you're starting you know you want to

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,460
start a company you want to start the

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,830
next Facebook or the next uber or

00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,210
whatever it is or maybe you just you

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,580
already have a business you have a

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,860
company maybe it's just a side gig they

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,070
do part time that you use it to support

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,070
yourself generate some extra income

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,120
hopefully something in here will be

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,220
informative to you you'll be able to

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,990
make use of it that will help inspire

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,260
you to take it to the next level if

00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,850
that's what you want to do so first I

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,070
want to talk about some things that I

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,690
think are important to entrepreneurs in

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,760
general how they think the way they work

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:52,000
so one of the really important things I

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,950
think is you need to you have a couple

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,710
key qualities that are really important

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,650
one is as an entrepreneur you need to be

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,990
willing to take risk and there are a

00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,480
couple types of risk there's risky

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,490
behavior which you want to avoid and

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,140
there's calculated risk so the

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,300
difference between the two is this if

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,440
you quit your job without knowing what

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,810
your next job is going to be that's

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,660
risky behavior you set yourself up on

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,160
the road to financial calamity but if

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,110
you quit your job because you already

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,330
have your next job or your next gig

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,160
lined up that's a calculated risk that

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,900
you can make and as an entrepreneur you

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
want to take calculated risks you don't

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,890
want to engage in a risky behavior

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,300
you also have to be willing to face up

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,450
to the fact that you are not always

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,330
going to succeed everybody wants

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,760
everything they do to be a smashing

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,410
success but that's now life everybody

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,720
has failures things don't work out like

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,640
you think they're going to but if you're

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,250
an entrepreneur what you need to do is

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,160
look at the failures and the setbacks

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,590
that you have I take the lessons from

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,780
those things and apply those things to

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,670
the future things that you do either in

00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,310
your existing company the way you work

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,080
on the next you know company effort

00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,610
whatever it is that you launch you need

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,980
to learn from your past mistakes don't

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,930
get don't get you know in a place where

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,010
you just feel like you've felt and you

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,930
don't want to start something new you

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,930
just if the pick yourself up and move

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,940
beyond that and grow as a person you

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,530
also have to be somebody who can get

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,300
things done on your own if you need

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,650
somebody else to motivate you you're not

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,350
really going to be good as a founder

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,930
because a day one unless you have a lot

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,280
of money and you can bring in a team of

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,030
people to do the stuff that you want to

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,770
do for you you've got to do yourself so

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,740
you have to be motivated to learn the

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,740
technology how to build the product how

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,680
to support a product how to sell how to

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,150
market how to provide support you might

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,220
be a specialist right now you might know

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,730
you might be a really good developer but

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,430
you might not know anything about

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,450
selling stuff or how to market and as an

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,610
entrepreneur you need to be able to

00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,170
figure that out and you need to take the

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,360
first steps you need to learn it's a

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,190
constant learning process there are

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,900
things I know now that I didn't know 12

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,630
13 years ago that i didn't know two

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,000
years ago but there are a lot of things

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,069
that i don't know right now i don't know

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,680
how to take the company to a point where

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,480
it's 500 employees or a thousand people

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,980
i don't know how to take it to a point

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,650
where we could launch an IPO because i

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,000
don't have the experience it's you

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,910
constantly have to learn as an

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,350
entrepreneur and you know everybody here

00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,360
your technical you've had to learn a lot

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,310
of stuff to get to where you are so that

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,470
that's not a new concept to you you just

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,040
gonna have to branch out and get get out

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,660
of the the tech box that you might be in

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,330
you also have to be somebody who knows

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,929
how to take all the ideas that you and

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,620
other people have I mean their ideas all

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,900
around us

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,900
everybody knows that but you have to be

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,520
able to take an idea and to say okay

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,950
what are the pros and cons of this idea

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,140
and to nurture that a little bit and say

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,880
okay what could I do with this or you

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,550
know what are the third what do I need

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,320
to be able to get there you have to open

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,990
it up to critical criticism you know and

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,280
let people you know hear about your idea

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,980
but you got to protect it at the same

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,130
time you have to be able to build that

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,100
idea into a vision into a goal and then

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,840
actually start working on and building

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,090
you know what you need to do to get to

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,740
that goal and it's also more that you're

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,450
Jack of many trades this gets back to

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,270
you need to do a lot of stuff when

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,100
you're small might it be just you it

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:27,670
might be you and one or two other people

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,230
but as a team or as just yourself you

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,270
have to do a lot of different things and

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,470
you've learned a lot of different things

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:38,110
so being flexible on that and being open

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,410
to learning things that you don't know

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,630
already is super important well I think

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,050
you guys in this audience would make

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,070
good entrepreneurs 1 i'm a tech and I

00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,990
feel like it'd make a good entrepreneur

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,770
so you guys are text I feel like you

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,929
guys went to so but you know text in

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,480
general I mean you guys are specialists

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,150
of some kind or either a web developer

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,460
your sis admin you're a network admin

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,610
you've got some specialty area that you

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,500
kind of focus on and you've learned a

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,350
lot to get there so you know a lot about

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,150
that market you are also intimately

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,700
aware of the things that you and your

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:17,620
co-workers wish you had in terms of

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,110
software services hardware or whatever

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,900
it might be so you've got your an

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,570
industry insider you know what kind of

00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,280
opportunities are available for services

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,350
for products that aren't available right

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,970
now so you got an inside look you know

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,580
what the opportunity is and you also

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:38,170
have the technical ability to build that

00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,790
and all you need to do is basically take

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,929
action like I said there's a lot of

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,550
things you might not know right now

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,250
that's okay you can learn that along the

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,870
way as long as you're willing if you

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,040
want to get started on something if you

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,270
haven't started something yet most

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,980
people how many people in here I've

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,110
actually started their own gig they've

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,890
got their own company or part time job

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,510
all right nice job

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,760
you know kudos to you because I know it

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:00,910
takes a lot of work to pull that off for

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,950
those of you that are interested in it

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:06,770
there's some things I've got as

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,080
recommendations I mean a lot of people

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,390
think about starting something new like

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,490
a new business they've got ideas but a

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,630
lot of times it comes down to self-doubt

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:19,190
they don't feel like they can do it they

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,830
don't think like it would work out but

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:25,160
but somebody told me that you know life

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,710
is is not chance its choice which means

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,900
if you want to do something you need to

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,210
make the choice to do it the where

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,490
you're at right now your skill set your

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,860
industry wherever you're at and life is

00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,600
a result of the choices you made up to

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,240
this point so if you want to be

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,190
someplace in five years ten years you

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,840
have to make a choice right now as to

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,740
what you need to do to actually get

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:51,160
there so one of the big things that I

00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,950
think is important to get started and to

00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,020
continue to to build your company your

00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,330
product or service whatever it is you

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,000
want to build is to get inspired and

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,920
stay inspired and obviously you're not

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,960
inspired the whole time there's mundane

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,780
boring work you got to do their setbacks

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,530
but getting inspired believing that you

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,600
can do it is is I think finally critical

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,930
to any kind of new endeavor you

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,280
undertake one of things that i did and i

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,400
would recommend is that you look at

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,730
successful companies what they did to

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,010
get started and how they launched

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,590
products successfully and look at their

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,260
failures too we all have examples of

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:36,970
companies that failed or product lines

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,320
that failed learn from what they did and

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,960
apply those things to yourself even

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,330
though you're not the scale of an IBM or

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,040
a Microsoft or Facebook you can take

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,940
some things they did and apply those

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,850
principles to whatever endeavor you're

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,320
you're going after I think it's really

00:21:52,850 --> 00:22:00,620
critical to listen to and read about the

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,160
early days of companies so I mean Google

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,390
is for example it's a it's a it's huge I

00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,760
mean it's I'm sure it's far

00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:11,630
seated the original vision of the

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,250
founders but on day one this is two guys

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:17,880
it was really small Facebook started out

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,710
of a dorm room you know the the Facebook

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,440
of today probably wasn't a head net

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,150
barks up Zuckerberg his mind on day one

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,340
when he launched it so you never know

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,580
what's going to happen but to get from

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,560
one person indoor dorm room to a company

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,840
the size of Dell you've got to do a

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,270
bunch of different things and the

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,280
decisions those those founders made in

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,080
the early days when they started the

00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,050
direction of the product or the

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,030
direction of the company was critical in

00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,220
determining whether that company and

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,530
those product lines would succeed or

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,480
fail so I think that's really critical

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,660
to pay attention to the early days

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,520
because if you mess up in the early days

00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,290
it can spell disaster you can make

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,870
mistakes when you're bigger you can have

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,570
a complete product line fail if you're

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,550
the size of IBM you can absorb that but

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,740
when it's just you or a couple people

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,050
you can't afford to make huge mistakes

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,730
you can make little mistakes calculated

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,760
risks is what you want to take you down

00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:17,040
to engage in risky behavior so you want

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,920
your mistakes to be as small as possible

00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,580
and you can contain those instead of

00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,680
having them just take you down these two

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,770
posters are actually framed in my office

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,050
at nagios I got you know I looked to the

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,450
tech industry for inspiration but I also

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,370
looked elsewhere I mean anything in you

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,710
know if I inspirational can help you

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:41,190
through I found you know I'm not I only

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,290
know like six songs from mm but when I

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,320
watched the the movie I was so inspired

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,690
it's like this guy he came from having

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,490
nothing nobody believed in him but he

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,370
built he believed in himself and he

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,470
built an incredible empire and to me

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,240
that's inspiring and that things like

00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,860
that can hopefully inspire you everybody

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,400
knows the story of rocky somebody who

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,910
overcome great odds to be someone great

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,740
obviously it's fiction but the real life

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:11,580
stories I think are specially the

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,580
important ones so these two movies about

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,800
the the start of Apple and the start of

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,930
facebook when I watch these I was a CAD

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,740
this is this is cool this is you know

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,140
it's a romance

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,540
sighs version of what happened back then

00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,059
but it still shows you that a guy in a

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,280
dorm room some guys in a garage can do

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:30,840
something that that other people would

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,150
have said you're crazy you could never

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,800
do it you didn't have the resources the

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,640
money the team and they made something

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,100
happen happen you know I was trying to

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,340
take a look I don't really watch movies

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,410
like these as a movie viewer I kind of

00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,200
put myself in them so if you see in the

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,380
jobs to movie the first three minutes of

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,130
that movie Steve Jobs is portrayed he's

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,800
walking in into the auditorium and he's

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,890
introducing his team at Apple to the

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,980
ipod which is about to revolutionize the

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,200
industry and I don't just watch that as

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,600
a movie goer I picture myself that I'm

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,300
there I'm actually in the auditorium I

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,250
am an employee of Apple I'm on the

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,850
designer engineering team for i'm steve

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:20,610
jobs and just its capture the excitement

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,250
of being there where you're about to do

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,170
something incredibly awesome even if

00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,120
what you're doing or what you want to do

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,610
isn't that same scale all you might want

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,980
you might want to do is it's sort of

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,500
part-time gig doing you know web

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,809
development or you know you're helping

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,970
people install their WordPress you know

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,830
sites or something but you can use

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,090
inspiration from different places to

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,400
help launch you and get you through the

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:46,080
tough times one of the one of the books

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
i would recommend for the tech industry

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,520
there's a book called the founders at

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,830
work great stories were the author

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,200
interviews the people actually started

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,650
some very great companies that we are

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,230
all familiar with so the early stories

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,059
of how paypal and yahoo got started and

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,820
the early decisions that were made i

00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,200
think are really inspiring to be honest

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,640
I never actually finished this whole

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,679
book I got about two thirds of the way

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,030
through and I was so inspired I was like

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,910
I'm gonna stop reading and I'm gonna

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:18,000
start building something so i highly

00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:20,429
recommend it as you need to get inspired

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,670
you also had mentioned this before you

00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:26,550
need to be able to take ideas figure out

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,600
which ones are viable and take those to

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,030
a place where you can actually start

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,740
building on them you got to be able to

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,809
open them them up to critical

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,730
you know criticism from other people but

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:39,280
you don't want other people to destroy

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,950
their ideas and crush your dreams it's a

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,809
fine line between getting that external

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,480
feedback and actually protecting your

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,070
idea and believing in yourself that you

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,970
can do it but you don't want to do

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,440
something that that's not viable so it's

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,570
kinda it's a tough balance there's not

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,620
an exact science of how to do it but you

00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,230
need to be able to figure out a way to

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,880
do that and then you need to be able to

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:03,190
take that idea to a place where you can

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,220
develop a vision for what you want to do

00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,990
with that I start to build goals and in

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,750
a business plan if you haven't started a

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,640
business before for texts you know don't

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,260
spend a ton of time building the

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,809
business plan I didn't know what I was

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,110
doing when I started you know my company

00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,940
in 2003 and you know leading up to two

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,740
thousand seven with nagios enterprises I

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,330
was like okay well you know best

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,700
practices say I need to have a business

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,870
plan I don't know how to write one I

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,210
don't know what one looks like I've

00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,750
never been interested in starting a

00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,760
company managing a company I started

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,410
write a lot about it I'm like cheese I

00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,150
don't want to spend you know all this

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,010
time writing a fifty or a hundred page

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,960
business plan that actually I'm just

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,150
kind of making up right now because it's

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,580
just me and how am I supposed to say

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:52,600
we're going to be this in 10 years you

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,490
can't do that I'd recommend you know if

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,200
you start out you need to have a rough

00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,730
plan of what you need all you need to do

00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,590
is figure out what is it you want to do

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:01,960
what you have right now in terms of

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,820
money people resources and the first

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,520
things that you need to get things out

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,610
the door to start to succeed you can

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,400
change your business goals the plan the

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,650
vision along the way nothing that you

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,970
start out today is going to be what you

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,559
think it's going to be five or ten years

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,380
on the line it's just not realistic

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:23,050
especially when you're starting out so

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,400
don't spend too much time on it need to

00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,800
have a plan but you need to start

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,630
working and building that thing you also

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:33,460
need to get over some some fears so as I

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,460
mentioned nobody wants what they you

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,210
know do to fail I didn't start you know

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,940
the company in college thinking that it

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:44,200
was going to fail I what it succeed so

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,470
you have to get over the

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,299
the possibility that something you do is

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,070
not going to work out a lot of people

00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:54,340
don't want to start something because

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,230
they're afraid of you know of what they

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,460
look like to the family or friends if

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,029
things don't work out you have to get

00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,620
past that fear everybody has failure you

00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:04,590
also potentially I have to do this you

00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,269
had to get over a fear of success

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,669
because success would chain would have

00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:11,260
changed where I was in life at the time

00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:13,570
where I was planning to do something on

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,919
my own and I had concerns about what

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,409
would people think about me if I

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,330
succeeded and I had to get over those

00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:21,340
figures of success so such as fears of

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:24,460
failure that you need to deal with its

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,289
fears of success as well you know I

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,179
mentioned your ability to take a risk

00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:32,110
your willingness to take risk is largely

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:34,960
based on how secure do you feel a good

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:39,130
example of this is financial freedom so

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,110
back in 2000-2001 I was you know feeling

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,980
the crushing weight of student loan debt

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,049
and credit card debt and I worked on the

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,570
side to generate money to get myself out

00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:52,210
of debt and to go myself up where I had

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,179
a couple months worth of reserve where I

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,850
could get to a point of security and I

00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:59,019
said now I can quit my day job and I can

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,970
start something new and I've got a

00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,100
certain amount of time that I can

00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,320
support myself to see if this thing's

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,779
going to work I was single at the time

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,510
so it was just me I knew that I could

00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:13,330
eat spaghetti or ramen or whatever it

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:16,389
took to actually stretch my money as far

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:18,789
as I could if if I was married if I had

00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:20,679
kids my risk tolerance at that point

00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,019
would have been different so your your

00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:27,490
risk tolerance and your willingness to

00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:31,000
take risk in the future is is obviously

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,820
depending on where you are in life and

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,100
it before you launch anything I wouldn't

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,870
suggest that you just say I'm going to

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,149
put my job and start something and then

00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,010
I'll learn how to do it i would highly

00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:44,679
suggest you start researching everything

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,889
you need to know about getting that

00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,840
thing that you want to do built designed

00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:52,330
ready to go before you actually leave

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,700
your place of security or your day job

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,639
whatever it is learn everything you can

00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,559
about business plans about how to sell

00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:04,139
market how to develop that product or

00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,249
solution that you want to do early days

00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:08,440
when you get started in something

00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:10,269
whether it's just you know you and you

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,039
just want to support yourself consult

00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,869
you know on a consulting thing you want

00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,529
to do you don't you be your own boss or

00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:19,089
you want to build something bigger

00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:21,999
you're probably not starting with a

00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:23,499
whole lot of money and this is the time

00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,349
money trade-off that I talked about I

00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:27,909
didn't I didn't have very much money

00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:29,649
when I started any of my businesses but

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:33,190
I had the time and I was willing to

00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:34,450
learn so you've got to do all the work

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,940
you've got to do a lot of hard work to

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,179
get your product/service whatever it is

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,190
launched and despite what society is

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,559
starting to say sometimes nobody owes

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,389
you anything you are not entitled to

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,119
anything if you want success in this

00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:50,440
life you have to reach out take the

00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,619
opportunities that are available to you

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,479
work your butt off to get there somebody

00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:58,289
told me a couple years ago they said

00:31:55,479 --> 00:32:02,649
you're lucky with the success of nagios

00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:04,929
it was luck and I said to them I said

00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:06,309
you know as they say luck is just the

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,009
intersection of opportunity in

00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:11,200
preparation nobody handed me a

00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:14,259
successful project nobody handed me a

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,479
successful business I had to do a lot of

00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:18,849
work to get it to where it is today and

00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:21,729
they get a launch I just saw an

00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:24,339
opportunity I saw a need for example to

00:32:21,729 --> 00:32:25,839
monitor networks and I said I'm going to

00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,429
do something i'm going to take action

00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,719
i'm going to learn how to do this i'm

00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:29,859
going to learn how to actually launch a

00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:32,529
company i'm going to learn the rules

00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:34,089
that you need to follow when you hire an

00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:35,919
employee and all the taxes and the

00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:37,749
regulations and all that stuff that you

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,209
got to go through when you actually

00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:42,609
start a company nobody nobody handed

00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:43,739
that to me it's just a lot of work so

00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:45,940
you have to be willing to do that work

00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:50,979
one thing that's really important i

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:52,229
think you know I've been a developer for

00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:54,909
a number of years so it's like I

00:32:52,229 --> 00:32:56,079
everybody wants the thing that they put

00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,029
out there to be the best that it

00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,429
possibly can be they want you know a

00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:02,919
bug-free perfect application with all

00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,109
the features on day one that's not

00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:08,529
realistic for any kind of product

00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:10,460
rollout and if you if that's your goal

00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,720
on day one

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,540
you're setting yourself up for failure

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,150
because you're taking too long to build

00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,110
your product and it might not be what

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,240
your customers want so I this is sort of

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,630
the Minimum Viable Product idea you you

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,170
build something a product a service that

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:31,460
just has enough features enough quality

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,170
enough of what your customers want to

00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,300
get it out the door and then it got to

00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:37,310
focus on how you sell that to them how

00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,930
you how you do the marketing you can

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,410
refine your product over time you can

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,510
improve it based on customer feedback

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:46,550
but you need to get just enough of a

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,110
working product out there you can use

00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,760
that concept I mean all the time whether

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,800
you're developing a marketing plan in

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,000
your company some people they want to

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,490
sit down and they want to create the

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,990
ultimate plan for what the next year is

00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,840
going to look like for marketing effort

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,910
or sales effort or the product roadmap

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,760
and realistically you'll spend a lot of

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,130
time planning not enough time doing and

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,640
actually testing your ideas a lot of

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,920
that plan is going to be wasted so don't

00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,840
wait for perfection just get something

00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,370
workable and get it out the door and

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,470
then you got to focus on how do you sell

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,780
it to people because you know the

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,730
purpose of aiding is you want to succeed

00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,160
in part of successes financial success

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,720
so you might not have experience in

00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,880
selling but you need to figure out how

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,540
you're going to sell that product of

00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,050
people I didn't know how to sell stuff I

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,180
used examples from other companies to to

00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,410
figure out how to do it how to get

00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:42,350
things rolling that's kind of what you

00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:44,450
need to do as a founder especially if

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,560
you're one person to person shop it's

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,080
really important if you want that

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,210
company to grow you need to document all

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,400
the important things that you do because

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,350
eventually if you succeed and you start

00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,420
to hire people people need to have

00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,160
things that they that they're assigned

00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,170
to do and there's some complicated

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,460
things sometimes in the organization

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,160
that need to get done in a very

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,690
predictable repeatable manner you need

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,690
to document all the important systems

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,250
obviously as text you know the value of

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,920
documentation of knowledge bases

00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,780
whatever it is that that that's don't

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,280
you need to apply that to a business and

00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,950
document all the important things how to

00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,470
take an order what is it you say to a

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,829
customer when they call up simple things

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:24,900
like that if you document

00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:27,869
important things makes it easier to hire

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,670
people on and grow your company in

00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:31,289
whatever you're working on you need to

00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,019
do this this is the minimum viable

00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:36,959
product concept again you take the

00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:41,309
shortest possible path to getting things

00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:42,630
done to success so what an example you

00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:44,279
know when I was getting Breton when I

00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,979
was building nagios exile which is our

00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:49,140
first commercial product in 2009 I was

00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,299
at the same time rebuilding the websites

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,599
I was deploying a support infrastructure

00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:56,519
figuring out okay what do I have never

00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,279
written and it would never have like a

00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:02,789
product feature sheet or a priceless she

00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:05,339
never had a reseller program I never had

00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:07,079
case studies to show companies who

00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:09,209
weren't familiar with nagios the value

00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,680
of it and why they should use it so one

00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,229
of the things i did i'm like i don't

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,519
have time to write a case study because

00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:15,660
i'm developing software and trying to

00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:17,640
get this thing out the door i need to

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,759
sell it so what I did is actually went

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,769
to I looked at what Oracle had on their

00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:25,259
website for case studies and I looked

00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:27,119
the PDFs that they had and I looked at

00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:28,559
the content that was in them I looked

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,719
how that content was laid out and I said

00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,819
okay this is what I want the case

00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,009
studies to look like for Nadia so we're

00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,920
gonna use this on day one I also had a

00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:40,619
challenge where I didn't have the time

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,699
to go out and actually do a real case

00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:43,799
study with somebody because that takes

00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,209
that takes somebody in you know

00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:46,979
corporations they want everything to be

00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:49,289
approved it's got to go through approval

00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:51,239
process and knew I didn't have the time

00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:53,279
to wait for approval to get a case study

00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,109
back but I knew what I had was I had

00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,549
some testimonials from nagios user sayin

00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:58,920
hey we love nagios it's doing a great

00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:01,469
job for us so I reached out to a couple

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,809
of those people and I said let's do a

00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,269
success story let's not call it a case

00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:08,549
study let's call it a success story

00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:10,199
because maybe that will bypass some of

00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:11,789
the corporate approval that's required

00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:14,180
to actually get this thing published and

00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:16,499
that actually worked and because the

00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,509
their corporate manager said I'll kids

00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:20,430
on a case study sure it's more like a

00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:22,319
testimonial all of a sudden I had

00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:26,849
success stories that I get that I could

00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:28,680
use for you know basically purposes of

00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,449
selling people who came to us and said

00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,190
hey we just heard about nagas we knew

00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:35,069
nothing about what can I do for us I

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,950
could give them that success story that

00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:38,410
showed them that

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:40,150
bank or some other kind of enterprise

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,800
you know organization used it

00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,860
successfully to save money time and

00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,620
improve things so that was a short path

00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,830
to success in getting a case study done

00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,450
that's one example of that this is uh i

00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,400
thought i'd share this this this is a

00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,810
motivational poster this is how i look

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,550
as motivational i bought this a couple

00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:01,690
years ago you can actually get these

00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:03,820
from startup vitamins calm to me this it

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,510
says you're here for a purpose you're

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,980
here for a reason you know we are we're

00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,510
working together towards something so we

00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,310
don't have a lot of time we're always

00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,290
strapped for resources let's make the

00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,960
most of our time here do the best job we

00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,220
can and make things happen in order you

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,720
know Apple have the tagline you know

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,540
make it happen in order to make it

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,210
happen need to get stuff done this so

00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,310
this is just one you know things like

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,470
this can kind of make start-up

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,090
environment a little bit of fun a book I

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,470
would really highly recommend for

00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,540
anybody looking at starting something is

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,250
a book called work the system I picked

00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,180
this up because of the tagline I thought

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,740
it was great i'm like the simple

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:42,300
mechanics of making more and working

00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:45,550
less than like whoo i want that to be me

00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,830
first half of this book is about I

00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:49,390
almost stopped reading because half the

00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,100
first half of the book is all about how

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,850
do you set your business up to to work

00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,500
like a franchise like a McDonald's and I

00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,270
was like okay I'm not I'm starting us

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,100
off for a company I don't franchise

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,660
software companies like they do fast

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,310
food restaurants this doesn't apply to

00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:08,860
me but if you continue reading the

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:11,080
author base the whole purpose of the

00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,090
book and the concepts behind franchises

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,460
is they document everything that's super

00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,590
critical you know one thing if you think

00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,420
when you go to McDonald's anywhere in

00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,190
the US and you order number one combo

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,470
you always get the same thing and you

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,270
get it fast so there's consistency and

00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,920
there's efficiency some would say

00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,570
there's quality to I think that's you

00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,190
know we can argue that but you always

00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:35,470
get consistency and efficiency right and

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:38,050
so those are some those are some key

00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:40,600
things in thinking about a business and

00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,280
how to design a business like a system

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,960
like a network like an application

00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,130
because there are a lot of similarities

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,720
even though you might not think about it

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,010
right now there are a lot of

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,370
similarities in the way business works

00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:55,880
as to how a system works an application

00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,770
and network whatever it is a whole

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,320
concept of this is take the critical

00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,000
processes in your business and document

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,980
them so one of the things that we need

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,540
that we do in nagios and somebody buys

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,760
one of our products there about ten

00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:10,130
steps that need to be handled you know

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,650
license keys get generated stuff gets

00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,510
entered in the accounting system an

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,850
email gets sent to the customer they get

00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,430
access to a support forum whatever it is

00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:22,070
they're about ten critical steps and

00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,570
early on I'm like okay I'm doing this

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,450
right now but I need to hire somebody to

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,920
basically take over order fulfillment so

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,480
I'm going to document every single step

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,430
everything that's required to get

00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,290
through you know the whole process done

00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,150
and that we can use that to hire people

00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,970
and we've been able to bring on people

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,970
to do that job and that ends this very

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,740
easily because everything is documented

00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,880
two or three years ago I've I don't know

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,000
people must have been out of the office

00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,770
and I actually had to take and handle an

00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,180
order and I'm like i haven't had to do

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,550
this in like four or five years I don't

00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,260
even remember how to do it but I opened

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,300
the procedure sheet the process

00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,760
documentation and I was like I stuff

00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,410
won't do done I can do it so that's it's

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,800
all about making your business efficient

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:05,510
at something I'd recommend as you start

00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,510
to get bigger obviously it's you know

00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,920
hiring the right people is just it's so

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,430
hard to do we have an awesome team in

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,110
nagios you know they always say like how

00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:18,680
your slow fire fast it's not the way it

00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,940
works in reality because you know when

00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,470
you're looking to hire somebody it's

00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,320
because you have a need you're excited

00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,580
when Sony on the team and anyone to get

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,110
that position filled and know when

00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,280
things don't go right with somebody

00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,470
generally you want to give them another

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,140
chance you want to allow them to you

00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:35,660
know get better but it's really critical

00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,980
to try to hire the right people and if

00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,070
you're starting something out be

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,590
involved in the hiring process there I

00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:45,290
think we've only hired or interviewed

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,330
two people when I was out of the office

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,190
and I wasn't there in their interviews

00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,110
but every other person every position

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,300
that we've interviewed I've been there

00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:56,480
in the interview I've asked them the

00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,620
applicant questions like it's really

00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,910
critical because if you're the founder

00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,010
if you started something you have a

00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,750
vision for where you want the company to

00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,640
go or the endeavor to go whatever it is

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,220
you want to really know what the people

00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,070
have in terms of skills and also the way

00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,480
they think to make sure you get in the

00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,250
best people it's really interesting

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,990
sometimes people will apply for a

00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:19,470
specific position in our company like

00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:21,210
marketing or sales and I'll be you know

00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,070
talking with them in the interview I'm

00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,990
I'm like all right you're really not

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,380
right for sales or marketing or support

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,790
but you'd be really great over here or

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,990
you know you've got a skill set that we

00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,630
hadn't even thought we needed but we're

00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,130
going to hire you because that's what's

00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,430
going to help take us to the next level

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,590
so be involved in that there gonna be

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,080
some problems challenges that you run

00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,310
into when you know as a company grows if

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,620
that's what you want to do and if it's

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,870
successful obviously it's you know

00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,250
communication and a company with five

00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,110
people is super easy because you're in

00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,000
the same room and you're like hey you

00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:56,520
know can you help me get this done can

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,560
you take care of this when you're 20 or

00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,270
30 people gets more difficult one of the

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,820
things we had to do to help with scaling

00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:05,190
issues know a year ago we rolled out

00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,440
HipChat internally because you know our

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,420
support our dev teams were you know

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,760
separated now we have a bigger office

00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,080
space and you know the sales and

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,950
marketing team are in a whole different

00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:19,200
wing and so communication was an issue

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,550
and so that's why we roll out HipChat

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,310
that's one of the things we had to do to

00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,660
help us scale you know as we grow right

00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,820
now we're at a point where we're coming

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,470
up we've relied on distinct teams in the

00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,200
past where we have a distinct sales and

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,790
marketing team devon and support but now

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
we're kind of moving towards more work

00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,570
groups wear something you know there's a

00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,610
group that focuses on a particular area

00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,760
where weather its product development or

00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:43,380
roadmaps or a marketing you know efforts

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,880
that's one of things we're changing up

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,690
in order to be able to grow to the next

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,770
stage to get 250 people for example

00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,180
communication is a huge thing actually I

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,180
mentioned the sukkah chat but it's a

00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,010
huge thing as you continue to grow we're

00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,780
all people i mean people we all have

00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,530
issues I have issues you have issues if

00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,540
it has issues communication and people

00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,530
stuff is hugely important in any company

00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,030
especially when you're getting smooth

00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:08,250
you're small and you're getting started

00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:10,530
at some point hopefully whatever it is

00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,840
you've started gets to a point where

00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,420
it's successful and they're different

00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,640
measurements for success what

00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,799
measurement is you're generating some

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,630
extra side income or you're able to

00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:22,579
support yourself full time you were able

00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,700
to quit your day job and do your own

00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,930
thing or you hit a certain financial

00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,700
benchmark or revenue benchmark like we

00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,010
had a million dollars in 2010 that was a

00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,260
benchmark of success for us whatever

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,369
that level of success is you have to

00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,049
judge that for yourself and their

00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:38,630
multiple you know points where you feel

00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:43,040
like okay we met the next the next the

00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:44,990
next level of success but when you get

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,460
to that point at some point you end up

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,990
an issue with an issue if you're the

00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,170
founder of something I've had to go

00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,240
through this myself at one point or

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,780
another you have to do most of the

00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,790
things that you did on day one because

00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:01,220
it was only you or maybe one or two

00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,890
other people at some point you gotten to

00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,480
the point where you've hired people

00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,859
brought them on staff and they're kind

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,930
of doing all the things that used to do

00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:11,030
so you might get to a point where you're

00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,160
like okay what is my purpose here I

00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,660
don't actually I don't take care of the

00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,880
systems anymore I don't do development

00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,780
anymore not involved in support for

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,730
development whatever it is in you get

00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,160
into this thing it's like well you know

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:27,829
what should i do the thing that a

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,280
founder is is you're the architect you

00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:33,530
have the vision you know you've got an

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,200
idea of what you want your company to be

00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:38,420
and so you you have to move into working

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,059
on the company not in the company doing

00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,710
development doing support I still do

00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:44,000
that stuff it's fun to actually get my

00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,220
hands on different stuff and do

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,500
development or do marketing I think

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,930
that's fun but it's importantly work on

00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,849
the company figuring out how should the

00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,710
company restructure how do teams work

00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:57,109
together how do you get things done the

00:45:54,710 --> 00:46:00,530
most efficient manner so you're the

00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:02,599
architect with the vision there's a lot

00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:05,540
of stuff that can go wrong in any new

00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:09,170
endeavor everybody you know everybody

00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:11,299
has setbacks in life or in businesses

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,880
that they start so you know things go

00:46:11,299 --> 00:46:18,020
wrong we all know that there's a lot of

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,400
challenges here there are too many to

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,170
actually talk about their too many great

00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,940
things to to talk about being an

00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:25,460
entrepreneur to me is the most

00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,970
challenging and the most rewarding thing

00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,310
I've ever

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:30,619
I didn't think I could do it I wanted to

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:32,330
do it you know even back in college but

00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,830
part of me felt like I couldn't do it

00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,780
but I was eventually able to get over

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,520
that and start doing things you know

00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:39,800
plenty of these moments where you're

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,630
just like what was I thinking why did I

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,599
say that why do we launch this product

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:47,840
why did you know why did things go this

00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:49,130
way or that way you just gotta you just

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,640
gotta move beyond that you just have to

00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,170
learn from from experience and just

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,260
continue to improve just like everybody

00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:59,720
does or talk about open source and

00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:04,099
entrepreneur ism since this is the Linux

00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:06,380
festival conference there's a lot of

00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:08,510
huge potential in open source one is a

00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,520
lot of companies we do this too we

00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,990
leverage open sources are stack I'm not

00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,270
talking about a lamp stack I'm talking

00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,460
to a stack in general because you might

00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,650
roll out a service or solution of some

00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,240
kind that utilizes the underlying

00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,480
components in open source you guys know

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,599
how easy it is to leverage to customize

00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,580
whether it's the the operating system

00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:30,290
the applications the programming

00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:31,880
language is whatever it is you can use

00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:32,869
all those components as your stack when

00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,180
you're building your product your

00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:37,190
solution whatever it is we actually in

00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,869
nagios we utilize an open core model for

00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,820
our business so we've got a commercial

00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:44,030
front end and capabilities that are

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,960
built on top of open source components

00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,180
underneath the hood one of the

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,160
components we use is nagios core the

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,660
same thing that you know is available to

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,420
the open source community we have a lot

00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:55,070
of open source stuff underneath the hood

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,359
and a lot of glue that that makes

00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:58,310
everything work together but that's

00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:02,030
that's a model you can use you can build

00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:05,240
a product around open source if you are

00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:07,310
a lead developer of an open open source

00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,780
project there are a lot of options are

00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,450
available to you this is where this is

00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,900
where I came from if you know if you

00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,800
started something an open source and

00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,960
you've got a project that you're

00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,420
maintaining you are an entrepreneur you

00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,640
haven't you know generated any money yet

00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,210
but you took a risk you put the time in

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,240
you have a product out on the market and

00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:30,560
your clients your customers are the

00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,540
people using it right now they just

00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,690
haven't paid you for it yet and they

00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,849
might not ever buy anything from you but

00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,530
you proven a product in the market

00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:41,599
you've proven that somebody wants that

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:44,030
widget that application that you built

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,119
so if you're in the position you have a

00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:49,130
lot of advantages to you that the people

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,440
that use your product they're your

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,420
initial you know the early adopters of

00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,240
the people that not only help to improve

00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,310
that you know your your project but

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,050
they're potentially your initial market

00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:03,260
to if you can offer them something more

00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:05,540
maybe a commercial add-on or services

00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,369
around your project i started out this

00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,410
way offering consulting and support

00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:12,200
around I guess bar didn't have a product

00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,780
that I had built on top of it so you can

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,819
do that as well so a lot of options for

00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,910
open source people even if you're if

00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:21,349
you're not a project lead if you know if

00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,510
you're a developer and you're really

00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,550
familiar with wordpress you can start a

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,560
side gig offering commercial WordPress

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,300
add-ons for example and that's how you

00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,770
can get your start you can generate some

00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,950
revenue on the side and get started and

00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:36,589
maybe eventually launch a full blown you

00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,700
know web dev shop down the road so you

00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:40,130
never know where things are going to go

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,500
some key things that I would recommend

00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,599
you should ask before you build the

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,160
ultimate product you know you don't want

00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:48,230
to build something nobody wants I made

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,270
this mistake before and one of the

00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,280
companies i started i thought i was

00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:54,109
building something awesome I didn't ask

00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,790
for input i built the wrong thing that

00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,230
wasn't a market for it or it was at the

00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,329
wrong time or i didn't know how to sell

00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:03,079
or market whatever it was it didn't work

00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:04,640
out but a big key I think to previous

00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,270
failures as I didn't ask what people

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:11,990
wanted and for nagios when we launched

00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:13,910
nog esxi I took all the suggestions and

00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:16,190
the wish list essentially from my

00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:19,220
consulting clients ask them what they

00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:21,950
wanted in a commercial solution and I

00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:24,680
put all those things into our commercial

00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:25,970
product and actually it saved money for

00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:30,380
people like that who were coming to me

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:32,030
for consulting because you know they'd

00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,579
hired me for consultants if we want a

00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:36,290
better UI we want easier config and I

00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:37,490
install different you know components

00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,560
for them and set it up and it's like

00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:42,319
they get the consulting bill it actually

00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,780
costs more than what we sold our product

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,849
for we actually launched our product the

00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,119
first version because I was like scared

00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:50,829
I'm like I need to start selling its guy

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,079
to sell to prove to me that somebody

00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:55,329
wants it we sold it for under five

00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:56,799
hundred dollars it perpetual license and

00:50:55,329 --> 00:50:58,839
you got a year's worth the support and I

00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:00,309
was the only guy supporting it but I was

00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:02,349
like okay we can sell for five hundred

00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:04,240
dollars competing solutions in the

00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:06,309
market go for five to ten thousand or

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,519
more I'm just going to get out the door

00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:11,380
and do something focus obviously you got

00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,960
it you got to sell it otherwise it's not

00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,910
viable one of the things that's

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,799
important to emulate the successful

00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,539
companies i mentioned that i use oracle

00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:21,700
as example for case studies but i also

00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:23,230
looked at you know I didn't our

00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,970
commercial software doesn't have an open

00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,769
source licence it's a proprietary

00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,630
license I didn't know how to write one

00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:30,940
so i looked at the licenses in the

00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,980
agreements from apple and Dell and i

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,380
said okay these are really good good

00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:37,720
ideas for what should go into a

00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,119
commercial license and I employed those

00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,559
things in in a license a short circuited

00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,019
a lot of a lot of work that I otherwise

00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:46,839
what I have to do myself by just looking

00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:48,279
at highly successful companies and as I

00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:50,950
mentioned you don't need to do something

00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:53,140
that's the next Facebook it can be

00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:54,640
something small start part-time don't

00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,039
quit your day job without having your

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,589
next gig lined up and you can you can do

00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,410
it part time it's really important to to

00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:05,440
get started slow just overall just to

00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,359
know what's possible and a lot of the

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,920
successes in life that we see that we

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,170
take for granted took an incredible

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,849
amount of courage to actually launch and

00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,249
a ton of work to actually bring it to

00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:18,880
you or it's actually a viable product or

00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:19,930
solution it's incredibly it's awesome

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,180
when you see companies like SpaceX

00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:25,779
launch a rocket whether that rocket

00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:28,420
crashes or takes off but just you know

00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:30,009
you think about the at some point I mean

00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,869
didn't have rockets and stuff sittin

00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:33,640
around there actually a few people

00:52:31,869 --> 00:52:35,769
probably sitting around a table going we

00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,140
should start a space company that's not

00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:41,940
a small endeavor but they managed to get

00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:45,549
there there's a dell came out with an ad

00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,900
commercial about two years ago that I

00:52:45,549 --> 00:52:49,329
thought when I saw them like this is so

00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,369
inspiring this captures the the essence

00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:54,369
of what it feels like to be able to look

00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:57,910
back and and know that something really

00:52:54,369 --> 00:53:01,210
cool was started basically from nothing

00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,410
and I want to play it for you here it's

00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,819
probably doesn't constant

00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,890
to fair use but I'm going to say it's

00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:08,920
educational because it's it's a good

00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:11,500
example of good marketing but it

00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,390
inspires me and it just it's great

00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,700
example if you can go from an idea or

00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:18,280
working in the basement working the dorm

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,079
room working on the garage and build

00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,940
something really cool so I'm going to

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,240
play that hopefully the audio will work

00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,240
here

00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:30,150
whatever I see that out I'm like yeah

00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,380
that's that's what it feels like and you

00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:32,970
know I mean it's a good example of

00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,160
brilliant marketing on part Adele

00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:38,010
they're like hey we came from nothing we

00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,380
came from a dorm room and now with this

00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,760
huge company and you know I watched this

00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,160
and like you know I'm like yeah we can

00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,830
do this and I actually use stuff like

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,660
this or other you know other movies or

00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,400
whatever it is to get inspired not only

00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,440
one I'm starting something new but when

00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,750
what I've got gotten to a point where

00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,510
it's like okay we need to revamp rework

00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,580
things and do something new and stuff

00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:01,890
like this the inspiration for doing

00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,630
something can come from anywhere it just

00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,450
helps you launch and get to where you

00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:09,030
want to go you know as I mentioned

00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:11,280
before life is it's not chances choices

00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:13,020
you have to determine your destiny what

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,430
you want to work on it everybody wants

00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,200
to start something new now everybody

00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:17,160
wants to be an entrepreneur that's okay

00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,730
but if you do if you've been thinking

00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,710
about it seriously consider it I know

00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:25,170
there's a lot of work and a lot of worry

00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,820
that goes into okay how do I leave the

00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,460
financial security of where I'm at right

00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:31,260
now and do something new but the way I

00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,480
kind of look at it is you know when I'm

00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,330
80 or 90 years old and I'm looking back

00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,550
at my life what do I want to say that I

00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,040
accomplished her that I tried do I want

00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,230
to say I wish I had done this I wish I

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,500
had tried to launch a company tried to

00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:48,870
do whatever travel whatever it is or am

00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,270
I glad that I tried it some things I

00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:54,360
tried worked some things were successes

00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:56,280
something's failed I would rather have

00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,890
taken the chance in the opportunity to

00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,420
do different things so anyway I hope you

00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,920
find something useful in that whether

00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,500
you are interested in starting something

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,990
new you know changing up what you're

00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,420
currently doing if you have a company if

00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,220
you're self-employed if you are thinking

00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,260
about starting something one last tip do

00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,660
not go as a sole proprietorship do a

00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,180
corporation or an LLC all the seas are

00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:19,560
