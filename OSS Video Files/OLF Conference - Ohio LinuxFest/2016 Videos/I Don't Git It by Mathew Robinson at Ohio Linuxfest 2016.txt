	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
doesn't talk about give even hear you

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,589

robinson i do jobs for the burger

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,400
company which is like code from

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,960
overworking on the baby we're going to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,150
link some awesome 2 g's for 12 years i

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,880
installed into and I was like 13 and ran

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,340
out get installing hacker now is cool so

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
that's how I got started I'm also

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:44,370
podcaster and certain developer on

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:48,680
weekends so um but you much yeah don't

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,680
Google that though that it's not good

00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,829
once you would see the results come but

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,030
I'm assuming like raise your hand if you

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,789
don't want to contribute open source

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,280
software in this room right alright cool

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,489
that's be good so the thing I would say

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,810
is just do it right always always always

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,220
it every single one of these linux best

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,080
I've ever been to there's always the

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,490
talk that's like yeah everyone should

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,380
get pumped nur what you contributed you

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,790
do you feel you know you can do whatever

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,049
right you don't need a hug code there's

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,070
all this stuff you can do talk entation

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,200
or whatever and I always go to those and

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,330
I always get super duper poem for a like

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,890
I am just like ready to go after that

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,630
and I walk out of the room only yeah I'm

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,210
going to contribute to open source but

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,100
then I realized that a couple years ago

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,479
I didn't know where to start I got kind

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,460
of stuck I walked out the room and had

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,520
nowhere to put all that energy so just

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,829
kind of died off um so this talk sex

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,579
going to be about get and that's because

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,100
even though we do a lot of different

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,450
technologies and open source get this

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,189
the only one that's like used everywhere

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,670
right it's the most viewed as tool we

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,350
have you know if you if you want to work

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,590
on the linux kernel or whatever indian

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,850
ocean scene and hardware code or

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,049
right but you're going to write a Python

00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,909
command line so well it's a totally

00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,990
different skill set right but either one

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,329
of those things you're going to be using

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,979
get no matter what I mean even C Python

00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,210
all these products that were on other

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,679
version control systems and now pretty

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,390
much moved to get for the most part and

00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:11,330
github so it's we're going to focus on

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,840
now but uh that's why I like if you want

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,739
to do this you need to know get so some

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,269
of you might be wondering though

00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:19,610
obviously the majority of you will not

00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,739
be what does get well it's a

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,129
distribution control system manage teams

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,849
files over time it's very complicated

00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,560
and it doesn't remote mobile

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,569
repositories which is different which

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,010
only really matters in context of

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,840
preparing it to a previous version

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,290
control system so it could use

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,450
subversion yet how many be able Mike

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:44,120
subversion yeah all right cool yeah so

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,440
if there's a broom from resources okay

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,670
fair enough yeah I would say that's

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,980
another great I would say that's an

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,220
upgrade so in program we just moved

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,360
everyone to get from submersion and for

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,250
whatever reason the people work at

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,170
kroger really like subversion so they

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,620
were really not happy with me so my job

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,850
is to make that like to get now if I

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,139
settle these words and you have no

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,970
understanding what they mean it sounds

00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,220
like alphabet soup to you and that's how

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,400
you feel right now don't worry I'm going

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,780
to take you through the very very basics

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,560
fun metals that you need to actually use

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,019
get properly and not you know what my

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,980
favorite speaker says that getting

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,359
powers you to seamlessly square of your

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,180
co-workers and we're going to teach you

00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,609
how to not do that so this slide is

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,079
mostly a reference slide so if you were

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,370
wanting to take a picture of a slide

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,989
this would be the one to take a picture

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,700
of these are the commands that you're

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,220
going to run every single day that you

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,840
use get if you understand all these

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,230
commands and like at least what they do

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,549
and how they work you really don't get

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,829
and you can google your way through any

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,450
problem kind of the trick to getting

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,859
started with get is that to understand

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,079
all these you kind of need context of

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,639
what the other things do and then to get

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,290
to the more complicated stuff it always

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,609
shows up when you're like Google how to

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,660
fix this get problem it's always like

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,950
you should rebase some was like you

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,150
should cherry pick someone's like you

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,919
should do emerge and then fix it in

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,300
place there's like I don't know what any

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,970
of those

00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,530
mean so that's what we it's really

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,970
difficult and so these are the commands

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,200
like if you understand these you can

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,370
figure out what a cherry pick notes you

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,270
can figure out what are you basing is

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,220
you can figure out all the different

00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,990
stuff right you can figure out squash

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,190
things so we're gonna going to start I'm

00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,630
actually gonna take you through like

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,680
basically we're going to go through

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,940
these in the order that you would use

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,410
them as if you were contributing to a

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,640
project might tell you a story and then

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,230
we're going to demo and actually

00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,930
contribute to an open source project on

00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:28,720
stage and by me i mean so so is there

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,560
any mac users in the crowd are out

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,570
really sorry um so let's imagine for a

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
second did you decide that you want to

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,590
contribute to fin right fins on github

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,540
so what you do is you got to the van

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,270
repo on github you go there you click

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,030
the fourth button and then you'll have

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,830
your own copy of the vehm repo on your

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,930
github account and it'll say like your

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,000
username them instead of them them right

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,140
well first thing you gotta do is to get

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,490
that source code actually work on is

00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,350
you've got a clone it and the reason we

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,910
call it kelowna not download is because

00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,320
it literally makes a copy of the repo

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,530
that's what I'm gonna talk about being

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,570
distributed right everything is a remote

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,460
even your local rap laptop the remote is

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,690
a repo everything's basically identical

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,890
for all intents and purposes um so just

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,300
like the example there you would go

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,500
ahead and clone down your Reba once you

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,580
do that you'll have a folder leave them

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,830
and it'll have all the Memphis source

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,690
code in there and so once you see the

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,919
end of that directory right the first

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,200
thing you're going to want to do is run

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,540
get stats get status in my favorite

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,310
command um if you only remember one of

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,200
them that's the one to remember because

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,430
it's your spirit guide right it's going

00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,919
to hold your hand to take you on the

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,450
journey that is using it because often

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,970
it won't even tell you exactly what you

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,090
need to do to progress further through

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,090
using it right so if it'll show you

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,430
unstaged changes let's teach files

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,390
untracked files right and once you stage

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,010
those things will tell you that their

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,210
stage and it will say hey you know

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,280
you've got these changes to be committed

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,590
so obviously if it needs to be committed

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,880
you should run git commit worries talk

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,310
about what like the rest of that means

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,540
in a second but get status is awesome so

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:04,140
you get status but

00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,610
once you once you get in there right and

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,700
let's say for instance that you want to

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,960
get up I don't know what I'm going to do

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,490
then we're going to go ahead and add an

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,440
e Lisp interpreter right that seems like

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,350
a good thing to do now my emacs convey

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,400
works a month them too perfect so what

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,930
we're going to do is we're going to make

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,620
some changes to the source files and

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,080
once we do that we're going to stage

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,850
those changes so let's say we go ahead

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,740
and we add a new file called like Ellis

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,470
see that sounds like really good file

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,150
name so once you do that you've got to

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,920
say you run git status and it's red and

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,510
says hey you've got this untracked file

00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,670
well make that file be tracked you

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,060
didn't stage it and the best way to

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,770
explain this in my opinion is you have

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,450
like a stack of boxes right and you need

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,340
to load them on a trunk and the best way

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,680
to do that is like let's say that only

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,510
some of these need to go on time you

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,550
move some of those boxes into a staging

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,960
area and then at some point someone will

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,580
come along and take those boxes in the

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,310
staging area and put them in the truck

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,740
right staging them is the git add

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,150
command taking them from the staging

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,740
area and putting them on the truck

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,390
putting a little bow on it and all that

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,380
getting it ready to ship that's

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,910
committing it right so it sounds hard

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,710
but what it is at the end of the day

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,770
with a git commit is it'll take those

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,140
changes throw them into this mystical

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,140
database that get controls and I have no

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,390
understanding of um and it puts a git

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,000
log message in there and it says these

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,950
are the changes I made right and then

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,960
here is the hash that points to the

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,970
point in time that I made those changes

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,440
right so if you talking things like the

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,790
date or whatever and what's really nice

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,010
about that is it makes it easy to go

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,080
back to this changes and to revert those

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:45,900
changes ok um right in commit messages

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,790
is sometimes really hard it will open up

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,680
the editor which is why by default which

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:53,460
for the United people is awful and you

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,930
can set that but a gift commit message

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,720
is generally going to be a 50 character

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,600
summary right and then there's a part

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,300
for you to put like a

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,750
your form description but again commit

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,920
should always be very clear about what

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,630
you did and generally speaking this

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,260
should be pretty small and that's just

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,310
general good get stuff but the thing you

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,420
might notice is is that we haven't

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,430
actually made a branch or any of this

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,870
stuff we have no way to keep our changes

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,550
separate from other changes so if you

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,980
went ahead major eel is an inverter

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,990
right and then you were like oh I might

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,270
need to update the version number or

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,120
something or I need to add the readme or

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,550
document my new thing right now that's

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,169
not all necessarily related and so

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,120
you'll want to do is you actually want

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,430
to use a branch and a branch is just a

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,590
way to kind of encapsulate that work as

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,320
being separate from the rest of your

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,690
changes okay so if I go in there and

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,460
make an EOS interpreter right but I also

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,650
want to add a new vin script function so

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,750
that you can like do in line nealis with

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,520
a pin script that's not necessarily

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,170
related so you want to keep this change

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,180
is separate and the reason that this is

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,230
like really really important is is how

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,880
many people have like ever had your

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,160
manager like email you a spreadsheet

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,190
like to your entire team have lasted out

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,690
and has like five rows and each row

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,860
represents one person on the team and he

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,020
says hey I need you to fill this out for

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,670
you and then everyone fills out their

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,040
Road and emails him back that same

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,570
spreadsheet yeah I see some heads

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,070
nodding okay this has me a lot what's

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,750
awful about that is once he gets all

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,820
those back right he has to open up his

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,450
spreadsheet and then copy and paste and

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,760
do this all super manually right what

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,350
would be much easier is for him to say

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,200
okay here's just git repo with a

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,480
spreadsheet everyone clone it down make

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,000
a branch for your change right so I

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,010
would make a matte branch right and then

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,190
I've make my changes and I push my mat

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,350
branch up once once he has that he can

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,810
pull that down and once he does that he

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,210
can then merge my branch in and get will

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,850
take care of making sure that they play

00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,320
nice right so since losses they'll take

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,570
my changes to play on top of his version

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,490
of the file so once he does that he then

00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,290
has his spreadsheet with my changes on

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,530
it and you have to do anything except

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:06,490
just let do get cool right everything

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:09,040
just kind of worked um but what you do

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,779
that is with git branch man which allows

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,819
you to view

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:14,490
create manage branches right delete them

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,709
etc and then the checkout come in so if

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,720
you went into your memory boat and you

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:22,439
said are I want to make git branch right

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,269
you listen interpreter right you'll

00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,970
notice if you run git status fo you lose

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,259
you're still on the master branch um

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,230
don't ever make changes to someone's

00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,819
master wrench right like who's our a

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,069
passenger like change the radio station

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:37,680
while you're driving that's that's

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:40,920
that's likely analogous equivalent right

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,110
you just don't do it it's not nice so

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,089
you've got to check out the branch I put

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,059
into useful fly here that man there just

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,279
does both those things in one go so but

00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,139
the best way that to think about

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,209
branches right because it's weird to see

00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:56,309
how that kind of works in your head with

00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,279
if you never see anything like that so

00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:01,670
we have these beautiful charts and it

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,959
looked kind of like at our hero um

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,970
you'll notice they're like at a certain

00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,550
point right let's say that purple brains

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,959
right off the bottom someone decided to

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,170
make a branch and that's why it shoots

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,550
up into its own thing what's what's

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,649
important to remember is that when they

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,860
do that the changes continued to happen

00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:23,519
on that bottom purple branch okay they

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,250
don't have that work in their branch so

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,079
when they go to merge sometimes you'll

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,879
have a really bad time and we're going

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,629
to talk about madness later but

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:35,129
basically there's a lot of ways around

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,569
that and that's why i get is hard

00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,449
because it gives you all these ways to

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,800
get out of these tight spots but what

00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,959
would happen is once you create that

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,329
branch right no one else has that it's

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,870
all local so then you've got to make a

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:52,339
changes etc and once you commit them all

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:55,050
you then have to push your workout so

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,790
the the super simple way that subversion

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,439
used to work right is there was the

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,290
rebound server you checked it out a

00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:03,389
major change to check back at right with

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,069
kids it's a little different so what you

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,779
do is you have your own version of that

00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:08,550
repo and now that you've made these

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,259
changes you made these branches you done

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:14,879
all this like wonderful terrible things

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:17,459
um you've got all this but no one else

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,559
does so

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,029
if you have to push those changes up so

00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:23,579
what that does is that takes the Delta

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,110
of your local repo and then and what

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,559
they have up there the dull so between

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,920
those two and just pushes that piece to

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,369
them right so new branches new changes

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,279
all that stuff up there now once that's

00:12:35,369 --> 00:12:40,439
happened then let's say your bro over

00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,389
there it was like a hardware emx guy and

00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:44,850
you want him to try your new vin bill

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,100
that does stuff and he's like okay cool

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,249
so he has to pull your changes down

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,449
right push and pull arkham like they're

00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:54,029
just the opposite to each other by

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:56,759
identical in every way except that when

00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:59,699
you push to something right if that's

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:01,829
something that remote repo does it has

00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:03,809
changes that you do not have the push

00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,869
will fail and then you'll have to pull

00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:08,720
those changes first so as long as you

00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,860
have stuff they don't have you can push

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,529
otherwise you have to get their stuff

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,779
first and then add your stuff to it okay

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,850
now the cool thing is is that pool

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,149
merges a branch when you pull it down

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,559
and just that automatically if you pull

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,509
in at Grange that's not yours for

00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,119
instance you can pull in a different

00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:28,589
branch all together that's why it's

00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:32,629
called for bus and not a murderer bust

00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:36,389
if that was not making sense earlier um

00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:39,240
moving on what will happen is sometimes

00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:42,959
when you go to fool is young virginal

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,730
floats um so this happens when life

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,549
let's say you're both editing the same

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,980
file right they deleted something and

00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:52,319
you still have that something or you've

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,290
made changes around that same area just

00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:56,910
close enough right if they push that up

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,100
and it's in the remote rebo and you go

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,350
to pull it down get does not know how to

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,369
handle that situation right it handles

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,749
additions or they will cause it's like

00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:04,679
well whatever was just adding stuff so

00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:07,170
doesn't matter was throw it all together

00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,670
and we're having con kotori right but

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,339
when something like that comes up

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,889
because i don't know whose work so you

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,679
gotta fix it now there's much a way

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,720
around these you can do strategy options

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,529
you can do rebasing rebasing that's my

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,060
recommended way

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:26,850
linkedin the slide which doesn't help

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:28,019
you at all but realize that later um but

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,100
the other thing about Mercer clicks is

00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,800
that as long as you're following like a

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,779
process and everyone's kind of working

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,819
the same way you can manage your way

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,470
around merge conflicts and it won't

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,300
really come up that often the other

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,829
beautiful thing is that unless you're

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,899
the one running the open source project

00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,399
as contributor rarely you have to worry

00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,170
about that piece right as long as you

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,639
follow their contribution documentation

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,290
they don't really have much to say

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,860
except okay we'll take care of the

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,569
merchant flow impose but that also leads

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,550
to the very important point of if you

00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,689
want to contribute to a project you

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,809
should maybe read the documentation

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:03,149
first before you do that or else you

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:09,180
will have wasted effort and be very sad

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:12,660
like I was so the final thing before we

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:14,430
kind of do the demo is where does the

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,579
source code go and the answer to that is

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,620
anywhere you want it to go really github

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:23,509
get loud bitbucket these are all just

00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:27,209
front ends for a remote get server okay

00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:29,100
when you when you push to those it's not

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:30,660
just sitting on their box the same as if

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,209
it was studying anywhere else so you can

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,370
honestly you can push to my laptop if

00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:37,889
you had that set up as a remote you can

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,000
manage multiple of these remotes but the

00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:40,980
the reason I bring it up is because

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,689
github adds extra things like submitting

00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,209
issues and adds a grooving on top of

00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,319
doing things like clover class etc so

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,850
it's you get all these additional

00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,189
features with something like the front

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,930
but the important thing to note is that

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:55,709
it doesn't do anything that you can't

00:15:51,930 --> 00:16:00,240
just do in the command line using git or

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:02,129
any other get doing so worthless now

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
we're at that point kind of food through

00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,550
it mostly because everyone ruler news

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,949
gets so was on a lot of Reason spent on

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:12,540
time on it let's kind of go through that

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:18,809
process so can everyone read oh no one

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,009
else can see that man that's why I want

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:23,260
to mirror these because it would be way

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:31,990
easier but here we are

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:31,990
okay you are not my friend go away oh

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:45,410
not going to get my cursor over there to

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:55,360
maximum is this all right move along all

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:59,360
right and then blue months there we go

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,790
hi that works very well i would say okay

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,960
so i'm assuming that you were able to

00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,760
figure out how to sign up for a game of

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,670
account if you're not might be happy to

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,050
help you after the book so you know when

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,400
you sign up then you can see here like

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,510
so you're using a password in my

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,380
username is definitely not magic

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,360
Robinson um and you find an open source

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,830
project if you wanna contribute to this

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,710
is one of my own source projects what

00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,790
book club and what you do is you go here

00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,590
and you look and you're like okay this

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,820
is cool and if you check with him to

00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,980
read me see what the school does

00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,450
everything sweet right and then most of

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,850
the time if there were contributing to

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,680
they'll have a contributing document or

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,140
sometimes section telling you how to

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,140
handle their stuff right so here you can

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,480
say just for kit create an issue figure

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,790
feature branch you push a ranch up in

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,080
this swimsuit forward west and it says

00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,110
they're all for requests you go to the

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,160
developer inch right not master so

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,110
that's really simple really

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,060
straightforward and what we're going to

00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,390
do is like okay well it says submitted

00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,790
issue so let's so let's go something

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,100
issue and you're like oh wait the thing

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,370
I wanted to work on is already here

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,500
right and it says should be i'll remove

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,670
a file from the profile easily here's

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,530
what the commands of applied since

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,060
aren't already used and the issue be

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:16,790
perfect fixing about my linux fest which

00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:18,770
is incredibly convenient um so you had

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,150
this issue and the thing we look for is

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,970
if you don't know what you want to work

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:25,490
on go find an issue that already exists

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,050
that's really defined in scope and if

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,530
anything has like a speck of what it

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,230
should look like

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,450
you're done because the best way to get

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,310
started to do something small right so

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,420
my first full request was to add

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:39,500
blockquote styling to a web app like I

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,360
didn't do any things that make the

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,340
background gray instead of an ugly

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,920
yellow and made it stand out a little

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,930
better you know what and I feel super

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,040
cool when I go see that now that's a

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,310
little piece of me out there on the

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,840
internet and you know it's like super

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,280
pumped but it was like it's a super

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,750
small change it took me like 30 minutes

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,270
to make and like get it right and then

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,250
send the pull request right 30 mins from

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,050
start to finish and so it's really easy

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,060
to just get started and once you do that

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,650
right it's kind of like ecstasy like you

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,360
dig it the first time this is awesome

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,730
they're like I see what you doing that

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,870
you know it's that was probably not

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:18,860
great analogy they're not going to be

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,960
back oh so so once you find the issue

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,680
you're like okay cool hey all right I

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,940
will work on this so they simply slow

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,110
comment there because you're not a

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,000
contributor so you can't like take

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,290
ownership or anything like that but you

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,360
going to say hey overcome this and they

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,490
know hey you know somebody's working on

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,500
this we're not going to worry about it

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,850
so once you do that right the first step

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,680
on that tribute augmentation was to fork

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,050
it there's a clearly label sport button

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,380
it took me three days to find it was it

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:47,150
in I clicked it here we are and so like

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,510
i said earlier right you now have your

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:52,700
own copy of that project right this is

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,500
your special copy no one else has this

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,570
and this is what leads to things like

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,920
people for can get you right you know I

00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:02,690
don't like systemd let's click that

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:05,210
button so once you've had that you then

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,530
go to the clone right copy the cone URL

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,980
they have a really community button for

00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:11,960
that you go back to terminal right and

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,630
just like in the slide run git clone

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,170
give it that URL what it's going to do

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,210
network permitting yeah all right I was

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,400
scared playing that part um so once you

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,380
do that you'll notice that there's a dfm

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,120
folder that it downloaded and created

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,250
and it even says clothing into dfm to

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,600
let you know once you see the into there

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,809
you see that I had a couple backup plans

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,010
I was ready

00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,350
so once you do that you'll notice

00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,390
because my match prompt is special it

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,070
says that I'm on master but if you run

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,870
the git status command like I said once

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,820
you get in there it tells you everything

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,080
right says hey you're a bridge master

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,419
your branch is up to date with the

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,549
remote master that you clone from which

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,690
is origin in this instance and you have

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,460
nothing to admit working very quickly

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,570
because like for instance you haven't

00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,940
done anything so I can be creative

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,070
powerful test right so now we have this

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,870
extra folder or the sector file drunk

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,400
it's a DeCinces hey alright dude you got

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,410
none trap file you should stay to that

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,450
with the get add command right can

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,100
everyone in the back see that the too

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,919
far down alright we're going to do this

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:15,400
actually better idea there we go alright

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,049
so you see that says on track pilot says

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,419
run get that file to include what will

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,740
be committed but note that we're soul in

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,820
the master branch and we're not bad

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,610
people so we're going to go ahead and

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,020
create a branch call at RM f command

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,929
because I was the issue that we took

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,660
right now we've created our ranch but

00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:33,820
you'll notice there were so on Brant I'm

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,710
a master and that's no good no point 0

00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,110
and so we're going to go ahead and check

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,730
out the bridge that we just created if i

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:44,049
decline it will work great ahaha victory

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,940
so now we see this it says here the

00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,160
round one or two are met man but fun

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,780
fact is a difficult move on try file so

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,040
if you have on stage changes or anything

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,809
and you create your branch and check it

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,460
out it's going to just kind of turn this

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,540
over to be wrench so even if you start

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,910
working on stuff on the master branch

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,850
you don't have to be a bad person you

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,610
can fix it so once you have the stage

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,510
anything once you do that right so we're

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,820
going to go ahead and move that desk

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,470
bottom we don't have that our community

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,700
but you're going to go ahead and you're

00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,730
going to side then you want to write

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,950
that write that code right and since I'm

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,440
both lazy and think watching the code is

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:23,530
boring I'm going to head with that so

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,669
here we are hey there we go okay so now

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,290
if you're gonna get status right we're

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:27,370
going to see here that says changes on

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,169
stage for comment so the difference

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,270
between the test file where it said on

00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,000
tracks file and change this message form

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:36,100
it is with an on tracks file it doesn't

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,990
care about any of it right until you add

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,700
it and committed it's not going to keep

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,100
change of what error i'm going to keep

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,630
track of what you changed right but once

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,669
you've committed an additive every

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,650
single changing every outline you had

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:50,110
every piece of every word you change etc

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,520
it knows about that and so i can show

00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,980
you the Delta between the two files

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,740
right so what we're going to do is we're

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,370
going to go ahead and run get ad and one

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,809
of those files with CLI fui so we go

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,610
ahead and we staged it out and some

00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:04,929
bring its status it says here you hey

00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,559
you've got a change to be committed I'm

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:10,929
going to close this so that soars on top

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,370
there we go it says hey okay you've got

00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:14,169
changes to be committed your own razor

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,210
at automatic amanda says that you modify

00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,010
this CL y py and it shows you the

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,990
command on stages so if you decide that

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,790
you know you regret your life decisions

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:25,480
and you want to go back you can do that

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:27,429
so what do you run now right is we've

00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,020
staged it right so to put it on the

00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,690
truck tie it in the bow we've got a

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,640
committed going to a minute we're gonna

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,470
go ahead run dash B so now she is going

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,820
to show us a diff of what we changed

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,040
inside of our commit message because

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,960
makes it riding me pretty easy so once

00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,919
you do that and this is the unlovable

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,150
there we go you'll see here is okay

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,980
here's the thing that you're committing

00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,290
right you modified seal light off you I

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,669
the only SS is everything below me

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,290
removed it's not going to be part of it

00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:55,000
but here's what you change means you

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:56,940
here we just added four lines right we

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,990
added the new command subcommand RMF

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,350
that's not particularly pertinent to the

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,690
talk but were in the Savior add RMF

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,970
subcommand right note there were less

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,890
than 50 characters it's really simple

00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,480
and it's just straightforward it's not I

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,970
added these individual ones that do all

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,679
these things so once you save and quit

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,850
get this going to give you some output

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,409
there and it's going to tell you hey on

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,140
a dharna that command so as the branch

00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:21,250
you're on it gives you this weird stream

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,510
and we'll talk about with that is in a

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,419
second and then it shows you your git

00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,040
commit summary okay so it says there

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:28,270
that you added the RMF subcommand and

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,370
then it says one file change five

00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,950
assertions so all this is telling you

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,990
what's on the commit right what that

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,350
funky will stream there that DVD ffff

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,289
see

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,419
man that is hard to say um is is that's

00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,440
what we called the mid hatch so if

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:42,549
you've ever heard someone say that

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,990
that's what they're talking about and

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:46,480
there's a much longer version of that

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,860
that's in the gang database but uses the

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,660
short hash because it's mostly unique

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,340
enough to get you there and so that's

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,720
how you in reference document in other

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,980
commands we're going to go over those

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
other commands because they're hard and

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,410
scary and I don't like them but that's

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,120
how you would use them so once you do

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,490
that you notice here okay babe all right

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,070
I did that right get status skin okay

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:08,799
I've got another file here you know that

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:10,570
I got to add so are you going to do that

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,520
and they're going to engage them in

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,289
touch me again when i plug my background

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,630
and there we go so now you're going to

00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:20,830
us okay this kid is a lot bigger right

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:22,360
Wow you added like 15 lines juras we

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,730
could you may not want to put those all

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,980
in one thing but ok we're going to do it

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,320
so add and remove all right let's see

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,850
you get right path move there we go and

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,429
remove from completion there we go

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,200
profile commands and they're going to

00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,900
notice there that my text editor because

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,419
I haven't figured will actually start

00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,400
change the color of the letters right so

00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:46,600
notice that nds on the end there is a

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,100
different color than the rest of it

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,669
that's because that means that I have

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,200
surpassed 50 characters right sometimes

00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:55,510
that's right to do but most the time

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,370
it's not most the time you're going to

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,929
want to do a longer form thing and so

00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:03,659
what you'll do is you'll say ok added

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:06,520
get right path and remove from profile

00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:10,360
right and say here like okay get right

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:18,010
path gets the path whether the file is a

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:21,809
daughter not Andrew profile removes the

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,809
file from the file system

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:29,830
system and profile so this is an example

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,510
of using that longer form area right so

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,770
you put this summary in that's what's

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,380
actually going to show up in the git log

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,370
right that longer form thing is only

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,530
going to show up in the get log of

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,880
someone specifically asks for in right

00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,490
the normal get lucky maybe we'll say

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,780
that the when you get done with this

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,100
you'll see that doesn't show you that

00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,840
just shows you the commit hash in that

00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:51,070
first summary so your summary should be

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,320
like sometimes like so Spartan onwards

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,780
that it's you know that doesn't tell you

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,880
anything right if I know that those

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,570
functions are tells me something but

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,400
otherwise I wouldn't know and so the

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,230
longer form is what's supposed to really

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,060
show you hey this is what this is

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,620
exactly what change this is exactly what

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,860
happened this is why we made these

00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,390
changes right so once you say even quit

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,160
out of there you see the same thing you

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,440
saw above right you got a new commit

00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,630
hash notice that it's unique yeah one

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,680
file change 34 insertions and then place

00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:25,300
that it only shows you that summary once

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,210
you've done that you'll notice now that

00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,440
you have it status but what's weird is

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,270
it's now the wrong as branch it doesn't

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,650
show us anything about origin right so

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,230
before when we were on masters said hey

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,190
you're up to date with origin master but

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,140
now it's not doing that well the reason

00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,790
that is is that even github doesn't have

00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,140
this branch yet so if we go back to our

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,570
give up arrow point and we look at our

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,410
branches there's just master and develop

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,180
right there is no at our meth command

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,960
right so we've been working on so what

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,090
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,260
ahead and take our changes all of them

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,730
and we're going to tell it to ya and so

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,190
what that's going to do is that's going

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,650
to take our new branch push it up to the

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,200
remote branch with that name and the

00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:07,540
remote there is origin and the reason is

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,700
home origin is because it is magical and

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,140
when you clone it it sets a remote but

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,390
the waiver boats work is they're mostly

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,920
like a host file right or addy in that

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,450
century right when you go to google com

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,150
right that translates to an IP address

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,310
in here origin translates to github com

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,710
or whatever remove you wanted to be in a

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,180
keeps track of its own remotes so we

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,980
have like one on one of my projects

00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,260
that's deployed so we go get push

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,539
deployed master and it will go in and

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,499
will deploy that range for us

00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:37,749
and before you push the stuff out to

00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:39,460
your origin how can you run like a

00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,799
difference to say okay what's different

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,879
between what you have your local repo

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:49,479
versus in the workshop so when we have

00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:50,799
this branch on the remote right and

00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:54,759
we'll do this to tell if it's that

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,350
upstream that men will let us know if we

00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:59,590
make further changes what's different

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,269
but the there is no add RMF command

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,479
branch on the remote so there's nothing

00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:05,739
for us to be different from so we can

00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:08,200
actually show that really quick so if we

00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:09,759
did bed and get push this up and I for

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,989
some reason I thought this was a great

00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,789
user name because I thought it's funny

00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:18,779
but now I regret it as I've defied their

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:18,779
time oh you get kidney

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,780
alright cool so so now we see that

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,900
you'll see there it says it created the

00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,690
new branch all right now if we go and

00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,740
look at github hey it actually is

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,970
already told us hey you got to be

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,980
arranged might want to pull request that

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,870
so you can go and look at it and you can

00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:52,060
say okay now this will tell you it's two

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:54,010
commits ahead of master right but if we

00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,540
want to see that locally right we've got

00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,580
to make something that's different so if

00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,520
we go ahead and like let's go ahead and

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,880
do the testing again and then we'll show

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,170
you a wolf-like here edit test file so

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,400
not less you just write the commit

00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,630
summary right there in the command line

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,270
so you don't have to use the text editor

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:13,030
deal mom so now if we go ahead run git

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:17,740
status it says your range is ahead of

00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:21,280
origin at RM f by one minute right so it

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,260
knows that the remote is at a certain

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,240
state and there are those that you are

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,830
ahead of that state now the trick with

00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,390
that though is if someone else is

00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,940
pushing to that branch on that remote

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:33,070
right it will not know about their

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,510
changes until you pull them down so it

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,000
has no way to know how many commits

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:40,800
ahead of them you are that makes sense

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,290
that's a really pretty rare occurrence

00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,700
but so it will only know if it's been

00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:51,880
snapshot it is the best way I can

00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:53,140
explain it simply so we go back and here

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,670
get hubs already kind of telling us what

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,110
we need to do right it's like okay your

00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,240
recently push branches you push this a

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:01,180
dharna man you should probably compare

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,300
in four clicks so if we want to go ahead

00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,900
and smit that back to the project it

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,970
says here okay it sets us for us you say

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,260
the baseboard and this is what this is

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,060
what trips a lot of people up still

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,430
trips me up is that it goes left leg

00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,620
goes right to left essentially so we

00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,540
think that like our branch should be the

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,400
left side and we're putting it over here

00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:25,600
which it gets to be the reverse for you

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,040
guys ears um but here it's this is the

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,450
fork I want to compare against this is

00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,580
mine and I want to switch them this

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,720
direction is essentially the best way

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,679
I'm going to stand like this so it makes

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:39,130
sense that help all right my backsides

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,870
my best side so um but the important

00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,860
thing to note here is that we don't want

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,149
to do to master because they're

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,740
contributing documentation said hey you

00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:46,480
should put it on develop so we're going

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,919
to ahead and change it to develop and

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,169
we're going to pair our branch at our

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,460
map command and it says able merge it

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,840
says that there is no more complex

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,080
basically and it shows us what commits

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,640
are different and we're gonna go ahead

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:04,980
natick homer and say like this should

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:07,240
resolve issue number 13 14 numbers and

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,860
once you do that will create a pull

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,809
request and so then you're done at that

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,240
point right this is the point where like

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:17,559
if your ass making actual them they'll

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,299
always deny it because it's never good

00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,919
enough and if you're spending someone

00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:25,480
else they'll be like yes will it help me

00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:26,919
this lawsuit and so um you'll notice

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,200
here though that like some checks I'm

00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,789
completed yet so this is like a cool

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,159
integration with github this this

00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,630
project doesn't actually work on Travis

00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,029
yet but what this is doing is it takes

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,010
the code tester code for you and then if

00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:40,750
that's successful it will let the person

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,899
know and if it fails and i'm sure it'll

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,070
fail before i'm done talking it'll also

00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:46,480
let the person know so that's just

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,830
something to help the project manager

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,190
don't be scared that it's doing things

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,539
automatically become exposed to um so

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,750
now if we go ahead and we switch over to

00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:58,480
this tab which is my actual account here

00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:02,019
as the owner I'm gonna say oh hey looks

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,549
someone open up a pull request and you

00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,980
can look and I can like go in here and

00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm like oh I can see I want to see what

00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,860
they changed so

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:22,080
oh no they changed the you oughtta know

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:27,180
me I do not like that thanks get up

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,370
you're the bomb well that's good here oh

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,080
there we go okay all right we got there

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:34,530
so it says here that it did they change

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,910
the download URL right and you can see

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,200
that you know they deleted that why you

00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,610
had at that line that's the way they get

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,710
views changing a line is that its

00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,120
removal in an addition so that's why

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:43,470
would you run these merge conflicts when

00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,550
you guys have work on nearly the same

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:50,190
sections of code so if I go through and

00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,990
I say hey that looks really good right

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,470
and I read the codes of course I'm going

00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:59,280
to say that I go in here on that a

00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:03,000
comment that's like a thanks for the PR

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:08,010
you are smart and funny and then all

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:13,020
pose and comment and no I did the wrong

00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:15,060
thing this is all covered okay all right

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:19,020
hey all right I'll worse the pull

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,670
request confirm the verge and then the

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,230
full request is closed after that and so

00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:26,100
then emerged into Jason want to develop

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:28,230
right so if we then go and look at the

00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:32,040
project that we contributed to we can go

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:37,970
look at their develop branch and you

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:41,040
will see the commit log will have your

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,180
name and because the email is the same

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,340
for those two accounts that says that I

00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,780
made always changes which is mostly true

00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,430
but I really wanted to say definitely

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:53,790
not matthew robinson how it went great

00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:56,880
well here we are so that is contributing

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,140
to an open source projects does anyone

00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,130
have any questions is i'm not sure i

00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,600
could get this powerpoint to look nice

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,720
and shove my questions page but we'll

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,720
try

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:22,619
hey hey so yes so let's say you did a

00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:24,680
bunch of work committed them and then

00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:31,890
you figured out that everything is

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:33,869
garbage to previous state there's a

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,730
bunch of all ways to do that um so

00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:37,440
rebasing can get you back there as well

00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,770
you can do an interactive rebase and

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,170
undo the commits you can do a git reset

00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,510
head that is like the really dirty way

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,859
to do it it's the easiest way but if

00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,230
you're working with other people you

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:50,940
have to force push those changes back so

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,619
if it's on you only your range and only

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,819
you're working with that will get you

00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,380
there like that no problem the better

00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:00,150
way if it's only a couple changes are

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,770
only a couple commits whatever you get

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,660
refer command is the best tonight it

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,369
will literally create a new commit

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,529
object that undoes the committee you

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:10,740
tomm do as where you need to commit hat

00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:15,359
though do you want a web front end or

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,559
not well if you want to web front end

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,779
you've got to get one of the web front

00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,079
end so get labs open source gods as open

00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:24,119
source is a good one get itself is its

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,450
own server as well so if there's a

00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,910
server that you have and you install the

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,950
gift package on it and you have ssh key

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,930
set up to go to that gate we'll just

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,940
work it will just be able to let you

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,200
push their no problems you got to do a

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,059
little bit set up on the remote side of

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,380
the set of the repo and stuff if you

00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:42,150
know where to push to this really easy

00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,160
getting one of the web front-end setup

00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,420
is pretty easy to sew dogs is a really

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,490
easy once got a docker container you

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:51,990
just pull it on running

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:55,710
so GOx you said yes web pretend it's

00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,330
freely available yo got on top yep and

00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,310
that's that projects have some get up

00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,160
and then get live itself is also open

00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,630
source and free to set up but it's much

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,040
more complicated doesn't want more stuff

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:13,020
I have a bunch of files of your knife

00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:20,630
txt files there you will have a very bad

00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:24,540
time it doesn't be put in the ignored in

00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:26,640
the ignored so the gift get door is just

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,680
a in the repo you put a top you get

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,450
ignore file and then you just tell it

00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,440
patterns and you can do wild cards and

00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,270
stuff like that just like you would for

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,130
any bash command essentially and it'll

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,660
just ignore that subset of files so if

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,360
you give it a folder Nagle's ignore

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,970
everything underneath that there's

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,010
there's tools that extend get to work

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,980
with that kind of stuff so I get all FS

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:51,270
large file storage but merging those

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,060
things is like I have no good analogy

00:37:51,270 --> 00:38:00,840
for it I it's like shaving with a cheese

00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:02,880
grater I guess so i get annex yeah i

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,850
have not had much luck with get Mannix

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,500
I've got yella get all of us to work I

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:16,490
cannot say it was the best use of my

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:19,340
time then you gave a nice little example

00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:22,610
yep now if you haven't

00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:26,390
group office workers using microsoft

00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:33,260
office tools who say we want to have a

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:36,670
shared directory that everyone they're

00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,670
still going to have a similar issue

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:58,040
would you say yeah so we actually have a

00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,380
team of kroger that does that down on

00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,090
what we call the Geo and I went down

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,980
there for a day and I held their hand

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,330
and we got them set up and got them

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,220
working as long as they know how to use

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,180
it like if you give them a nice gooey

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,440
and they understand that you think you

00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,930
or to understand that little works at

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,000
least on a beautiful if they know what

00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,770
those things mean they're going to be

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,630
great and as a matter of fact I know

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,670
github does that for their entire county

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,400
department stuff like that it's really

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,690
really great for that kind of thing the

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,490
trick that I find is that a lot of

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,370
people don't want to get too complicated

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,290
tool right and even even just what I

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:31,940
showed here for some people are not

00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,010
reminded that way it can be a difficult

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:37,580
thing to get going so once i understand

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:43,130
it yep it's amazing for that but we also

00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:45,410
have shared drives so you one of the

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,810
nodes of regarding that question is the

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,810
problem that you have of anything

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:52,030
that is is merging files when there are

00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,100
changes especially it works very well

00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,930
for text and it's designed to handle

00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,510
text but it doesn't know how to merge

00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,970
binary bottles right need to have a tool

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,230
which one of our primary products so

00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,910
anything that's like a Microsoft Office

00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:06,670
formats going to get to not going to

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:09,990
support out of box as long as there's as

00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:12,010
long as no two people ever change a flat

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,220
however there is one thing that I tried

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,980
a couple of years ago which which works

00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,130
which works surprisingly well it was a

00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:25,060
tortoise get on Windows and surprisingly

00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:27,400
it actually liked his impis put word and

00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,130
think that is it is merge mode where it

00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,590
will do that you use Microsoft tools to

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,590
do the merge and then you know

00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,890
it gets the front of it yeah Taurus get

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,970
sauce we use towards give me a source

00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:46,520
tree and what those things are awesome

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,930
the Microsoft Office file finland which

00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,120
ones yeah but you're right so Melissa

00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,860
does not play nice some of it does play

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,610
better but that's why it goes back to

00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,200
like they have to know what they're

00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,180
doing like if they're all working off a

00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,530
master branch they're going to have a

00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,870
bad time and they're going to be like

00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,580
just give me a flash drive right they're

00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,930
going to be miserable and you're going

00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,510
to be miserable because you're the one

00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:07,010
has to support that so as long as they

00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,570
understand branching and all that how

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:13,010
did merchants and servants it's not so

00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:18,380
bad so I hand over here yep whatever the

00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:21,800
VI editor this is just the standard is

00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:25,190
that mean it when you mean for editing

00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:28,340
amid message we have a pretty gay basher

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,980
on like actual units actually actually

00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,270
built me second month of the yeah it

00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,580
probably tell me you're not put anything

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:41,390
there yeah okay I was just when I blank

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:43,460
lines me the summary anyone else geez

00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,860
get tags for anything or what's the use

00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,390
case so few times are really great when

00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,490
you're using so we use a process called

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,870
get flow which is just like it's a

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,490
branching model there's some time to

00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,170
documentation on how to use it guitars

00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,270
are really great for doing releases so

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,550
the way gift flow versus essentially you

00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,620
have the master branch and that French

00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,300
never be committed directly to that's

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,470
why I said oh don't do that earlier cuz

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,510
you're just being your master branch is

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,160
going to be your deployed code right

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,260
that's going to be your released code

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,340
and and what you do is you create the

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,690
developer answer that has all the

00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,540
development in it and when you merge

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,700
develop into master that's called a

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,410
release and then you tag that and then

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,520
you can reference that Lily easily and

00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,480
say hey I just want to go back to

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,280
version 03 instead of like dfgdf ff7 you

00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,070
know like you can remember how I look at

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,570
these your way to refer to yeah it's a

00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,040
bookmarking tool really is what that

00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,750
comes out to but github integrates

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,830
really nicely

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:39,850
releases and soft okay so you made that

00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:43,840
min branch and its mark on it so let's

00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:48,010
say you go don't work on anything and

00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,570
you come back and you want to work on

00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,020
that branch but you can't remember the

00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:54,820
name if you just want to get branch with

00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:03,310
no arguments of what's all the branches

00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:06,670
on your machine anything else what's the

00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:08,770
best practice for let's say there are

00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:12,030
files that that you want to eat it for

00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:15,850
yourself locally but like Brooke the

00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:21,910
cloud that that you don't want to push

00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:25,540
too yeah that's i mean that's that's the

00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:29,410
exact to use case yeah but so things

00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,000
like like I have customized get convince

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:33,040
for some of my repo so that like I have

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,300
different emails for her things I keep

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,810
all those you two getting orders I want

00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,060
to push this up just a warning if you do

00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,730
that to remember that it's there's no

00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,050
backup for that yes yeah I mean if you

00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,240
lose your laptop you lose that Lyle

00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,240
right so it's also not track

00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,560
and get status will not show it so if

00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,120
isn't Lee get ignored you're like I want

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,460
to know what's on track right if it's in

00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:12,250
there it's attractive it just pretends

00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:13,600
it doesn't exist yeah yeah if you want

00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,360
your own custom ignore list you can do

00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,570
that so I have the tools you are using

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:25,090
so like I saw you push the code and some

00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:26,260
automatic automated job so for most most

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,690
of my whole sort of stuff i just use

00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:33,040
travis my also Jenkins server that us

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,260
some things added up separately yeah

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,850
it's yeah it's nothing I'm good Travis

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,320
was like super well documented pretty

00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,180
easy to get going as longer use and get

00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,100
out if you're using something else you

00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,670
have to use their thing so get a lot has

00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,800
their own CI bitbucket has a nothing so

00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:51,790
instead of Jenkins or whatever like what

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,350
kind of things test yeah yeah so so at

00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,610
work we have tuesday circle right every

00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,750
time you put your coat up team city's

00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,100
going to go out there some roller tats

00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,210
going to fill your thing it's going to

00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,530
build your artifact we're going to put

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,670
it into our factory though and then

00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,670
somebody's gonna deploy that thing

00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:09,340
automatically so that's that's what

00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:12,370
continuous integration is it reuses from

00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,830
your banker Claire yeah so I keep keep

00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:18,570
ansible my vigor and stuff all that dumb

00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:25,180
profile soon that's all I'm Gary goes

00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:26,680
salt we have salt to this it's that's in

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,420
the last hockey mention that we're

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,860
if you have a bigger caller ID so many

00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,930
so pretty to change we started off court

00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:36,070
requests that's where somebody when you

00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:47,770
could put these beggar stash Jenkin okay

00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:55,390
yeah you like okay fair anyone else

00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:58,630
right time am I gonna take audio cool
