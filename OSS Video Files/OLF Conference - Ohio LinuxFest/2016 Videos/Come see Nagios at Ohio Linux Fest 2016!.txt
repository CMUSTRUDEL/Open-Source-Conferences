The Keynote will highlight the benefits of the entrepreneurial spirit, what it takes to be a founder, and lessons learned along the way of building a successful software startup with its roots in Open Source. He’ll go into the advantages that Open Source software provides entrepreneurs and how organizations can leverage technology and it’s own expertise to kickstart their own entrepreneurial venture. Ethan will share tips and tricks he has learned along the way, as well as things aspiring entrepreneurs will love, hate, and accomplish along their own journey.
