columbus this year we're going to be in

Convention Center this year we're

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,780

which is attached to the convention

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,060
center but that's going to be kind of

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,170
nice and it lexus keep thing that

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,260
there's going to be a lot less walking

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,330
then there has been in years past which

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,570
is one of the complaints people have got

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,550
a given us but so we're we made some

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,720
improvements there and we're going to

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,660
have a whole bunch of talks it's going

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,480

october seventh and eighth and we have

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,760
several registration options one of

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,330
which is you can sign up and attend

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,250
entirely for free name your own price

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,030
yes nice you can always throw us some

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:29,630
some extra money if you want yeah

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,820
there's a supporter registration and and

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:35,510
the professional registration which is

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,000
you know bit higher and there's extra

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,550
things that come along with that like

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,440
lunch and t-shirt and and professional

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,200
training as well yeah yeah the

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,390
professional one is sort of the we have

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,190
some some really good instructors that

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,850
are coming in and they're going to be

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:58,460
talking about things like ansible

00:06:52,850 --> 00:07:00,680
OpenStack setting up ssl which is having

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,220
done it is more difficult than it first

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,990
seems and you know a bunch of different

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,720
classes so you get to pick one in the

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,450
morning and one

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,700
the afternoon to attend it's awesome so

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,380
I guess the only that the usual thing is

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,550
you know we like to talk about like

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,890
because I don't think people realize how

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,260
important links is and every day how

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:22,530
much is being used I think when people

00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,440
mostly think of Linux it's it's that

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,210
thing that some some IT guy knows about

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,510
for some some server somewhere that I

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,190
never see right which is right but but

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,560
it there is a lot of day to day in lot

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,210
more interesting uses they're being done

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,510
with it like what are some things that

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,280
the day day but more techie user maybe

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,490
you're encountering a linux in some

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,790
fashion well as you said there's a you

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:49,680
know a huge amount of use on servers of

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,060
course every every single android phone

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,620
out there runs on the linux kernel

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,410
although it kind of gives you a

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,720
different interface then you might see

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,090
on the desktop but it's it's all running

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,530
linux and other free software on there

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,290
so it's it really has taken the entire

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,860
scale from running on these tiny devices

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:15,800
all the way up to you know mainframe

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,690
computers we've got all sorts of IBM and

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,169
supercomputers that are running on on

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:25,470
linux as well so in terms of a desktop

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,790
it's still probably a low percentage i

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,200
don't know what the latest numbers would

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:33,690
be but it's ty use it every day as my

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,849
primary desktop and I'm well more maybe

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,589
more importantly my parents use it every

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,219
day so it's not like it's something that

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:45,980
is you know you need to be you know some

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:49,680
some incredible geek to be able to use

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,650
or be like me that squeezed ubuntu on a

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,060
pre intel mac oh yeah that is already

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,000
that's pretty impressed so it's a wonder

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,310
of a project right there you know but

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,140
the other than that but now yeah it

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,520
seems that it's it's becoming more

00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,230
prevalent i know even on the tech shows

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,700
that i listen to especially the ones

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,080
over the TWiT network where they have

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,520
people you know you know just like the

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,620
good old screensavers days calling him

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,640
with questions and everything they're

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,560
saying like you know i like ugly

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,880
somebody was was just this week i think

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,589
i'm the new screensavers talking about

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,300
you know is this for me how do i get

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,800
into it what what version of length

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,910
should i be using and

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,920
and there they had a good recommendation

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,839
like try it you can dual boot you got

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,570
both on your Windows 10 laptop sale

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,910
right and as you find that you're more

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,470
and more using the other thing then you

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,019
get rid of Windows 10 if you find that

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,209
everything you need is there and I think

00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,329
a lot of people don't realize that how

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:42,570
much is just fly on there right no I

00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,370
mean for the day-to-day user and and to

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,750
be honest you don't really even you know

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,200
if you want to use some of this open

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,089
source and free software I mean you can

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
if you choose I wouldn't say I recommend

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,200
it but you can you can continue to use

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,110
Windows you can you know run programs

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,940
like Firefox and like the VLC media

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,339
player and a bunch of other things that

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,740
are applications that are free and open

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,089
source software right right and it's

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,040
gonna be I mean I find myself running

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,290
into like the production side having

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,899
problems because i'm a very Mac Final

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,760
Cut version right yeah but but so much

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,250
or Adobe or something like that but

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,660
there are alternatives certainly if

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,450
you're willing to look out for them yeah

00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,589
Media Productions a little more

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,209
difficult there are there are options

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:30,870
out there and the the caveat seems to be

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:33,149
is you know is who is behind it and who

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,390
is doing the development and if they

00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,130
have resources to be able to to continue

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,339
it and kind of put that final polish

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,649
line right exactly so we're kind of

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,029
things that the people can can get into

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:48,680
where you're kind of tracks over there

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,579
oh hi all in express this year so are

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,070
we're gonna have a whole variety of

00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:56,040
topics so we kind of clustered them into

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,750
a few different tracks or all over again

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,279
we're gonna actually have a career track

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,500
again this year that's something we've

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,730
been having the past few years we'll

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:09,660
have a few topics on sort of developing

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:14,130
your your own personal brand and trying

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:17,490
to you know turn your your presentation

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,339
skills into a basically avoiding death

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,540
by powerpoint is the is the is the topic

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,550
which is it can be pretty apt we have a

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,459
few other technical tracks that are

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,930
coming in we have one that's on

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,819
virtualization and cloud computing's a

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:38,149
lot of stuff about OpenStack

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:41,789
a kvm juju which is a new thing that

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:43,799
ubuntu and canonical are doing we've got

00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:46,979
a whole scaling track which is kind of

00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,649
you know how do you do your operations

00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:54,839
on a large scale and so you have things

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:56,789
like mysql replication and we actually

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,079
have a couple of a couple of people from

00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:00,600
facebook that are gonna be coming and

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,059
talking about how how they operate some

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,929
of their things on free and open source

00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,579
software at at that massive scale so a

00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,109
little bit everything I know you do

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:12,989
something I hadn't turned and heard

00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:15,149
about so this is their the kind of the

00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:18,539
Ubuntu cloud computing initiative it

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:22,169
looks like it's I'm not the best person

00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:24,149
to ask about it because I did of attend

00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:26,369
one talk about it and I'm sure I'm not

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:28,069
quite sure I still completely understand

00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,539
it because it's not intended to replace

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:33,419
something like OpenStack it's supposed

00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:36,359
to sit on top of it and be and an

00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:40,799
orchestration manager i think is is what

00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:42,149
they term it so i still don't quite have

00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,549
an understanding it if you go to this

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:47,549
talk you will know a lot more than what

00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:49,619
i do i do do because i still haven't

00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:53,129
quite grasped loaded what exactly it's

00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:54,209
about right and of course um and I heard

00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,100
you guys talking a little bit before

00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:57,899
about raspberry PI's having a little bit

00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,159
for presence here as well right and I

00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:00,569
know we've talked about on the show I've

00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,519
been experimenting with it a little bit

00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:04,199
for certain functions around the house

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,699
and again comp playing with some

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:10,229
different different distributions one

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:11,309
for a security camera what I last few

00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,350
years we're up to like the third

00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:15,509
iteration raspberry pi raspberry pi

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,999
zeros there like five bucks or something

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:19,859
out there what are you guys seeing as

00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:21,359
that kind of is there like a growing

00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,519
presence II heard a year as more people

00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:26,220
are discovering this as as something

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,499
that can get things done it's something

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,399
that's it it really is in attracting a

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:35,039
different sort of audience than maybe

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,239
we've had because it allows you to

00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,249
actually interact with the physical

00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:40,559
world instead is being limited to okay

00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:42,230
i'm going to develop the software and

00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,380
maybe it's going to run on a website or

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:50,960
do whatever we can actually have things

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:53,790
that maybe operate robots or you know do

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,800
or hooked up to sensors like cameras or

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,870
temperature sensors you know monitor

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,870
your beer fridge to see if how cold it

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,950
is do the important stuff exactly you

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,400
know you gotta you got to keep that

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,810
stuff under control so we're gonna have

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,790
somebody who's going to give it a talk

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,260
on basically looking at the variety of

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,690
options because there are a lot of

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,790
different devices that are available out

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,440
there now and kind of kind of review

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,980
what are the strengths and weaknesses of

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,510
the various ones and then as Susan I

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,360
think can maybe talk a little bit more

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,160
about is the giveaways are going to be

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,960
we're gonna have a group of podcasters

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,670
there who are going to have a little

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:35,520
area in our vendor expo yes um now I

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,810
just wanted to just miss listening to

00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,380
Vance and thinking about all the things

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:42,840
that I wanted to add in there is is in

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,940
the Internet of Things the Linux is

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,440
embedded in a number of different things

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,150
that you don't even know about it might

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,940
be in your washing machine or in your

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,490
coffee pot or something there's lots of

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:59,130
small linux programs that are that are

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:01,340
running out there but but it's a really

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:05,160
interesting that there's been

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:08,940
cross-pollination with open source

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,160
software and open hardware and trying to

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,950
keep the hardware open enough so the

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,010
hardware is in proprietary so that the

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,470
open source software can can run on it

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,610
and one of the ways to do that is of

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,500
course build your own devices and and

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:29,040
the the thing that I really like to see

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:33,320
is especially with young people is to be

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,420
involved in the maker movement and

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,400
rusuli was one of our was one of our

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,710
speakers a few years ago and she was

00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,680
saying that when she was a kid growing

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:46,560
up it was like oh cool how can I make

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,210
that you know so I think if we kind of

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,850
instill that in our kids and show them

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,530
these raspberry pies and everything else

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,390
that they're doing in the maker

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,690
community and and and bring them on

00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,100
board as part of the free and open

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,370
source

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,070
community software freedom community is

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,960
just it's just like peanut butter and

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:10,770
jelly they were just meant to to go

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:14,190
together so I'm talking about community

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,620
I'm the social media community manager

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:20,120
for ohio linux fest and i just wanted to

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:24,030
mention that this is our 14th year and

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,180
back that i think there's a number of

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,740
people that have been there every year

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,280
including my daughter who's Beth lanai

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,880
kerr and she helps run the ohio linux

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:39,600
fest but the very first year was held at

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:46,290
ohio state university campus and it was

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:48,570
a statewide lug meeting for ohio for all

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,270
different linux users groups that came

00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,670
there and and it was it was so good that

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,140
the next year she volunteered and the

00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,690
next year she came back and came back

00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,540
and came back and I'm pretty soon she

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,580
was pretty pretty involved in it and I

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,800
got involved in it too and it's and it's

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,680
been a really a wonderful experience and

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,320
and it's a community that is like a

00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,860
coming home every year to to this

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,290
community we get to know each other over

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:19,110
the course of the years you get to know

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:22,680
the volunteers that come back you know

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:25,250
continuously and we have a lot of social

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,420
things going on in Ohio linux fest too

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:34,830
there's a on Friday night there's a

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,690
happy hour that is sort of right after

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,760
the keynote and before the birds of

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:43,590
feather groupings on which are on Friday

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,510
night members of the feather are really

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,550
great because that's where people can

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,210
really network and really throw up their

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:53,090
own little group to discuss the topics

00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:56,640
that interest them the most and then on

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,890
Saturday there's the after party and no

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,710
geez what else there's the dinner with

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:08,100
the keynotes there's you know so many

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:11,820
ways to UM to network and to feel the

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,930
love actually feel the love of a freedom

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,110
of software freedom

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,210
and and and hardware freedom and I think

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,070
that's probably what keeps bringing me

00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,900
back as well I think saying it's not

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,460
just the people there they're diehard

00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,140
into this you know people income or

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,300
enthusiast for it and we use it for a

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,040
device or to check it out it's going to

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,290
our alternatives i think that's that's

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,150
pretty cool is you talk about the career

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,130
the career track is there like a

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,500
beginner truck is it set up in track so

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,640
there's like a beginner intermediate

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,270
advanced or is it kind of choose your

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,910
own adventure or so what we do is we get

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,310
we get proposals we put out an open call

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,650
for proposals so we get a whole bunch of

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,230
things come in and so when we are

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:55,860
selecting those i try to organize them

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,920
into sort of tracks they're not planned

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,900
out that way necessarily but you know

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,400
I've tried to organize them so that the

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,310
career track is one that's actually

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,080
planned out specifically to relate to a

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,330
career skills and it's something that

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,400
we've we've been doing for the past

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,520
three years something like that it's

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,130
been reasonably popular so we felt like

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,100
it's it's something that is useful to

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,920
people not just to get the technical

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:27,060
information but maybe get a little some

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:31,220
soft skills as well court awesome so

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:35,340
actually this this year our theme is

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,440
entrepreneurship and innovation and so

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,710
the career track plays heavily in that

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,840
but actually the whole conference is

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:48,500
about is about your career because

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:53,220
networking with others that that are in

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:55,850
IT and and programming and things like

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,750
that are is a great it's a great way to

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:02,430
move up in your in your career and also

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,000
so for example if you want to move into

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,040
a job about cloud computing or opens

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
there's a cloud track there's a

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,850
virtualization cloud track so if that's

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,030
something you want to do you jump into

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,790
that track or you know there's a scaling

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:21,090
track so I mean there there's some ones

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:25,280
that are more developer oriented ones

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,100
that are more cement type of

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,440
oriented so so it can help you kind of

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,990
taste the flavor of different careers

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,990
within the world of computing and that's

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,540
even without it being you know the year

00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,870
for entrepreneurship careers and

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,580
innovation you know so um so that's good

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,560
advance that you want to tell them a

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,410
little bit more about what the keynotes

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,090
are talking about sure so so we have

00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,310
three key notes that we're going to be

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,240
we're going to be having one of them is

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:59,510
going to be Ethan Gulf stat he's the

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:02,960
founder of nagios enterprises so nagios

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:06,410
is an open source project which is

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,780
involved with basically monitoring so if

00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:14,060
you have 80 different servers running

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,950
you know 120 different services on there

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,200
this is one way for you to keep tabs on

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,750
all of them and get alerts when things

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,310
aren't functioning right I mean it's

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,520
been around for a while so he's going to

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:29,150
talk about not so much his past

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,960
experience but why you should be the

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,850
next tech entrepreneur out there so that

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,990
I'll be Ethan's and then we're gonna

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:42,830
have a interestingly enough a

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,840
father-daughter team uh Joe born he's a

00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:49,460
guy who's been involved with startups

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:51,440
for about 20 20 25 years and he was

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:54,710
involved with a company called new rose

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,340
that made media centers that ran Linux

00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:01,250
and now he's actually doing another

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:05,270
startup which you may remember the name

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,820
Iowa on stereo equipment that was it's

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,350
he's reviving that they've got the name

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,250
and they reviving it to produce these

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:15,320
bluetooth speakers that are pretty

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:17,090
they're pretty high-powered if you if

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,980
you go and listen to the demo online you

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:23,180
can you can you can see they're pretty

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,480
they're pretty interesting so and then

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:30,200
his daughter actually was involved with

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,850
doing designing a cup that was to be

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,530
usable with people who have like

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,200
Parkinson's or some other sort of motor

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,240
control issues and it's a tip resistant

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,740
come

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,110
and I see you have the the screen up

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,110
there right now so yeah so she started

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:49,780
working on this when she was 10 and she

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:52,210
she came sorry comicos her grandfather

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,340
yeah yeah you know someone in the family

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,380
that really needed and so she came up

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,800
with the design and then she worked with

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,630
her father to help crowdfunded and at

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,180
this point they've you know they've made

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:07,240
and sold tens of thousands of these cups

00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,390
and I think they have ceramic version

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,020
and a plastic version and then our third

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,760
keynote is going to be Kathryn Devlin

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,690
she is someone who if you've been to a

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,670
high Linux but linux best before she

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,350
should be very familiar she's she's one

00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:27,850
of the outstanding speakers she's been

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:31,660
Oh probably probably 10 times she's

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,550
given presentations and very involved in

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,490
the in the Python community but now she

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,920
works you know what do you think when

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,580
you think of innovation you think of you

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,940
know what what organization probably the

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,680
US government right that's that's this

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,720
live innovative well believe it or not

00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,880
there are actually actually groups

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,300
within the government that are involved

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,390
with this stuff and she is one of them

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,220
with one of them called 18f which is

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,140
part of the General Services

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,800
Administration they do a lot of the

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,930
supplies and stuff like that for for the

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,890
rest of the government and so they are

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,890
bringing free and open source software

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,720
practices and moderns you know sort of

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,700
software practices and trying to bring

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,680
that into the government to kind of you

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,880
know bring us at least into the 20th

00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:27,120
century if not the 21st century so so

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,960
that's that's an interesting take on on

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,550
doing that innovation and

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,120
entrepreneurship you know within a

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:37,420
government context awesome awesome so

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:41,110
that is of course that's a two weekends

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,270
yep so that we a week from Friday and

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,100
Saturday that's right yeah october seven

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,140
eight hey right there in columbus ohio

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,180
so a lot of our pittsburgh people not

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,990
too far to go if you want to go check it

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,880
out become part of this

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,120
and of course everything's at ohio linux

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,640
dot or exactly yeah yeah it's only a

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,500
three hour drive in actually if you're

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,290
coming from Pittsburgh if you have any

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,350
trouble getting hotels really close to

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,450
the close to that although you could go

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:12,380
back and forth in one day but why miss

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,000
the after party so so so if you have any

00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,950
trouble getting a place downtown

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,320
actually along the way back to

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,490
Pittsburgh there's some Reynolds

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,000
reynoldsburg and Newark New is it Newark

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,490
and run reynoldsburg and which is about

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,200
30 minutes out it's sort of like driving

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,330
women Monroeville only you're on your

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,580
way home anyway and there's a whole

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,640
bunch of have stayed in heat this past

00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,080
hour go out there for a music concert I

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,000
wouldn't throw in fortville so there's

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,179
this place that's like along the way 10

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,820
hotels in that oh yeah and another and

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:49,730
beyond that do you know how the Airbnb

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,280
game is in columbus ohio i have to admit

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,830
i have not checked that so yeah if you

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,250
get on there you might be you know you

00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,510
might be ahead of the game I'm actually

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,100
searching right now I don't know

00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,600
actually you know I think there is a law

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,370
because I was looking for a Airbnb as a

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,750
possibility when I stayed out there for

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,700
the concert but we're too far out of

00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,200
town really and yeah there looks like

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,300
there's a good bit going on here

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,330
actually so you can air B&B that pretty

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,710
quick so definitely work while I've done

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,710
a few our b and b's and they were

north market com and that is a great

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:38,330
place to get lost into for an hour or

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,179

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,429
crawl and there's going to be let's see

00:27:51,470 --> 00:28:00,080
one two three four five six seven about

00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:03,260
eight podcasters represented in the pot

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,399
the linux podcast corner in our in our

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,600
expo hall at so some like one I don't

00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:11,240
know which one but some of them are

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,889
going to be live but otherwise but

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,539
otherwise I'm sure they'll be all

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,360
bringing back great information and

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:19,159
great stories to tell in their podcasts

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,169
it's awesome about about their

00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,750
attendance at ohio linux fest so it is

00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:26,000
like the place to be so are they early

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,130
linux specific podcast there's a little

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,809
bit of tech stuff or like a general tech

00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,760
that that's coming in and out part of

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,149
this well i think one of them might be

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,120
the the linux tech show but there's also

00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:41,299
hacker public radio linux for the rest

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,279
of us the mini pc show the saturday

00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:46,700
morning linux sunday morning linux

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,190
review linux luck cast kernel panic odd

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,110
casts by the way i like this on a single

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:55,460
board computer and virtual private

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:58,789
server show yeah very very specific

00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,860
exact so I mean someone is really the

00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,960
place to be the expo hall is really

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,570
going to be jumping all the booths are

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,870
taken might have to put somebody out in

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,510
the hallway but it's a it's a really

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,760
good show to come to and it is so cool

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:16,669
I'm so happy that it's in the hyatt

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,500
because one of the issues that we had in

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:20,540
the past is that

00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,240
you could get lost in the expo and like

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:25,850
forget to go to any of the talks you

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,980
know or or you know it's like the ohio

00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,480
linux fest was like so spread out you

00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,700
know that it was was it upstairs

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,190
downstairs which hallway was it in but

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,500
but now now it's really going to be able

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,590
to jump in and get the maximum amount of

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,800
time the best you you loo utilization

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:46,610
your time is going to be at the hyatt

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:48,860
and it'll be better for for your babies

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,140
and strollers and people that can't walk

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,480
far and older people that they can you

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,980
know shoot up to their hotel room yeah a

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,480
lot easier I've actually been in the

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,000
facility at least the expo center

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,860
facility early this year for the Arnold

00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,810
that was in town I guys have every year

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,210
out there yeah it's pretty pretty

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,590
incredible I it's the I'm probably one

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,140
of the biggest sex both things that I've

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,460
ever seen it was not just a ginormous

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,700
and I've been to the one in New York

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,860
it's just insane up there so all right

00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,390
thank you awesome and if you'd stick

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,360
around against more news and awesome

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,100
things here for the rest of the show and

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,420
for them won't let the chilla chilla you

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,850
got some business real quick i will not

00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,640
go for the podcast or all there are

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,460
others on the linux ohio linux or site

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,010
or is that is there a way to find all

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,870
those podcasts um easily no we haven't

00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,030
we haven't put anything up about then

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,950
yet we actually this is just today we

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:43,370
reckon fortune we found out about this

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:46,780
so this is hot off the press okay cool

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:49,670
definitely I definitely man yeah awesome

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,900
alright Sheila you got a so it looks

00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,700
like something I might be recommending

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,520
in my next intro to podcasting class so

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,420
you went Wow let's hold the phone oh no

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,400
no so um and I think we talked about

00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:05,090
blueberry port we talked about blue very

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,250
briefly um I think somebody was using a

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,540
blue microphone I was just using one

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,620
yesterday snowball yeah I snowball yetis

00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,380
that's usually what i recommend for

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,100
pocket new podcasters so blue Blues come

00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,110
out with a couple of microphones

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,100
recently in one most recently I saw

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:24,560
announced today is their blue raspberry

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,050
microphone not the color blue but the

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,790
company blue and then the mic is kind of

00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,880
has a red not to be confused with

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,120
raspberry pi stop using raspberry as we

00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,170
were

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,340
talking about that no relation I'm sure

00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:40,100
the thing that the thing that caught my

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,560
attention quickly was the device is both

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,220
USB so orcs with pretty much any

00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,380
computer i'm sure linux as well and iOS

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,280
so i thought that was kind of cool the

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,900
other thing that I really liked about

00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,420
the device is that it actually came with

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,260
its own attached stand and kind of folds

00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,310
up compact it's a little bit it looks

00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,510
like it's a little bit thicker but

00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:02,750
actually a little bit more narrow than

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:05,180
the size of the average cell phone so I

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:07,400
thought that was pretty cool and then

00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:12,100
along with just it being a microphone

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,630
and hooking up to any iOS or USB device

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,310
it has it has a lot of extra features on

00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,860
the device it has a headphone jack for

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:21,380
monitoring volume controls right on the

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,170
side gain control on opposite side to

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,230
adjust your input level the gain knob

00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,210
can actually be pushed in to mute it if

00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,820
you need to I thought it was pretty nice

00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,310
it has it has a diffuser on it supposed

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:35,210
to help reduce any background noise I

00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,250
think this is one of those things if

00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,260
you're if you're on the go or your your

00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,210
kind of have your own mobile podcast

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,010
unit know whether it be a laptop or

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:48,350
whatever type of device iphone ipad etc

00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:51,110
android device to me this seems like it

00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,360
would be the device to get the one thing

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:56,030
that was that definitely caught caught

00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,410
my eye is it does start at two hundred

00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,430
dollars oh geez but in the realm of what

00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:08,090
it does i paid 150 for a lightning

00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:09,530
integrated USB device so right two

00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,760
hundred dollars for what it does isn't

00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:17,270
bad i definitely want to throw this to a

00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:19,190
starter unless they have i'm creating

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,410
type money i'm really curious to see how

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,660
well it works because this is like like

00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,160
you looking at well that's not lined up

00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,490
right you're looking at the use cases

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:31,520
here and it's uh you know they're

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,130
showing it really like away from you

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,950
like nobody's talking into it or

00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,300
anything like that right like that it's

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,920
sitting on a desk at seeing in the

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:44,390
middle of the room and i'm curious kind

00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,950
of what the the it's not the ideal way

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,470
to record is it more for

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,549
recording I need to hear some results

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,570
from this I'd like to hear some results

00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:52,190
the one thing that interests me in the

00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,000
picture was they had a pretty pretty

00:33:52,190 --> 00:34:01,070
interesting setup where they had an

00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,169
iphone on a stand on a mount mm-hmm and

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,120
then it was wired into the iphones could

00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:08,839
actually use it as a nice a good

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,399
external mic yeah while you're recording

00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,950
like in the one that was like you have a

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,450
teleprompter sitting there and a DSLR

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,879
and the distance and it's more like kind

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,379
of closer to them again I think it's

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,579
going to be a better thing but I think

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,829
you're still going to get a little bit

00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:24,200
of room bouncing you know off of

00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:25,339
something like that again it being a two

00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,020
hundred fifty dollar mike maybe that

00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:28,280
begins it is a little better about being

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,349
directional and a little bit of that

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,609
distance or something like that so I'm

00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:35,030
really curious to hear some results for

00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:36,530
this definitely so certainly but check

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,820
it out so two hundred fifty dollars if

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,740
you want to check my rocks two hundred

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,260
bucks I'm sure I'm sure might be a

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,339
little cheaper on I'm perhaps amazon or

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,970
something like that but it's an

00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:48,409
interesting little option for that I

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,119
don't know I don't know if this is what

00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,919
you want for a podcast though I think

00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:54,319
this feels like something you get for

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,149
dictation but then it see it feels too

00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:57,560
pricey for something like that what yeah

00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:59,839
i'm gonna i'm gonna guess this is

00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,579
definitely targeted at the podcast it's

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,410
not it's supposed to sit on your desk

00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,900
doesn't really attached to there's no

00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:09,680
attachment for a mic stand it looks like

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:12,380
maybe um other than once built in there

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,329
I know it might be standard no actually

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,069
no it looks like if you look at it looks

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,300
like kinds yeah there's a little it's

00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:18,980
got little screw thing at the bottom

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,500
there like like that would be a standard

00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,180
kind of mic thing so that could be a

00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,970
possibility I'll be interested to test

00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:31,310
it out alright my awesome thing so so I

00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,930
had a plex server setup I talked about

00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,599
here on the show a few months ago right

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,089
I ripped all my dvds all these things

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,660
all these guys all got ripped thrown on

00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:43,819
a drive synced it up with plex streaming

00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,220
things happily to my my phone in my

00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:48,260
chromecast and never really got around

00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,390
to setting up my apple TV really great

00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,230
get there really arean smite EVD

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,359
collection right then the drive failed

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,300
then the drive failed you Jameer it I

00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,880
did I what did you mirror the drive

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,430
well it had not entirely gotten up into

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,170
the back blaze thing and of course I

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,750
mean about 200 bucks to get the drive to

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,890
get what was backed up on there

00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,930
thankfully diskwarrior is pretty awesome

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:16,580
and it did let me recover my files off

00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:18,740
of it so there that was okay but one way

00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:20,300
that I could have this just announced

00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,060
this past week they could have avoided

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,200
this entire problem and chill i want to

00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,060
show you just because i realize a shot

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:30,350
wasn't set up so so look interesting in

00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:33,320
the corner there please plex cloud means

00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,580
saying goodbye to the always-on pc cuz i

00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,310
mean this is always like you want that

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,960
extra pc or you or a computer you maybe

00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,970
weren't using all the time so it could

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,800
sit there in process and and and and

00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,060
traffic cop things right good because

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,980
the one thing about clucks that i think

00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,400
is pretty cool to your point sit there

00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:51,800
in process plex does transcoding doesn't

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,500
it you know if your device doesn't

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,810
native isn't natively able to watch the

00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,210
way you encoded your video it will

00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,720
actually re-encode it on the fly and

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,790
stream the encoding correct i believe so

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,800
i believe so yeah I think that's pretty

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,640
cool for I know some people that encode

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,330
blu-ray quality and that uses a

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:16,610
higher-end benq format i think it is

00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:18,170
which obviously you're most of your

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,090
android devices aren't going to work

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,930
with out of the box you can use things

00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:24,980
like VLC good Open Source Initiative

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,570
your Apple devices are going to have

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,420
some problems so i add Plex is

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,740
phenomenal mmm and it runs on linux and

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,860
there's there's other options have come

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:36,590
up about like a DVR if you you hook up

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,780
an OTA and over the air antenna to it

00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,370
which I was looking at is a maybe option

00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,230
for this now you have to pay for it and

00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,340
it's it's it's connected with Google

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,750
Drive is a 59 99 so you'll grinding out

00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,850
this up you're going to have that have a

00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,750
your Plex pass which is five bucks a

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:55,340
month or forty dollars a year or ANT+ in

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,860
addition to that your amazon drive

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:01,040
subscription which is sixty dollars a

00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,080
year for unlimited storage mind you so I

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,700
mean it is I mean it you're looking a

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:08,060
hundred bucks a year if you get the full

00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,490
year things but that but still now when

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,810
you're traveling and just want to watch

00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,010
that movie you'll have to worry about

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,780
okay is the connection

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:18,110
I'm this going all the way my home is my

00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,780
home the laptop the mac mini reset

00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,410
because there's a storm and and all your

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:27,020
stuff is now accessible on there on the

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:29,900
on the Amazon Amazon Cloud so I think

00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,300
that's pretty cool Plex is really doing

00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,600
a lot of stuff to upgrade lately and and

00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:38,330
really kind of become in that great um

00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,370
um you know media center everywhere for

00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,840
it for a lot of people i think so that's

00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,060
pretty cool i haven't i've yet to pay

00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,420
for blacks because is i have not had

00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,130
much need to but this could be a pretty

00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,980
interesting thing as i look at all my

00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,740
online options i am sitting on both an

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,900
Amazon I'm sorry a Google Drive in a

00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:59,320
drop box that I paid 10 bucks each for

00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,910
for space for sharing files so maybe

00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,960
moving stuff the Amazon and doing that

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,850
but I don't know how great they are

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,630
above all that stuff yet but we'll see

00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,010
we'll see it might be worth

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,830
investigating if that means that I get

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:12,950
to kind of roll this into there as well

00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:14,540
in the long run so definitely some very

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,180
interesting objects and to me their

00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,940
support is just phenomenal with they

00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,890
definitely went out after every market

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,020
possible that their client if you looked

00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:27,290
at their client support list though so

00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,240
they support tivo windows sonos they

00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,760
have a browser-based version home

00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,230
theater pcs smart TV so I actually have

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,260
a I have a flex app on my on my samsung

amazon fire TV PlayStation 4 Xbox one

Android TV Nvidia shield Apple TV Roku

windows found krause you can pull out

00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,280
that old phone and start using it you

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,680
got a plex app Android & iOS so there I

00:39:52,280 --> 00:40:00,440
can't think of any devices really that

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,860
this doesn't run on which i think is is

00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,110
is is a telltale sign of the the effort

00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,740
they put into this mm-hmm he's awesome

00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:11,840
if you get plex pass um all right so

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,910

experience haven't over entirely into

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,920
this um but I don't know if you can look

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,350
at it in the in the chat as well chilla

00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:32,780
so I think I saw a story a breeze by me

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:36,560
while waiting for the thing the load but

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,610
yeah a big a VR experience that yeah i'm

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,560
gonna go to Utila make you look this is

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,420
what I got I know it's it this is this

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,960
is the first hand experience of what it

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:52,160
would look like to be on Mars kind of 3d

00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,260
you know in 3d you know in VR that

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,570
they're they're lettin students get into

00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,080
so it's pretty cool is a little bit

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:02,000
behind the scenes there as well so no

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,580
that's pretty fun you can go to field

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,040
trip to Mars com to get the video about

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,380
what exactly they're doing on there so

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,490
this isn't like oh that's are you see on

00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,760
are you seeing what they're doing there

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:17,240
where there is it's like overlaid onto

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,790
the side of the bus windows yes wash so

00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,580
so the it's built into the bus they're

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:25,460
using you're using these uh the are the

00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,900
other clear glass it looks like well I

00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,760
can't imagine they're totally clear but

00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,430
i think they leave you the ass that the

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,840
feeling that it's there those looking

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,690
out they look like they're there the

00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:39,470
see-through arm they look like there's a

00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,250
see-through LCDs yes like the samsung

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,080
ones i know so

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,640
people were working with that we've

00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,770
talked about before like for the pop

00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,520
machines and everything but yeah that's

00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,200
pretty cool that is and I want one of

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,170
those bus and the bus is like seriously

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,570
driving around so like in real space oh

00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,490
yeah this is that glass technology I've

00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,460
seen before yeah because the what

00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,980
happens is when you turn on when you

00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,380
Electrify these panels these glass the

00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,680
windows in here they become a pig and

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,080
then they're able to of course do the do

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,600
the video on top of it as well so how

00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,670
much do they cost what the panels yeah I

00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:20,570
have friends that will be able to tell

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:22,550
you but that's free CLE and and it's

00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,290
it's seriously like moving in real space

00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:28,610
as the bus like travels down the road

00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:30,320
and and and and it reacts to it in 3d so

00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,150
you have to go check out field trip to

00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,630
Mars calm thanks doctor I should I drink

00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:38,060
that calm for uh for setting that along

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:41,570
to us alright and we had another one

00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:44,360
come along here from juggalo John I

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:45,860
didn't get to get into this i went to

00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,650
download it and i haven't been able to

00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:51,800
boot it up yet it's called it the site

00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,480
is be candid calm is another app and let

00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,430
me get over to what he describes it as

00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,790
he says he saw it on reddit in a few

00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:01,040
videos it's a chat a chat board that is

00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,200
anonymous kind of like Yik yak but not

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,580
sure and so I was hoping I was hoping he

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,260
could have gone a little bit into this

00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,390
and unless that was she thought of this

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:16,160
but yeah it's a it's an anonymous chat

00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:17,360
board it's so their line is a speaker

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,850
mind freely with the people in

00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,020
communities that matter to you and again

00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:23,750
looks like just kind of drop it into

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,130
some interesting topics and do that you

00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:30,080
do sign up with facebook so i don't know

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:32,420
how anonymous that's gonna be so um but

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,810
yeah it looks like oh you know again

00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,430
kind of a a destroyer way for you to you

00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:39,290
know let us know what you really think

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,490
because you know that's what we need

00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:44,840
more of here in this election season um

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:48,200
somebody said that they thank you thank

00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,810
you election for let me delete thirty

00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,990
percent of my facebook friends from one

00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:58,530
of them

00:44:51,990 --> 00:45:01,140
um we had some really interesting stuff

00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,220
lined up this week I saw something I

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,850
thought wasn't no from chilla but

00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:11,010
realized there was a note to myself of

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:12,330
course the the the debate was was last

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,530
night I was trying to look for a

00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,000
different word because I'd been making

00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,030
fun of it using words I used to describe

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,320
Monday Night Raw but I did I did jump

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:24,000
into a little bit of it um because I I

00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,360
didn't have the app on my on my samsung

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,520
gear vr chilla I don't know if you've

00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,640
got dived into alt space of ER just yet

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:36,570
i have not yet so um I so they had a

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,060
virtual reality um party I guess the

00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:43,020
bait watch party hosted by a virtual Al

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:47,369
Roker I did not get to see our Roker but

00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,840
it was pretty cool um it was it was

00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:50,340
interesting because you drop into it you

00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,490
say hey I want to watch the debate and

00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:56,609
it drops you into this space that and

00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,290
I've been to like you know 30 rock you

00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,410
know rockefeller plaza and all that

00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,210
stuff they drop you basically into

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:04,740
rockefeller plaza at night and you look

00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:08,490
across and there's a giant screen and

00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:11,760
debates play so i virtually walk myself

00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:14,820
over there this is my motion for walking

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,140
myself virtually over there and we're

00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,050
like click over there or whatever the

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,400
case may be but it it was interesting

00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,109
anyway so I went over there's a few

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,100
people watching it and then I got turned

00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:24,630
around because one of those things where

00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,460
I'm sitting and I couldn't really turn

00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,100
around to move anywhere else and I got

00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,520
stuck in a corner as I as I end up doing

00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:35,190
in this program um it was interesting it

00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,840
was really interesting again just kind

00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,540
of checked it out you know for a couple

00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,330
of minutes but I also felt like why was

00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,619
it so low like it was there it was in

00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,780
front of me it got louder as I got

00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,630
closer but it wasn't really loud enough

00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,950
to really listen into and then there

00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,960
were like some people there that were

00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,490
like talking to each other because I

00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,109
think you can turn on the microphone and

00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:58,950
like straight talk to people in a real

00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:00,960
space too so I don't know how much of

00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,390
that really worked out or anything like

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,819
that but but it was uh it was kind of

00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:09,269
interesting interesting use of the space

00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:11,789
seeing that we're at that point where

00:47:09,269 --> 00:47:13,289
they are I mean the debates you know a

00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:15,749
year ago was the first time where they

00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:17,130
did like 360 video I think like the

00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:20,039
Republican debates or something like

00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:21,839
that and this to actually say hey

00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,900
virtual how Roker is going to show it up

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,489
and be the host of your virtual debate

00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,930
watching party so NBC is not shy from

00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:34,099
starting you know trying stuff like this

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:37,109
so I think it's pretty interesting know

00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,969
how useful it is I'm still trying to

00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:40,680
figure out all space VR I'm like kind of

00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:42,690
afraid to go into it you know cuz it's

00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,359
pretty much second life in virtual

00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,709
reality you know and I know how weird

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,729
that gets and there's like that the

00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:50,640
stuff we were talking about in here

00:47:47,729 --> 00:47:52,319
about the virtual bubble that so that PB

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,019
cuz people would apparently like because

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,150
you moved by pointing in a spot and

00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:59,569
clicking and you basically warp to that

00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,769
spot you don't actually walk anywhere um

00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:03,690
so you could do that and just jump in

00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:05,489
front of somebody's face like I saw

00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,619
somebody else I was like one avatar was

00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:10,229
inside the other one and just completely

00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:12,089
violating its virtual space and so this

00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:13,920
is this is a social problem right and

00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:16,469
they're trying to solve that as well so

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:21,119
all right so uh one more you want to

00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:24,029
touch on before we get out of here um do

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,759
you want to do who do you care who buys

00:48:24,029 --> 00:48:28,559
Twitter or do you want to do i do care

00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:30,269
who buys twitter cuz i kind of like

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,359
Twitter and I don't want Twitter to go

00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:34,949
to be did the fall apart or they'll

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,449
already because so so one of the things

00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:42,180
that was it was in the news today that

00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:44,549
that Disney is talking to its

00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,949
accountants and whatnot and I'm sure

00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:50,009
there are legal teams about should they

00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:52,229
buy Twitter I'm not sure that I want

00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:54,059
Disney owning Twitter well okay here

00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:57,900
here's how here's how I look at this so

00:48:54,059 --> 00:49:00,630
we have verizon trying to belt by yahoo

00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:02,699
already owns AOL we have they buy

00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,739
everything that's old after it is just

00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:08,390
repeat and gone it's it's like that

00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:12,119
their daughter media yeah yeah exactly a

00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:16,229
comcast owns NBC universal comcast

00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:18,989
whatever owns like a ton of streams as

00:49:16,229 --> 00:49:19,740
it is Disney I try not to think of

00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:24,080
Disney is do

00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:26,880
the anymore disney is ABC disney ESPN

00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,270
etc XR right like disney isn't the

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,550
mickey mouse company disney is a comcast

00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:34,770
universal at this point right like like

00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:36,330
I keep forgetting a man ABC's getting

00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:39,680
all these Marvel shows and it's like

00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:43,350
within the same company now you know um

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,720
so don't think Mickey Mouse is buying

00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:47,460
Twitter I don't think of it as Mickey

00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:53,820
Mouse buying Twitter what I worry about

00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:55,910
is is it going to taint my some of the

00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,140
advertising I don't even mind reading

00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,240
because they do a pretty good job of

00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,970
curating it I would say they're above

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:08,100
and beyond even what I see from facebook

00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:12,990
as far as ad curation I worried would my

00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:15,690
timeline turn into advertisements for TV

00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:18,960
shows advertisements for movies very

00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:21,330
isn't already yeah but it's it's it's

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,390
across every where is it going to be

00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:26,970
more tainted to the Disney realm I don't

00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,100
know I that I've heard Google's looking

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:32,850
at them I would much rather see Google

00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:36,510
make a run at Twitter and help somebody

00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:41,760
who is also a online media company right

00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:44,730
not a rooted in old media yeah it's this

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,320
just I don't know it would be

00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,050
interesting to see what happens because

00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,830
there's there's also a dirty underground

00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:54,359
the Twitter that that what are they

00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:57,720
going to start to clamp down and really

00:50:54,359 --> 00:51:03,930
start to moderate and I don't know it's

00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:06,869
just I find it troublesome indeed and I

00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:09,119
am finally relegated to the idea that

00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:11,430
Twitter as I have known and enjoyed it

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,790
for nearly 10 years may not be Twitter

00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:15,810
much longer yeah it's I I wonder if it's

00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,750
going to be one of those things that

00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:21,210
this buyout is going to push people to a

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,670
different platform and I don't know what

00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,490
that platform is going to be the I

00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,080
theatres room for it because we have

00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:29,460
haven't you know most of the social

00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,140
media that people are using these days

00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,540
aren't they really kind of the old hats

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,750
now like your Facebook your Twitter

00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,910
read it and then nothing's really taken

00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:43,650
hold like a Google+ that's fried mm-hmm

00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:47,280
I I think it is I don't know what that

00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:50,030
is and it feels like things aren't like

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:55,200
things don't start up and get this crazy

00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:57,630
um this crazy a flood of people like

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,050
used to with twitter facebook snapchat

00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:03,210
you know things like that Yik yak you

00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:05,400
know things that kind of come and go

00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:07,590
periscope meerkat maybe the closest

00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,470
things I could think of so what is that

00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,850
Twitter Facebook thing to to replace it

00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,400
not what does that look like I'm kind of

00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,170
curious or is it just as Twitter and

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,260
Facebook just missed steps so hard we

00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:21,090
clamor for something else in sometime in

00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,470
the near future like I don't know Disney

00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,700
buying it and deciding that it's going

00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:28,020
to stream football to us without us

00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:29,550
asking so yeah you never know all right

00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,730
real quick other stories that we hadn't

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,140
lineup that did not get to as we have

00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:35,640
been doing just to have an idea what we

00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:40,830
had an idea what was interesting to us

00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:42,920
for the week oh we did not okay we have

00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:45,630
to talk about this real real quick

00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,750
snapchat change his name and they have

00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:50,130
spectacles this is for real i seriously

00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,540
had to check my calendar make sure it

00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,540
wasn't april fool's day when I read this

00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,150
article is anybody else seeing this i

00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,710
have seen this and I I'm not gonna lie I

00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,900
didn't get to watch you're gonna wear

00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,280
those look at those what does like how

00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,990
this kind of specs you'll wear chilla

00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,090
they're they're definitely interesting

00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:10,980
looking guy didn't see a black pair that

00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:12,660
was not as rough on the eyes no there he

00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,750
goes as a lot of the color yet to me

00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,640
that wasn't that bad I think they're I

00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:19,350
think at least google glass thought

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,130
about people that actually wore glasses

00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:24,150
and had no prescriptions is the snapchat

00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,520
doesn't care you're not cool enough to

00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:28,230
wear these yeah and you better gone by

00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,350
contacts if you were glass yeah I want

00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:34,710
to you yeah I find it to be interesting

00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:37,380
but I find it to be obviously the price

00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,850
is a lot lower mm-hmm about 150 bucks is

00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,670
a hundred thirty a hundred thirty bucks

00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:45,920
yeah the thing that I don't like is they

00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:48,680
only work with snapchat and you get at

00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,750
second recording a video because of

00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:57,319
snapchat because it's snapchat right I

00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:58,910
feel like I should be able to grab X

00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:01,280
amount of time and then take it on my

00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:04,520
device and clip it down or or do

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,530
something along those lines and of

00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,030
course then you're going to need an iOS

00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:12,319
or Android device with a tooth

00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:14,210
connection or Wi-Fi to to allow that

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,410
transfer Susan fans do you see

00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,540
yourselves were in some of these you

00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,680
know give me this will finally if you're

00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:22,700
not already get you on the snapchat

00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,400
bandwagon oh yeah that's not quite my

00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:28,670
fashion sense I don't think that's who

00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,520
should buy Twitter snapchat you know

00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,599
actually if anybody maybe maybe I don't

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,280
know if they have enough money for it

00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:35,930
but I'm feeling that price tag has been

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,180
going down and down so I think it's

00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:41,720
interesting it is kind of like the mini

00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:43,220
google glass idea it does one thing I I

00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,290
don't know I'm kind of curious to see

00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:48,500
how people react to this so well i

00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:52,400
snapchat changes name to snap ink in the

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,079
process of doing this so okay its one

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,599
way to monetize I guess alright other

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,520
queries that we did have in the rundown

00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:59,960
but did not get to today YouTube go is a

00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,540
new app for offline viewing and sharing

00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,859
that's cool or the new YouTube's keeps

00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,119
coming out with new things all those

00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:07,160
weird cuz it told me that didn't have

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,650
YouTube red because I had I had I had

00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,940
since I had my trap my thing had ended

00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,339
but it's like it's part of google music

00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,960
where are you doing so hello awareness

00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:17,839
today youtube heroes will help keep

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,579
websites comments clean this is

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,339
controversial i'm not going to get into

00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:24,589
right now basically it's kind of taking

00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:27,200
advantage of people that are moderators

00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:28,520
on youtube i think from discussions I've

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,890
been hearing square is trying to fix

00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,720
chipped cards speed problems this is

00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:34,400
amazing if you get a chance go read it

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,349
and I hope it forces competition in the

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,950
market and all these are the show notes

00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:41,690
will be linked on our show posting

00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,030
awesome cast net so you can check out

00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:45,920
the links to these linked in learning

00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:49,220
arrives to build build out your skills

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,230
section they did by um Linda training

00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,059
lynda.com a while ago so it's probably a

00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:56,030
role in for that hydrogen fuel-cell

00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:59,030
train offers pollution-free rail trips

00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,690
I'm a big fan of taking the train is the

00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,329
remedial

00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,290
did note 7 still a fireball raced this

00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:05,030
is the ones the ones you're talking

00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:06,800
about where they were they're keeping

00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:10,450
them from charging all the way no so

00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,579
actually someone got a new refurb clean

00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:16,250
okay device and it caught fire this day

00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:18,650
they bought it a fireball risk though

00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:20,990
like all ER they exist it's a bit too

00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,910
flame at a ball of flame in your hands

00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:23,869
they get more explodey this time no I

00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:26,780
don't think they're more explodey

00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:29,329
they're definitely there's a question of

00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,890
is it really fixed and are they still do

00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:32,450
they continue to be and who will choose

00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:35,630
facebook / slack and will Microsoft

00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:37,609
answer back clarify so Facebook is

00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,010
releasing its version of slack in the

00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:42,829
coming weeks it will be open to all

00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:44,359
companies of any size it'll be free to

00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:47,960
try I thought that was kind of an

00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:52,310
interesting thing and it will have its

00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:54,470
own chat for your company and it will

00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,359
have all of the features or a lot of the

00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:58,460
features of Facebook the interesting

00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:01,750
thing that I find out about I find about

00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:05,630
this this concept of Facebook trying to

00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:07,790
to to compete in a slack space people

00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,700
were very familiar with how Facebook and

00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:14,030
Facebook Messenger work which could make

00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:16,990
it a very easy transition and especially

00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:20,660
when you get into the larger companies

00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:24,380
people want that familiar experience I

00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:27,800
could see companies trying to adopt this

00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,170
I know Microsoft has has been talking

00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,089
about their skype for business

00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:34,700
persistent chat competing in the slack

00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:37,640
space and they have Yammer that kind of

00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,720
competes in that social media twitter

00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:43,220
facebook space for enterprise mm-hmm

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,800
Microsoft doesn't to me have a cohesive

00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,810
story right now things are still they

00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,270
integrate together but they're separate

00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:55,280
components I really think Facebook could

00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:56,750
could push slack a little bit and what I

00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,980
think is going to be interesting out of

00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,780
all of this is I think we're going to

00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,400
see a massive amount of competition and

00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:05,990
I think the products are only going to

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:09,380
get better alrighty from the chat room

00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:11,060
Jojo John to our Twitter disgusting says

00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,560
I follow a lot of porn stars so if they

00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,370
stop them from posting nudes I'll be

00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,410
upset

00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:16,990
so putting that out there from nikki's

00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,430
going to take away your news says Kraus

00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:20,720
yes John we did talk about be candid but

00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:22,970
again I haven't been able to dive into

00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,260
it a lot so hopefully get a kt into it
