I am very pleased to introduce our

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,179
keynote speaker

00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:14,360
Tara's Balrog is the founder and CEO of

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:17,820
the open and Hamas group which is a 100%

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,570
open source monitoring project that

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,289
assumed responsibility for in 2002's

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,349
maintainer what many of you may not

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,689
realize this is Morris's third time

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,260
speaking like this but it's the first

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,780
time female we're very pleased to have

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,239
event as a keynote because one of his

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,149
earlier presentations is among the most

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,700
popular in Linux best history I remember

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,230
folks filtering out the door because

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,309
there wasn't room to stand in the room

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:54,989
tortoise is going to be talking about

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:58,289
the history of open NFS and provide

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,780
examples of how you can apply the

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,600
lessons he's learned running the company

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,180
and starting your own business please

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:15,869
give me a big hand and a warm welcome to

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:18,930
Torrance high with expressed I have a

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,409
very soft spot in my heart for these

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,200
companies

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,670
I am also painfully aware that I am the

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,030
only thing standing between you and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:33,180
Peter so I am hoping that I can make

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:34,799
this is an interesting interesting why

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,890
couldn't it you know really this is one

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:54,000
of the first conferences I ever spoken

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:58,969
I'm Carolina everyone was all excited

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,860
because Ohio business like there are

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,020
guests so we actually littered a van and

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,530
came up here there's a great time and so

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,239
I love this conference and I hope they

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,239
were maybe three colleges and I used to

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,930
come on do something special and if all

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,909
the talks I've ever given the one most

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,099
people are interested in is how to start

00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,840
an open source business because it's

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,489
like okay you're selling free software

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,469
you know how you do that how do you make

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,810
and so this talk has never been given

00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:37,469
before and probably the be the last time

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,319
I ever get but I wanted to go over the

00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,480
history of my company and kind of give

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,889
you the background on why I got started

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,989
in it the challenges we face so I hope

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,970
you guys find an interesting now I call

00:02:48,989 --> 00:03:05,519
this a brief history which was coming I

00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:12,120
wanted to do something really quick so I

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,919
said I do a brief history and so there

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,349
is no irony you still in there

00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,349
we just had a bunch of like really good

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,669
anyway before we get started I McGee so

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,290
I don't want to define some terms so

00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,299
that's what if we our communication is

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,150
based upon mutual standing so let's

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,939
let's talk about what I mean by a free

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,540
software so everyone has probably seen

00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,919
this free software Richard Stallman was

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,769
instrumental in producing what are

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,870
called the Four Freedoms and basically

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,519
if software the meets these four

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,220
requirements is considered a free

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,349
software now the downside of the free

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:07,019
software definition is words like in

00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:09,060
freedom to sue or freedom number three

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,470
you can give the whole community a

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,699
chance to pass that's communism we're

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,260
not a communist country in that

00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:22,680
communism so a lot of people's over this

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,500
idea free saw that just well the number

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,320
of other people

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,290
and they determine they came up with

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
what they call open source software and

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,580
they came up with the open source

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,540
definition it's much long there's ten

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,520
items instead of four in in some ways

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,340
the open source definition is a little

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,530
more free than the free software

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,840
it's an if Express that says you can't

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,180
discriminate against fields you can't

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,100
discriminate against who run so you

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,610
can't say oh it's free software unless

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,340
you're a defense something like that now

00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,520
you only use open source and free

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,050
software in different situations and I

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,390
just want to say for the purpose of this

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,290
pop open source is free software I'm

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,390
going to use both terms interchangeably

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,300
now a lot of people in speaking those

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:16,000
same free software is it adds a social

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,310
justice it's that help your neighborhood

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,860
and when I'm going to argue the open

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,250
source is more commercially business the

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,470
free software is more but I just want to

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,960
say for the purposes of this

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:32,440
conversation we are going to talk about

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,820
how to use both energy and it comes

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,520
important when I'm talking about making

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,950
money in an open source or free software

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,850
business because you can't really sell

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,070
the software open and if you're doing it

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,590
over the core or something like that I'm

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,290
not here to talk about that back in the

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,840
day like you said I'm open source all

00:05:50,290 --> 00:06:04,450
the bugs are people and it really

00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:06,220
bothered me because I chose so to talk

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,140
about where I got started I started into

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,729
color call back when telecom and data

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,910
call were actually separate in

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:16,000
disciplines I know this now it's going

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,620
to eat snack baby stuff but I was

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,750
actually one for going to talk home and

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,660
I always got involved in the how we take

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:26,320
this latency switch manufacturer get

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,479
connected to this new thing called and

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,289
so I ended up doing network management

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:36,330
very very early in my career and by the

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,330
middle of 1990 90s

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:43,590
um I was doing a lot of software and

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,870
these words he felt like they say the

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:56,700
Internet is forever but really these

00:06:45,870 --> 00:07:00,870
logos I had a lot of tools from Cummings

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:05,070
like each and I never sold I can't close

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,290
the door much less a deal but I love my

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,330
job was after the deal was done I would

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:13,290
go into finding all these disparate

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,970
tools to work together and talking to a

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,300
lot of glue back then we had this

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,240
language called pearl and we were right

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,400
about these pearl programs to tile this

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,290
stuff together and it was it we can

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,230
really have change control we didn't

00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,870
have this often taken for granted and so

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,640
let's say I might a little tool that

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,640
would say I'm looking at the device in

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,710
HP oh I can pull up the Conklin that

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,780
were calculators the performance data on

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,070
this thing and it would work fine they

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,470
told hock work came out with a new

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:50,700
release and they were adding new option

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:53,160
to whatever command so very so it's

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,450
frustrating from the glue stick and it

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,370
was also frustrating from the

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,700
functionality standpoint because I might

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,700
be using I use medical and it's like

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,420
make my life so much easier but there's

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,610
absolutely no way to see together and on

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,430
top of it I once did a might reduce

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,250
installation when the license fee was

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,900
1.1 million dollars so the thing about

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,640
this you spend one point 1 million

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,150
dollars and you get it email with some

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:28,620
numbers you don't have McLaren f1 you

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,900
get so many people with some numbers so

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,340
some people ideas and acquaintances work

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:40,200
for this company called your eye and

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,570
they were the ones behind this mess the

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,760
idea was we're going to make it open

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,760
source version of all

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,699
this glue and you know we can tie all

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,639
the Catherine cheeseburgers in a costume

00:08:57,699 --> 00:10:00,819
ball when I work with HP tools they

00:09:00,639 --> 00:10:17,560
would say for every customers okay I'm

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:19,300
driving to work so I got to work watch

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:26,800
the Towers fall and then we just want to

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:29,860
do so so it wasn't exactly the best just

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:36,870
on business but we persevered we manage

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,870
and started in September by May of 2002

00:10:50,069 --> 00:11:14,470
so I can was you know pcs once I have a

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,490
friend who had a vc software company

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:21,760
five million dollars bank statement and

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,380
there's the insurance even at point one

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:31,779
percent or whatever you get from the

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:33,430
bank it was you know I can make way more

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:40,980
than that if I just invested somewhere

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:40,980
else this is I'm good until you run out

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:58,389
what I do you know the copyright release

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,860
on open source they can't change their

00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:07,420
mind but they can say all from here on

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:09,670
out no remember I got into this for the

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,920
pretend it was a business thing look

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,720
eight dollars four dollars you know is

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:22,180
this makes business sense so I went to

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:25,529
Steve Jobs who's the CEO of his watch I

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:30,790
said hey throw out my cable Friday

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:32,170
that's Chi servers in Russia that was

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,959
easy but show of hands how many people

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,519
remarried

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,069
well if you're the sole the major

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,920
breadwinner in the household and you

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:44,889
decide to create your job and so free

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:52,380
software you might want to discuss it

00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:57,069
with the decisions like this are a

00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:00,670
decision and not eight we celebrate 25

00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:06,610
years in April so we managed to so

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:08,470
anyway selfies my way so name of the

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,170
company was sort of the sort over

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,230
exactly was it named after my father I

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,629
harvest

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,459
and so I register it's worth over and I

00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,949
made sure that didn't mean like you know

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,279
monkey but it's of your language they

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:29,490
were who had open it and that sounds

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,490
like openness so it's like you know it

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,529
was for someone who didn't have any

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,920
graphic skills whatsoever I meet a

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:44,350
little guy fourth of July that hat was

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,639
like red white blue so I created my

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,209
website now pretty software is free

00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,589
theoretically you can sell it what

00:13:51,209 --> 00:14:06,459
because you can there's nothing that

00:13:53,589 --> 00:14:08,680
says hey it's usually some other

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:14,699
business like services and in our case

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,699
it was support people don't buy support

00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,139
so one of the first things I did this is

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,829
all from Clark I thought were ever to

00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:28,089
take this outfits but the thing is I

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:29,310
ties and so here you have you know we

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,389
have our standard support subscription

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,060
installation support from a little blog

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:36,310
and we have crisis and then also the

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,670
same thing for consulting and animated

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:43,930
funny names like you know for wanting to

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,189
get started we my project would say what

00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,209
we're going to say to people fresh out

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:49,839
of college and will pretend to

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,189
understand complex business and then

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,809
they little write-up we record about it

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:57,459
and it's going to be about 50 grand work

00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:01,839
crafts all these paragraphs the truth of

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:03,430
the matter is 95% never forward but you

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,870
going to do with privates analysis

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,220
someone came to two thousand dollars and

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,959
say here you go here's your fan support

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,769
line great where's my network management

00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,660
solution Oh with death analysis well

00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:17,069
what's that there's a woman to take you

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:22,240
requirements know what an analyzer and

00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:24,370
again same situation two weeks and what

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,990
we found is that look we can address

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,750
ninety-five percent

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,400
those means in a week it's like we show

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,960
up where you can figure open the image

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,860
to show you how to use a 20 inch network

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:39,280
do discover and qualify so in show up

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,170
it's a week in it include support and

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,660
notice on both of these I think you know

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,780
so this monitor but I have custom

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,300
support and custom consulting and that's

00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,010
where a lot of our business came from we

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:57,070
would because I think we want to do this

00:15:51,010 --> 00:16:00,940
and we go okay this is what I never sold

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,010
a chocolate help and it was an idea of

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,190
because we people weren't in consulting

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,450
their company you have to process well I

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,310
think she helped me solve that problem I

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,990
love you about ten dollars okay well now

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,550
I've got an issue here on I said well

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,140
she's getting twenty thousand dollars

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,090
and I'll give you twenty hours or

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,700
whatever came the kitty and then you can

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,710
just build will just use that stuff and

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,070
I never really did that but the idea was

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:26,310
let's go ahead and product I as your

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,930
service

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,390
now you notice here I'll say discount

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,120
now cut off the top of this for

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:38,530
nonprofits schools stuff like that I

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,830
offer discount because when you're a

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:45,130
services business those organizations

00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:48,250
will work you as hard if not harder than

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,750
your other customers and informatica

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,010
it's like I'd like to give a break to

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:57,040
schools or just can't because it's going

00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,510
to cost you as a services company the

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,100
same amount of income for workers so

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:03,130
everyone pays the same we publish our

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,760
prices online because a lot of companies

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:09,490
will have buyers who can incentivize

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,070
what kind of discount and it's really

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,510
hard to say you don't keep because I'm

00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,810
not going to penalize you for being

00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:20,230
large and because it's from my

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:23,440
standpoint cell network the final thing

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:27,160
about this these prices are considerably

00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,050
less than what we charged now part of

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:34,060
that is open it message stations over

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:36,030
it's a way more power but the other

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,930
thing is never

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:42,000
class do not under value what you're

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,970
doing you're doing it before to stop

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,590
you're providing value to companies and

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:53,900
that's why you know we can you know H be

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:59,460
a fraction Bobby should still charges

00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:06,060
and so I always told Peter but don't

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:19,050
don't be the bargain basement okay

00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:22,970
marketing planes in elevators once I

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,500
have you over the nest a bike on shape

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:45,150
now I travel a lot for business so

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:47,310
occasionally like you're making some

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,190
kind of statement it's like you know so

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,890
you never stop your being here you know

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:59,430
I'm not here to sell you guys but that

00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:02,220
is now you freeze and look at it but

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,900
anyway do it a bunch of lightning

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,810
postures before this if someone said get

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,580
involved go to your love speak do them I

00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:13,410
mean that's one great way of market the

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,900
other thing so in my analysis of

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:19,290
successful software technology Union is

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:23,160
one thing that you need when you start

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:26,370
off a sugar daddy so work could be brown

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,910
sugar mama you know the ideas I love

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:33,360
this picture I just thought but the idea

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:37,290
is when we started we keep one customer

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,600
who was kind of written it so venomous

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,430
and they paid for a lot of custom

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,530
consulting that's got a callback

00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:46,980
spaceman imposing they're actually a

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:48,999
sponsor of this Collins great company

00:19:46,980 --> 00:21:01,419
and

00:19:48,999 --> 00:21:04,719
I have a friend who is also because the

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,789
first thing a complex language D this

00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:10,839
site that says who you are what you do

00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:16,689
and how to contact that's to this day at

00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:18,099
the bottom we're possible we assume

00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:19,989
you're going to be working with some

00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,849
sort of code either glue that you might

00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,379
do together a bunch of other open source

00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,269
projects ordinances were finding

00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:27,489
yourself back in the day we had this

00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,009
thing called source for now it's good

00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:31,569
just everybody get up if you want

00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:36,789
contributions they're going to be on

00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:40,569
care of bug tracker you can use github

00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:42,219
we use JIRA but you want to tell the

00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:44,289
ticketing system if you do support

00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,269
something that you can convince your

00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,509
customers can open tickets and you can

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,759
track we use request traffic which

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,429
before Twitter was real easy to find you

00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,819
just Google are key but if you who are

00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,720
team Howard bus driver did not show up

00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:03,610
and there's other ones like OTRS

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
systems you might want to bail that's

00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,789
one of the things we're struggling with

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:13,120
right now is we have a number of mailing

00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:15,490
lists and a number of forms and because

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:21,240
the forum's can send you a mail when

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:25,600
someone updates and there's out there

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,799
and and so you gotta worry about that if

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,620
you want some way that you build this

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,059
and have sort of record if you want

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,740
Google to index it so you're not always

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,640
answering the same question over and

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:43,929
over accounting so we started open a

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,880
mess we didn't have new cash from my

00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,610
understanding new cash is quite an

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,780
accomplice darlington bounces police

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:55,480
prickles so critical is online it's

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,520
cheap its online I hate the fact that my

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,230
financials are in the cloud but now that

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,320
we have many more employees who need to

00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,940
see reports and stuff like that teachers

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,740
that's the one piece one of the few

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:11,080
pieces of there's a CRM system

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,900
I think as I'm here now because we it's

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,490
just starting out it's the time to start

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,010
thinking about these things because when

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,289
you have 100 customers adopting this you

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,000
are a system is okay because you've got

00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,620
a migrated day then you've got to dig up

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,380
then you've got to find it we switch the

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,669
sweet syrup serum from Sugar CRM and it

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,400
was a bit of a pain because every

00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:32,860
contact every customer we can made you

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,799
know we had to migrate back so you want

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,659
to start that I'm necessarily day one

00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:44,080
but toward the beginning when you're not

00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:52,600
so big and social you need a Twitter

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:54,280
account I'm not on Facebook but I did we

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,049
are setting up a mastodons are really

00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,880
Mastodon users so there's a guy who got

00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:04,270
me into a lot of Linux trusted Kevin hi

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,250
mr. ipv6 and he was like you know NASA

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,059
gonna capsize the lives you gotta spin

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,059
up a server so

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:29,770
you're talking about community so here

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:33,580
in him basically a company 2002 I live

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,809
in dying I think it so we have that

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,669
openness RC channel

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,669
yeah we've migrated to a total matter

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:47,110
money and so we have a gateway so a lot

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:50,919
of these open Internet - chat things is

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:54,490
just the talking

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,470
they are detail but I do a lot of stuff

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,730
on our security mailing list this is

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:05,649
kind of your no longer school on any

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:09,240
eggs remediate from this list I develop

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:12,010
a ton of features because a lot of

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,090
that's smart geographically dispersed

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:23,159
and just kind of hard for some people

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:23,159
because like the way from home another

00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm going to the Lugg meeting I'd stay

00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:41,110
like two hours in the parking lot

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:47,200
talking I know they were just a handle

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:49,480
on what I said it's some way to

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:55,029
recognize these people contribute over

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,649
their best and so I admit about the or

00:25:55,029 --> 00:26:01,390
gurgles they've gone to her which is a

00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:04,510
British banker and I crossed it with the

00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,250
idea of closures what needs to sell like

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,110
blackened by publishers well this idea

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,419
came to me in April or the Masters

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,740
Balter I'm not a golfer but at least

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,750
three miles of home and watching the

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:20,890
golf tournament I was pretending like

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:22,860
that isn't it like my life well when you

00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:26,760
win the Masters they give you a picture

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,760
so I came up with this idea

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,650
and someone I think once I reached out

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,010
to these people I said hey I'd like you

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,390
to become active members of project

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,420
green polo shirt that define change

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:44,310
everybody else at the urgent and looking

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:48,000
at my cell address and I forget how many

00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:50,310
written an initial initial urging people

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,470
seconds and so these people were

00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:57,750
donating here maybe started we're able

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:08,910
to me and I was like for someone who is

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:11,310
a 1 this was important so this Def Jam

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,990
our developers sampler game so either

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,660
one an old farmhouse and I said okay you

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,310
get to its rural North Carolina I'll

00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:23,700
pick you up I'll feed you and we'll just

00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:25,290
spend a week and so every year now we

00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:36,240
have the Developers Conference so here's

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:40,950
a picture of several and the word repo

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,170
if you're a member you end up in Frank

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,980
the company will pay you they will pay

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:48,660
your expenses it's there to leave and so

00:27:46,980 --> 00:28:10,350
it's like wow I thought Christmas it's

00:27:48,660 --> 00:28:11,670
like we like to now at some point it's

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,290
not unless you make the conscious

00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:15,420
decision of being a company of one

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:21,000
there's nothing wrong with that at some

00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:27,510
point I'm and I got to hire it was 2004

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,850
this business partner David Eustace and

00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:31,440
that's the commercial company so gonna

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:37,260
miss that call that's the commercial

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:40,940
company behind behind the paintings now

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,940
the beautiful part about hiring

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:56,130
that's how ordered someone's how to iron

00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:58,380
so the time came to hire I've hired is

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,990
irony as easy save the decision to

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,090
decide the hire sinister once we can

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:07,280
hire somebody I like to hire on infinity

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,280
because these guys did this for free

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:18,510
it's like eating ice cream sundae

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:20,070
finding my callback 2015 and I kind of

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:29,090
talked about it when I was going to

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:31,380
school I graduated college in 98 and

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:35,730
Mexican anyone was kind of a weak year

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,790
for jobs and class who had jobs on

00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:41,150
graduation it wasn't Microsoft support

00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:44,700
were people who had internships or coops

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,800
but is there's a heavy person I look to

00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,440
whether you've done and if I met your

00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,840
candidacy whatever well I have a b-plus

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,210
a pinch and I took these courses watch

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,800
it and another guy comes up says well

00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,570
here's my give up and going here's my

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:05,280
kids here's the stuff cuz I don't care

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:12,150
what the course of you talking what some

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:14,250
guy was saying that there you are do you

00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,200
know lightning talk and it's like didn't

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,080
have a great idea that we had a

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,550
corporate my own hands I recognized all

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,950
Reynold country and we were sitting

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:30,180
around I want to make sure here unless I

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:33,510
didn't know then again and I knew what

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,310
they could do based upon their output in

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:38,100
the story arc that owned a fish would

00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,150
fund this topic as we ever got were

00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,130
Christian calendar

00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:44,940
I don't under used to live in Caracas

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:48,510
Venezuela and Caracas is more dangerous

00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:50,400
than Baghdad you could Google that

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,710
there's a few people who tell you why

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,639
they think drivers he was commuting two

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:57,450
hours each

00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:59,369
well it's been four hours you got

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:06,659
involved with open in this became ogp

00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:07,979
flying to dead and I just paid off put

00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:11,879
money in the bank account you deal with

00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:13,799
the taxes United States probably you

00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:16,139
know that worked out we hired a lawyer

00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,469
without an h-1b he got given carolien

00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:29,940
into the country as of March then you

00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:33,179
have there been point to that it's a did

00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:37,019
and it was all the cause of sleepovers

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,690
or song so I highly papaya so okay

00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:43,109
that's all the good stuff

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,849
let's talk about next okay I'm talking

00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:51,329
about scored I've told you stories time

00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:52,109
individually but so I used to be a big

00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:54,589
defender

00:31:52,109 --> 00:32:05,309
so I started rubbing internestor

00:31:54,589 --> 00:32:12,839
2002-2003 who started making from happen

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:14,429
there and something called os10 so when

00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:19,829
they announced the 12-inch PowerBook

00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:26,219
Obama and so we had and so there was a

00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:30,409
small interest in and one of my guys Ben

00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:33,089
we he was a big apple guy so he ported

00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:36,119
problem was at the time Jaguar was out

00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:41,369
and it only supported the Chavo we're

00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:44,579
not over and we required $1 because it

00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:47,099
just didn't work okay we needed certain

00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,749
things so I was very good so at the time

00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:51,809
unless you have a developer's license

00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:53,789
you couldn't get a job you can't kind of

00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:55,999
waiting and so we get generally

00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:55,999
available

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,220
here's the one thought one thought

00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:13,600
boathouse well I mean having 1.1 product

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,950
right of it if you read that it's

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,950
actually the version of the installer

00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:24,880
about what they've done is we moved all

00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,100
of the code that required what about -

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,910
and kind of created their own version of

00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:36,750
open events and I was like so I talked

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:39,250
it's kind of Mark Murphy and I said well

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,860
the first thing they did was let's take

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,530
these guys as performing but hey it's

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:47,200
wonderful that you are interested in

00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:50,020
packaging over there that's ten we just

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,670
have problems we'd like to work out you

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,740
inside what version you're running

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,120
could you use our discussion of this

00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,710
adventure own discussion lists that's

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,300
all under the project of the products

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,990
that are up and let's just say it wasn't

00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,390
very nice it was obvious it's open

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,980
source I do whatever I want and I kind

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,800
of pointed them to most airlines a nice

00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,139
little back on on may or why you know

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:18,669
Firefox binaries can only be built by

00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:21,820
Mozilla that's why on business reason

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:24,159
head back world check out their version

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,320
of oh it's bad news on the first page of

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,090
Google open Internet and they had

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,460
checked out this and it didn't work

00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:34,389
because it required John what about two

00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:38,230
bones we fix that would be damaged or

00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:41,020
lacking well there is a way to protect

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:43,090
yourself is called pain so I'll register

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,370
your trademark bender coach this guy

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:54,700
again once we got my paperwork and said

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:56,710
hey and he still wouldn't you can

00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:02,170
actually go and there's enough stuff

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,820
online that'll tell you and then we did

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,670
the first time hired a lawyer with open

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:10,570
MS was to do a cease and desist letter

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:12,040
to miss Murphey guy and and that felt

00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,770
that was a big loss there was a failure

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,109
on my part but cause it would be nice to

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,200
capture this guy but it just wasn't

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:21,440
happen and you guys are score

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,680
that happens in open-source projects

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,859
there are Forks and there's reasons but

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,980
for us the importance of trailer so if

00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:34,020
you decide that you really do a product

00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,369
get the timeline because that is a

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,890
marketing thing it's one of the few

00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:39,710
things you own as a creator of open

00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:47,250
source software that you can control

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:48,930
exposure yeah yeah I mean we filed it

00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:56,960
and we have prior art and other stuff

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:56,960
like that too but yes we now hair long

00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:16,170
but I didn't use lawyers when it started

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:19,589
I operated on my history involves

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,630
company policy so I love the IRC channel

00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:24,690
one day hey you need to check out the

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:27,690
city or watchtower pop and I've looked

00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:32,069
into the glass fight area saw Formica

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:35,010
oh we're going to take them out no look

00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:44,099
at it so I'm sort of looking at it so

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:46,829
this is from that era categories we

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,200
found out that sitio took open in this

00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:54,089
maybe proprietary product out of it my

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,950
baby philosophy now at this time CEO had

00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:58,829
raised both I'm millions of dollars from

00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:01,800
the BC notice continent except I had to

00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:04,250
do something and the first thing I

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,050
learned is no one cares

00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,760
now karin-sama had to leave because the

00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,020
Jewish High Holidays but karin-sama

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,579
would probably disagree with you what

00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,579
the what we think it says in Kansas

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:18,569
but very few people I just don't care

00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:19,800
businesses don't care so violated but

00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:22,530
there is one person who does spears

00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,200
named Evan Coker there is a software

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,329
freedom Law Center so I contacted it and

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,339
I said hey help myself

00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:32,970
what does it take I want this to end it

00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,760
turns out

00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:40,400
whether as in their charter they are not

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,660
able to they not able to represent

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,180
for-profit companies we are anymore

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,930
father company so they founded the

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:56,460
company called Oakland and we were their

00:37:48,930 --> 00:38:00,300
first claim and sign my case was so

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:07,260
there's a nice little little pioneers

00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:12,720
so Evan code calls up Jaime Lerner sue

00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:17,160
you need to fix this continue said we

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,960
were violated I killed knock your code

00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,640
we knew this was a truth it's quite

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,630
improved and gave her like a four person

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:29,490
coming then some you don't think that

00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:31,920
you don't own that copyright you know so

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:34,770
I started doing some research I can then

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,300
closed his doors in 2004 its IP bounced

00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,790
around and ended up through this company

00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,109
in New Jersey called ferritin probably

00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:46,109
most known for remote keyboard access

00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:52,980
services so I contacted merit and said

00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:54,630
hey turned out rare exam was being

00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:02,400
investigated by the software freedom Law

00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:07,500
Center for violating very slightly but

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,369
they so I spent a year of my life acting

00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,920
as a go-between

00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,180
but because because of fun there was no

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,210
way that any moment could represent

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,089
Raritan and the soccer field Law Center

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:20,670
in the lawsuit for this conference so I

00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,250
spent a year getting their conflict

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,470
resolved and then ever you couldn't work

00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,440
so once that happened everything with

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:31,140
everyone's work in city inputs in sports

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,780
so before we get a settlement or any

00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,670
anything in that matter city it was it

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,650
or they almost because I'm reading on

00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:42,930
the the forums like people just sit them

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:45,560
renewals or software licenses and then

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,560
they sure took the words

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:52,249
check there's no B course but one of the

00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:54,200
things that came out of this is I'm not

00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:55,640
a very smart man but when I wrote the

00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,859
agreement between us and Raritan

00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,450
concerning any future settlement I put

00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:01,789
in if we get a settlement from city of

00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:05,720
rare attendant give us the copyright

00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:08,059
open it mess if not greater technical

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,160
sell us

00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:12,019
so David my business partner and I we

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,690
mortgage our houses and wrote a very

00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:16,579
large check Raritan and we've got the

00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:21,769
copyright open invest and they might

00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:29,089
like to use like royalty-free license so

00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:33,170
we brought all now copyright is a big

00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:35,809
thing with in copyright assignment

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,019
things like this so I did what any smart

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:40,519
person do by the time I said I ordered

00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,690
the Greek poet of mainland I said how we

00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:43,579
gonna handle this because if this

00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,640
happens in the future is almost over I

00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:48,980
don't have to go after it

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,739
indeed it was the one who suggested that

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,329
we adopted some countries there's now

00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:56,480
other world

00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:58,670
but the idea is that people come from

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,009
so if you contribute code for the

00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,450
project that uses this you assign

00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:05,390
there's two steps first of all you say

00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:08,029
you have to write to the code which is

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,239
an important both mental step and see

00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:14,539
why a step because it's like sad like if

00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:17,599
you didn't even there's anything was

00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:20,930
copyright so the opening this oh this is

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,519
one percent mass but if you write it as

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,519
a code there's nothing preventing you

00:41:26,289 --> 00:41:31,339
it's kind of likely to go off by a bulk

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,650
the two I'm gonna try to work well one

00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:38,269
of them to write a sequel and they were

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:41,049
right to use those characters it's the

00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:48,309
heroes hasn't improvement in court but

00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:50,180
no court cases so copyrights important

00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:52,730
so you've got a point

00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:55,099
I'll talk about hiring l100 River well

00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,309
eventually got here they're kind of like

00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:03,369
that again I didn't use anything I

00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:05,150
we were starting out I manually BigTable

00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:08,359
service they're actually quite cheap

00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,160
again I'm very stingy so I was like okay

00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,449
I'm going to do payroll this is kind of

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,979
the examples I could you possibly

00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:15,489
payroll because I'm going to do it once

00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:15,489
every thirty days

00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:31,059
there's only short by like two days

00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:39,079
anyway just put this a go and service

00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:40,249
okay but you for those of you don't know

00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:42,890
there are there are things called

00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:46,219
trips Rovers and they will they will

00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:47,989
look at your needs figure out shop and

00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:49,910
they'll handle all this so talk to

00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:51,859
anyone else you know on small business

00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:55,519
find out their insurance broker it is if

00:42:51,859 --> 00:43:05,269
they like them to use when it becomes I

00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:08,630
had one of my employees Jeff juice so he

00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:11,989
found one at Costco I would be the

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:15,079
opportunity for exclusive pricing for

00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:18,489
customers so we literally signed up our

00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:20,390
Olentangy with your builder via console

00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:23,479
because it turned out to be like 70

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,880
bucks a month and we figured out so

00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:28,279
again think about you you wanna offer

00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,660
things like how many people oriented

00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:36,890
business so I wanna make sure they're

00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:44,229
happy and and the idea is I find

00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:46,369
interesting ways so I'm winding down so

00:43:44,229 --> 00:43:50,420
people will come up to you and they'll

00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:55,400
say you gotta have business and this is

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:57,079
usually a business plan this is

00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,469
important know what you're gonna do are

00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:02,509
you going to do services and integrating

00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:05,809
those her projects of advantage of opens

00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:10,599
were part of yourself the business plan

00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,599
we came up with was really ready to

00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:16,470
you could have my 15 years so I'm

00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,970
spending less money than the earth now

00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,650
we have plans for how we will be moving

00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:25,060
the future and things like that that are

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:27,940
somewhat formal but there is no joke but

00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:42,790
the reason is you know what you want to

00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:48,070
do is never do this well with that

00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:52,420
interview I just want to say and then

00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:54,490
worry about it hey listen I talk about

00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,690
payroll for the first year of my life

00:44:54,490 --> 00:45:00,130
and I was on 80 percent condition so

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,010
basically anything that came in the door

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,260
and I had a $300 month less dependent

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,170
you know anything that came or I gave

00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,840
myself 80% and the other 24 samples with

00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:14,320
payroll taxes and incidentals like my

00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:18,040
cell phone and in the entire first year

00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,950
of my business we spent $5,000 so it is

00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,950
possible I can spend less money then you

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,630
are not Southwest you know my expenses

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:27,220
committee of the travel expenses I've

00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:30,220
get back to customers they voted it as

00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:33,490
part of the products now we actually

00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:41,859
really golden in fact that you have a

00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:45,400
other options for us so what is the most

00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:46,109
successful what was worth coming Thank

00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,010
You Brandon

00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:49,750
whether this was actually started

00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,700
because we're in Raleigh right us on

00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,750
Raleigh and ribs and Raleigh he was kind

00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:57,490
of his idea what it does I read that

00:45:54,750 --> 00:46:01,510
last about two years ago we had adopted

00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:03,880
the Red Hat bottle for over the mess one

00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:07,690
of the problems we ran into was it was

00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,599
taking us about 18 months to do a major

00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:12,430
release and part of that was you know

00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:14,440
our business was important so real

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:17,380
cautious about adding any kind of new

00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,000
features or doing I break that I ruined

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,950
our customers things and then you would

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,440
have to support say some of the

00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,000
attributed something that used

00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,400
ecology we weren't while you're with

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,109
well these people aren't waiting so I

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,819
can't like oh the customer just thought

00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:32,609
you weren't a pic Colin's got a picture

00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:36,750
pod you notice I have to have this up in

00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:41,430
here and plus I found out people are

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:43,200
willing to pay for stability and so we

00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,359
kind of adopted the redhead we came out

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,780
with both a domestic license so YC is

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,569
always moving and that was the idea that

00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,130
was our I don't we call communities but

00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:56,250
that was the cutting edge of its all the

00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:58,440
new features in the first year that we

00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,800
did this first 16 months we had five

00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,710
major losses so we ended up taking the

00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,829
18 month release cycle down to three to

00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:10,290
four which was here because we ended up

00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:13,170
putting so many features is no been in

00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,670
the best for company now prior to that

00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,050
we used to have a stable reads and

00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,750
production release and we did the whole

00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:21,359
kernel old colonel thing so back to not

00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:23,970
four not six that was stable about 3.5

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,430
that seven necklace development nobody's

00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,740
about so quite frequently we would

00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:32,640
release not flexible enough to make me

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,140
upset we would release something in 24

00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,020
hours later being this Madagascar

00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:41,280
Cochran have two things and so we came

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,780
up with so what we did was we said okay

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,720
we're gonna have why is it which is the

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,849
cutting-edge police and then one have

00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,160
Rhydian and Marie nearly gets released

00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:55,410
once a year and it well major releases

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,510
and then we basically take cherry-pick

00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,790
all those features we think are stapled

00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:02,099
back its breathing and breathing is a

00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:05,069
suppression service people paying us to

00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:07,500
access to cut now we publish it under

00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:09,510
the age you know I left the whole

00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,950
licensing discussion out of this but we

00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,050
ended up licensing over there Russell

00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:19,920
could be a pharaoh GPL which is about as

00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:21,660
copyleft its way out there we have some

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,420
customers really big customers that

00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:29,099
having ruled you came thou shalt not put

00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:31,980
any a GPL software in the system so we

00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:33,510
also made it available license this

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,870
right here license was written by a guy

00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:40,790
named Aaron Williams who also used to

00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:43,680
another great dive and it's the hele

00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:45,690
but we don't call it the AGPL recently

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,560
but it's basically the same rights if

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,670
you check out bring it you can share it

00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,740
speaking Brennan I had this intercom

00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,240
this sin cos test when I was doing a lot

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,270
with open court companies

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,970
I said look Sam escape help and they

00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:01,710
were binary compatible packages to an

00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,150
editor president they basically took

00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:06,090
with enter president removed all the

00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,890
trademarks recompile any movies if

00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:08,880
someone can do that with your product

00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,700
you're a loser

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,530
does it pass the cents on snacks if you

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:18,750
have something him purrsula factoring

00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:24,120
States and so I've known no one's

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:27,990
actually the same cost cent cost reading

00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,250
yet but because the idea is when we

00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:32,270
place it is you get access to our

00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:35,070
repository if you think the prices and

00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,930
that is we just make it easier for you

00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,080
because they release it doesn't get

00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,730
updated you do what releases every month

00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,400
of horizon and a lot of our customers

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,380
once it's working we won't change and we

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,990
support Veridian for three years so we

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:54,990
made great athene is important 2016 and

00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:57,720
the call was so important is a business

00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:59,490
that doesn't scale very well let's say

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,930
for a sport engineer use for paying

00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:06,180
customers well might be 10 more

00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:08,790
customers it's you know having to hire

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:10,410
people was a problem have but I've never

00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:12,240
heard this story and all over they came

00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:14,940
but there was something develop promoted

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,470
game for the Xbox it was like a

00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,280
platformer like you're trying to rescue

00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:22,350
the princess spoilers here so my

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,240
university princess but it was all kind

00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:26,100
involved and so you miss like working

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,690
backwards in time and you've got to be

00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,010
ended the games was actually the

00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:37,830
beginning of the timeline

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:39,150
utilized so like the fruit and he's got

00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:41,040
wrote this he's been out two hundred

00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:42,840
thousand dollars developers put it up on

00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,610
the Xbox Marketplace for the very kind

00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,260
of forgot about it was the meeting

00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:49,650
Starbucks opened up his bank account

00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:53,730
again because it went viral

00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:55,170
to play this game you can't do that with

00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:59,569
the non-traditional model

00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:59,569
you know I do Wow don't know yourselves

00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:12,119
we thought it would be a way that people

00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:15,450
compare what they give you money baby

00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:17,250
panting it's only the return but we have

00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,900
a couple of very different customers but

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,520
what I think they did was increase

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,490
increase our revenue from our existing

00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,900
customer which again doesn't sign you

00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,609
know it makes it easier this important

00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,799
since we've mainly support grid Ian now

00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:43,859
and so it's a more stable race when I

00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:48,119
deal with these now because people how

00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:50,490
many of you use WordPress I'm a bit kind

00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:51,839
of WordPress 2/3 I won't work best and

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,549
then that's called those the five

00:51:51,839 --> 00:52:03,020
minutes long basically so a database

00:51:53,549 --> 00:52:06,500
Daddy user you swap the tarball and I

00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,500
have four blocks

00:52:06,589 --> 00:52:11,640
well there's wordpress.com and it used

00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:13,319
to be that they hosted pretty much the

00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,760
same kind of it's like for $10 a month

00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,400
over there you can have your block those

00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,799
200 and they'd up with the backgrounds

00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,940
in the updates and if you wanted to do

00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:22,289
press the button it could dump

00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,500
everything gallery to button on your

00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:27,349
engines and so I think you can be true

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,720
to your open source lose

00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:32,819
offering a posted for as long as you as

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:37,109
long as your customers have the ability

00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:40,289
to somewhat easily migrate to a private

00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:42,029
life and I think that's a big selling

00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:43,799
point I think people or we have

00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:45,660
customers right now we're moving toward

00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,339
an open and a message of service if you

00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:49,049
will model but they're dancing husband

00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,180
one customer that we were monitoring

00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:53,700
they're open investing time and we call

00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,319
them up as a hater boxes down and they

00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,930
said oh yeah the hardware failure we're

00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:59,190
not gonna replace it and they're like

00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:02,000
and we're like what don't you get -

00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,000
James as well

00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,770
No and what they wanted to do is now is

00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:10,020
they won at all time and so we're

00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:12,059
working for the cloudy version of open

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,410
the mask which is going to accessible

00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:18,240
again getting feedback from your

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:19,589
customers but you know this is right

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,359
because it's allows you to scale

00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:22,589
I can't wait to listen but like one of

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,240
the things we do is when you've said in

00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:26,700
essence you cracked it open and imagine

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,099
open investors know what is it generates

00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,690
an unformatted Bank I can't wait till we

00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:32,760
have unclear users generating this

00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,040
unformatted the banks then go forward

00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:39,079
and then we use continued delivery to go

00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,079
out and roll these things out so then

00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,750
backups all the water problems doing the

00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,880
paper now I'm mixing the business plan

00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:52,109
we also have to have mission statement a

00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,559
formal summary Microsoft business things

00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:59,849
for a long time was a funeral very death

00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:01,050
now the other you know our mission

00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:02,790
statement is something a little

00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:07,020
different because we came over this way

00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:08,670
how customers have fun okay we're not

00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:13,020
we're going to be the paradigm shifting

00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:14,609
synergy building markedly because we

00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:19,290
boil the damages first of all I'm going

00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:21,990
to help your customers listen if you can

00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:25,559
have fun and help your customers you

00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:27,930
will make money and one of the things

00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:31,200
that really bothers me about the tech

00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:33,030
industry today is the fact that on very

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,980
rare cases a couple of geeks get

00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,020
together they widen happen there's some

00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,119
of the builders and now everyone thinks

00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:44,460
it's all about them or he's a builder

00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:52,319
come and if you focus on your money if

00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:55,140
that's your reason it's like so I have

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:57,660
this picture here and then this guy if

00:54:55,140 --> 00:55:05,700
this is taken from 2007 or Steve Jobs is

00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:09,089
holding up the original I didn't set out

00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:14,000
to make Apple the most valuable one of

00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:14,000
the most valuable companies in order

00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,840
we're not a fan I will hold for them I

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,100
just like modern happy but if I pull the

00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:27,300
phone out of my pocket or the phone

00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:29,970
about that did an exhibit about this

00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:32,610
other thing those folks had keyboards or

00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:36,210
something like that revolutionize the

00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:48,390
internet now my mom can work but he

00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:48,690
didn't again have fun and the money will

00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:51,360
come

00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:53,870
trust me I'm constantly surprised with

00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,870
me actually

00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:07,640
so how was your day I do want to point

00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:16,140
out just so no one thinks I'm violating

00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:17,730
that is a it's a very place for I did

00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:40,020
not take this picture someone said but

00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:44,970
when you paid formal definition do good

00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:48,210
things has worked for me and I want to

00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,830
end this talking about doing good things

00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:54,900
how many of you versus smile about

00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:56,790
Amazon yeah using you know amazon.com

00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,070
they had this thing where you can smile

00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,530
but Amazon that you can choose a charity

00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:04,410
and Amazon will give a really small

00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:08,310
amount of money for every purchase you

00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:11,070
buy and my purity of choice is a soccer

00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:12,360
field service they used to be yeah that

00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,670
until I found this offer read

00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:19,350
Conservancy was I wish you could split

00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:21,720
it is just that remember to go in switch

00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:23,820
again is long and I'm kind of sad that

00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:27,410
I'm responsible personally for more than

00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:29,330
10% of all the money there's gotta be 30

00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,190
well use it

00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,770
I see anything all you gotta do is

00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,720
remember to get a smile on amazon.com

00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,520
and on the final note I want to talk

00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,160
about supporting this conference because

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,220
I have had a blast seeing one of these

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,560
support the activities they painted they

00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:48,050
should be doing their busiest badge

00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,030
because that's why we're here but if you

00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:52,610
support if you can't support this week

00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:54,470
we have money but we don't we don't have

00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:56,480
enough to feel like a platinum sponsor

00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:59,540
or anything I said they owe a lot 500

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,920
bucks so I said you know be fiber about

00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,870
we don't even want any recognition they

00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,370
were kind enough to put a sponsor on

00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,230
their website but that's it you know I

00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:08,270
believe in you guys know I think for 500

00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,580
bucks here's 500 bucks and he also

00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:13,790
sponsored the raffle so there is a

00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:16,580
raffle with lots of old things and Beth

00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:18,200
Ling has done a great job about bundling

00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,330
all the things together so they're

00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,520
actually cool so if you know about the

00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:25,070
rapid-fire raffle tickets you do not

00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,230
have to be a president that they will

00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,820
test you and he will need to apply

00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,720
within a certain amount of time before

00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,080
someone else

00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,300
whatever your what I bought what we paid

00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,490
for was my coffee in the box

00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:39,370
even though my craft so if you want to

00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:49,430
talk to you later about how far more

00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:51,530
Alexa and echo I'm in 1984 before I pop

00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,930
this open source project not lately

00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,700
is it ready for primetime done it's kind

00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,370
of fun though but what I found that is

00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,660
you take a Raspberry Pi 3 burn this

00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:02,170
thing called Pycroft

00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:04,610
onto a micro SD car hook up a jammer

00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:08,660
combination speaker than a microphone

00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:10,430
and you've got anyone there's one change

00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:12,440
everything go to my youtube channel you

00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:14,570
can find it and there's just one small

00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:26,750
change everything to get it to use the

00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:32,870
speaker on the USB instead of anyway

00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:35,120
that's it this is me adventures got a

00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:37,520
lot of adventures in OSS colonies my

00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:40,930
office was blah I'm a few other belongs

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,930
so you're gonna toss a tire

00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:47,910
slash planet that's kind of a excess

00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,910
speed with all of my my clothes

00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:59,670
[Applause]

01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:13,089
we're running a little over but let's

01:00:10,509 --> 01:00:14,049
take a couple questions if you raise

01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:17,940
your hand

01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:23,140
I saw one hand who's the second hand

01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:24,039
well start with the one not escaping

01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:33,099
play yeah

01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:42,730
oh here for you bags but talk to me

01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:46,029
about your toughest failure in a

01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:50,069
heartfelt this is us I just finished it

01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:50,069
do not pinch this is us but it's like a

01:00:50,400 --> 01:01:06,150
2009 we made her bags I think I was

01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:10,150
joking about the fork length bed about

01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:13,119
um you know you work with people they're

01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:15,700
not your friends at least another source

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,609
and to have to actually call somebody up

01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:20,380
and say you know I made a mistake and

01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:25,900
for the good of the company I have to

01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:34,450
let its pain and so that's it so we did

01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:35,859
two big firm layoffs because I said look

01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,339
we're going to do this and we're going

01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:41,079
to do this once I never let anybody have

01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:45,150
to be able saw the doors before I landed

01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:47,519
ago and and so far we did fine I need

01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:49,869
but that was probably the hardest part

01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:54,430
of the job and you've gotta sometimes

01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:55,840
make decisions and I don't mind

01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,730
there's only a handful of people I've

01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,420
had to fire and say you're not working

01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:16,900
out but to take people wow that I just

01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:18,400
cook so so the statement is for those

01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,590
who you can't hear is apparently local

01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,070
Chamber of Commerce's will will let you

01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:23,070
get good coverage

01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:31,300
do you tell me what you want the group

01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,980
you ya mean because then it becomes you

01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,320
know there's no preconditions it's

01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:39,040
basically you know what HR you here's

01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:48,100
how much you take an open mms I pay 100%

01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:50,980
of the employees is dreadfully important

01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:54,100
to my business and so in the we got just

01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:56,290
got a new insurance program like yeah I

01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,850
said we don't cut you can get pre-tax

01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:01,780
for spouse and family but for the

01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:03,550
individual we pay 100 of their cream and

01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,260
we also had spousal support long-term

01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:06,970
disability and all that stuff it took us

01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,790
a while because if you just start out

01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:11,830
loans let me give you one for this bill

01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:13,600
but it after why can't any once you get

01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:15,850
bigger it actually the rates you know I

01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:28,210
am painfully aware of the cost of

01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:30,010
pumpkins and it's something you can go

01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:34,120
this is for one camp can you do for own

01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:35,980
case because I looked it up because I

01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,860
had to dig that graphic out looks like

01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:57,640
there's like an old presentation but

01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:59,460
yeah but the other thing is you have an

01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:03,750
idea of where we want to go on long

01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,750
focus or effort but

01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:12,460
you've been pulled because open source

01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,730
opens itself up to a lot of unique ways

01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:17,619
they directly I never felt leaner

01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:19,540
because when I was working with Mike

01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:21,790
reusing stuff I remember once Thank You

01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:25,900
America I said I never told the story

01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:27,640
before because I did work for Bank of

01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,460
America before they were merged with

01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:35,109
nation thing and they want complement

01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:37,720
work I play a $500,000 instance I went

01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:42,780
up to work on I went to California we

01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:45,730
make their way into the park and I

01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:48,819
realized like two hours in for their

01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:50,710
need they bought the one product that I

01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:55,050
didn't sell it but I worked really

01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:58,960
really hard to make the product in

01:04:55,050 --> 01:05:00,640
hiring I'm go to Lowe's or Home Depot

01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,369
and I can buy the same pipes and

01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,260
fittings and even you know but he's the

01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:10,210
expert and he does it a lot faster and I

01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:11,800
just pay the money and and then but the

01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,470
idea is it's what I tell people I say

01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,030
you just paying for my time if we made

01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,740
this one the first customer I had to

01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:20,710
drop hooking in the support it was a

01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:38,440
hospital in Virginia call them I said

01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:39,730
hey it's like it just works for us but

01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,089
it's a good feeling

01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:49,270
I feel really clean because I would

01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:52,230
their career on a bad decision big big

01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,230
hand for tourists

01:05:53,619 --> 01:06:08,170
oh it's done here but not quite yet I

01:06:06,009 --> 01:06:10,630
want to take a brief moment to recognize

01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:13,059

folks in the yellow shirt chair for the

01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:17,230
past several years and he did so with

01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:19,989
very little notice and he turned in his

01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:22,539
resignation as Speaker chair earlier

01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:24,940
this year but opposed to just running

01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:27,489
off and saying PC you guys have fun good

01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,559

01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:38,230
reaching out to people and sorting

01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:39,999
