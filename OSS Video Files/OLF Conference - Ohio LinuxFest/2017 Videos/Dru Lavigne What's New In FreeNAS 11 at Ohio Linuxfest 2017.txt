expensive it's been a couple of years

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,529
since I talked about free nets when I

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,240
was putting together this talk I was

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,830
looking through my old free no stocks

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,269
and it looks like it's from the nine

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,850
three days presentation so today I'm

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,510
going to talk about what's in the new

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:25,560
eleven and what's coming in 11.1 which

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:29,369
is due out next month and I'll start

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,500
with a bit of an overview of FreeNAS

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,770
just for those of you they're not aware

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,140
of the features in as those of you have

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,360
been to my other pre desktops just

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,610
barely anus be those two features and

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,070
then we'll get into the more interesting

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,879
stuff so it actually being the eleventh

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,180
series and what we're looking forward to

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,340
that one

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,829
it's coming out and another month or so

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,949
at the very end of this talk I have a

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,690
list of URLs as well as the URL to this

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,340
presentation so that you can you

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,890
download it

00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,320
trust it so we'll just start with a bit

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,890
of an overview of freenas what is

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,100
freeness it is an open source and a

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,189
target app storage so allows you to take

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,869
your own hardware I can download the

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:27,930
system and you're able to provide

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:30,869
storage it is licensed under the two

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,259
class BSD license so it's for your own

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,880
source if you were to download the

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,079
latest version today that would be

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,960
Cyril earlier this year we changed our

00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,689
naming conventions slightly to make it

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,180
obvious when there has been a boost to

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:51,549
our release so whenever you see the

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,369
letter noon that basically indicates

00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:58,960
their updates and typically those are

00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:04,170
four security fixes so that you for that

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,170
we release one thing was for the latest

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,900
look not one is the one who are working

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,880
that we are now and it has one really

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,420
cool features today we're going to have

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,920
a slight RC process for that because

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,930
there are a lot of new features to do

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,950
most of the bugs shaking out before

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:36,040
release so right now October 23rd is the

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,220
date that we have for the first beta or

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:48,940
our seat and assuming you don't find any

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:51,400
showstoppers so why would I

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,680
download install freeing has what am I

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,660
going to get out of it I do so so

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,139
there's a lot of features built into it

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,690
I probably have about four slides with

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:05,319
lots of text of the features because it

00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,239
is a very feature-rich project the

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,359
biggest feature and I'll touch a little

00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:14,560
bit on why it is a big feature is open

00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:18,370
CMS as you can see from my t-shirt I'm a

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:30,250
huge fan of old CFS and having used it

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:33,609
for in my resources at the end I have

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,290
more information about open CFS if

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,870
that's a file system that you're not

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,500
familiar with to help you with some of

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:44,699
the terminology and some of the features

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,340
the reason why we use old ZFS is it's

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,650
beautifully designed for storage it's

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,449
going to make sure that your disks are

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,820
healthy and let you know if they're not

00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:57,759
and it's going to make sure that your

00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,949
data stays intact and the data that you

00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,310
actually write is the data that you

00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:08,049
serve up so it's designed to be

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,720
self-healing we also support all of the

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,440
major file sharing protocols so if you

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,380
have Mac systems or if you want to do

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,639
Time Machine backups you support both

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,830
AFP and SMB for that if you have Windows

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:28,270
systems you can easily create Windows

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,009
shares and if you have UNIX systems like

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,090
to do things from the command line we

00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:38,130
also support NFS we also provide block

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:41,410
protocols so you can use I scuzzy and

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,130
the advantage of using a block protocol

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:48,940
is it doesn't matter what the underlying

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,720
file system is you can use that as if it

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,590
was

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:58,210
it's own disk so I can create my scuzzy

00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:01,690
share and I can format it with fat32 if

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,970
I feel like it and put Windows stuff on

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:08,020
it so a lot of people like to use that

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,420
new space in addition to actually

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,660
creating shares you can still get into

00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:17,620
the system other ways so you can use FTP

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:21,550
or secure FTP you can SSH into the

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,590
system we also provide web dev if you

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,680
just want to be able to have an easy way

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:31,180
to see what your folders are we do

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,030
integrate with all of the major Active

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:43,290
Directory services so the open ones like

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:47,230
open LDAP and I yes we allow you to

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,450
easily take snapshots of your data and

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,850
to be able to replicate those to other

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,940
systems so you can use as part of your

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:57,820
backup strategy you can do that either

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,320
through CFS or through our sink and you

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:05,080
can do over a secure connection and ZFS

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,420
itself is a great way of being able to

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,940
take point in time of snapshots when

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:15,690
you're down a most like and be able to

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,690
go and restore data from that point home

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,580
still got a couple more pages of

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,040
features here for those of you in the

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,710
UNIX world we all know how much fun it

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,140
is to make a contact I can't wait to get

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,710
your users to do that so we do to my

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:37,430
front end it snapped because we're based

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:41,240
on three bsd we also have things called

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:46,430
 tales that allow you to to trail

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,590
variables on running system and in

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,570
freebsd if i want to tell it what

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,860
drivers behind today i'm editing but in

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,630
the free dance i can just do that

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,330
through a GUI until it was driver stored

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,560
we do have nice pretty graphs to look at

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:10,040
show your CPU usage your disk usage

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,460
memory usage if your disks are smart

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:17,120
aware you can schedule what test run and

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,020
when they do so we do have an automated

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,750
over system that will tell you if the

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,170
disk is having issues if a new updates

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:30,140
available if you've lost the connections

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:33,440
your active directory server so in other

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,830
words your conditions in both the GUI

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,480
and it will also send an email so you

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:44,440
give it that way you can connect to UPS

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:48,910
more features you want to do networking

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,100
aggregation failover VLAN support all

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:55,840
kinds of features built right into the

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:59,080
product last thing I'll mention then the

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,900
features one of the design goals is you

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,850
always want your data to be separate for

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,850
their operating system whether it be on

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,410
the storage that way if the operating

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:19,000
system goes belly-up and we actually

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:33,070
provide a Hardware distinction so

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:36,190
typically as our upgrade mechanism we're

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:52,090
able to do this because we use EFS it

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:54,970
will actually existing system so if

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,370
you're running you through today and you

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,310
see there's an update to you for when

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,950
you upgrade both you three new for will

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,900
shortly their boot menu so on the off

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,840
chance that something happened in you

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,910
for that messed up your system you just

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,650
reboot back to you for the good

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,680
environment there's a question in the

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,680
back

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,270
so what do you mean

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,910
yes we don't provide a live version

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:42,630
because we assume you're setting up

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:45,930
basically a storage appliance okay and

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:49,170
we also provide administrative belief

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,540
that you access through a web browser we

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,459
do provide a web show for those that

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,250
like to use the command line but most

00:09:53,459 --> 00:10:00,360
people just SSH and you're going to the

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,670
command line so I talked a little bit

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,839
about loop environments this is one of

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,839
the main advantages we get with ZFS and

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,810
we already put your operating system on

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:19,290
separate disks if you wish you can

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:23,610
create a mirror for that so if one of

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:28,890
your devices goes bad you can still do

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:31,890
the system and in the interface itself

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,230
we have a bloom manager that shows you

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,209
all the entries in there that menu and

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,690
their data and then they have things

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:42,750
that deal with the operating system you

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,890
can go in and get rid of the environment

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,370
so you don't eat anymore

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:52,079
so if you decide you don't need update

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:54,630
what anymore and you don't have to

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,579
remember to take of the environment when

00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,370
you do an update it already happens for

00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:06,870
you and as I said before you can restore

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:10,350
any version of the operating system our

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,560
update manager itself does allow you to

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,260
track different trains and my train I

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,810
mean different major versions of the

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,259
operating system so before we move

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,930
2:11 version before that was called 3:10

00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:29,829
and we still have people that are still

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:33,189
on the 910 series when they are ready to

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:35,939
upgrade to 11 they just select the 11:00

00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:38,829
train and they're ready to go and

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:41,589
because of the environments they still

00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:44,160
have their 910 system installed until

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:47,230
they take that out of it when you

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,240
sometimes will have people that will

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:55,089
report bugs and a fix has been made and

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,879
they either want to help test it where

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,829
they need it before the next release so

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:06,120
we also have a train called nightly

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:06,120
where you can go and install the night

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,350
and then you just back into your stable

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,420
system so typically we will have a train

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,240
for the release before they're released

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:24,730
right now and then recently becoming

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,339
next whatever train you're on that's

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:32,589
what the alert system will tell you what

00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:35,949
there's updates for it and when an

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,500
update is available we also provide

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,059
links to the change log so you know what

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,600
updates are in there

00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:45,220
there are release notes and start with

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,290
the next version we're also going to

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,140
start adding a readout of their own

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,990
issues

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,839
nice but this gives you a lot of

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,959
flexibility so you're aware when there

00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,820
are new updates but you can decide what

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,519
works for your environment when to

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,430
actually apply the updates and you know

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,250
you always have way back should there be

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,890
a problem with the update so it's just

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,890
sort of a quick overview for those of

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,019
you familiar with three days so let's

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:24,660
get into some more interesting stuff so

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:26,820
we're now on the 11:00 train and just to

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,410
give you an idea of what's in eleven so

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,440
the version before that was called 9.10

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,899
which was sort of the confusing name

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,420
because our versions traditionally gave

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,420
you an idea of what the underlying

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,760
FreeBSD operating system was the train

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,630
was called nine but the ten indicator

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,670
that you are on FreeBSD 10 so with 11 we

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,860
said let's just go back to the proper

00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:57,810
naming mechanism so you know there now

00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:02,640
on FreeBSD 11 and what we see is were on

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:05,850
FreeBSD 11 stable so stable means is all

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,519
of the latest fixes for that release

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,699
that have happened since the release of

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,959
three BSD 11 which was some time ago

00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,910
several months ago

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,279
so you're always getting the latest

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:22,230
drivers that have been tested as stable

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,840
for 11 and the difference from 10 to 11

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,890
there were some very significant

00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:32,310
changes in FreeBSD which resulted in

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,420
updated drivers and from the man's point

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,960
of view

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:40,710
very good drivers performance boosts for

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,480
that what speeds and that so those of

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,130
you that are still at nine ten

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
especially if you're in a production

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,220
environment we recommend that you

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,090
upgrade to eleven just for those drivers

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,070
we also got some new open ZFS features

00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:58,530
solbin ZFS uses something called feature

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:03,360
flags to let you know what features are

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,580
in and if you're interested the name of

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,890
the two new features are there and you

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,530
can google those to see what they do for

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,860
you

00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:16,530
also I'm a a lot of the sharing

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,230
capabilities are third-party software

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:22,800
and they've also been updated to the

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,170
latest you have the latest samba NFS the

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,150
GUI is based on Python so you have the

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,670
way to spy on this wall and that

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:35,100
includes all the security fixes for

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:37,230
those applications the one thing that

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,600
people have been waiting for forever and

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,870
there's been promises you just actually

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:50,130
get a new UI and so I'll talk a little

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:53,820
bit about the UI so in 11 we are staging

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:57,660
out how the UI is changing and part of

00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,090
the UI we work rather than just making

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,050
it look pretty and providing different

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,830
things which we have the underlying

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:11,490
technology is the API you provide a full

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:15,990
API plus the middleware and the old

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:18,200
version of FreeNAS anybody who's used it

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,600
before knows you can only open

00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,070
one task at a time you have to wait for

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,709
it to finish so that you can do

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:27,350
something else and this can be rather

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,660
inconvenient save you're installing a

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,399
large plugin and you basically have to

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,160
sit there for 10 minutes and wait for it

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,070
to do this thing so the new middleware

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,380
is completely asynchronous so you can't

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,570
do multiple things at a time but it

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,990
takes time to change from a synchronous

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,420
and asynchronous we work as we are

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:51,199
replacing the middleware calls we're

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:55,459
also replacing the UI calls and we've

00:16:51,199 --> 00:17:00,199
changed from a Python environment to an

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:03,110
angular environment so I'll show you a

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:06,919
couple of pictures and to show you the

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:10,970
work is but if you go in now on a free

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,559
has 11 system only go to log in there

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,290
will be a little thing that says demo

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,510
we're all coming me right and don't be

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,640
disappointed when you do so because it's

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,559
not all the screens you don't yet but

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,600
the screens that are done that means the

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,329
middleware is complete the API call is

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,100
complete and you know have to pretty

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:33,530
even where we're using angular and

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:37,280
chirps the parts of the screen that use

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:40,250
charms are using c3 one of the things

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,350
you'll notice if you are in test driving

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,870
the middleware is it's a lot quicker

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,559
that's a lot snap here and it's not just

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:52,760
because of the asynchronous but also how

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:56,610
the pages are rendering so right now

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,149
and the old method was JLT which is much

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,029
smaller

00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:01,350
that's or so you'll find that once it's

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:06,809
complete it's going to be a much

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,909
snappier UI right now all of the API

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:11,880
calls are using WebSockets

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:15,990
but we're also reminded REST API just

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,840
like the old man where did and right now

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,000
it's very much a work in progress

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,299
probably about 40% of the screens of the

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,870
middleware are complete for our next

00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:35,190
beta in October we expect to have even

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:38,480
more and we expect UI Perry by 11 - and

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,549
that's just phase one so right now

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:50,070
anyone who's used Freitas before you

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:52,440
know it the layout is very related so

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,110
once we're finished doing all the

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,990
underlying stuff then we can start

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,070
looking at ok these are what the screens

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,240
used to look like

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:05,700
let's go and do a more logical workflow

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,750
so we're going to start shuffling where

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,549
things are

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:15,360
but for 11-1 and 11.2 it's going to be

00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:18,210
the same layout as the existing one just

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,810
with the new technology having said that

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,630
it is a little prettier this is not

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:27,870
wealthy we do whole bunch of things in

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:31,110
the upper right hand corner I chose the

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,980
free - sharks thing which is a darker

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:39,210
theme but we also have lighter things

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:42,750
for people who are colorblind the UI

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,410
itself is fully accessible so it works

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:51,600
with screen readers and it's also going

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:54,810
to be useful to use up mobile devices so

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,520
those are the goals that we have but I

00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:01,620
chose this one because we had some

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:06,180
pretty charts but that is one of several

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:09,450
themes by the time 11 to is done we're

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,160
also going to have full video tutorials

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:16,350
and documentation on how to make your

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:20,250
own themes so that's something so sneak

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:23,490
peek into thing so that's sort of the

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,920
eye candy stuff there's also some pieces

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,980
that are very useful especially when

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,620
you're serving data so we've had the

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,610
alert mechanism for ages it'll happily

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,980
send you an email

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,680
don't do that are so very flashy think

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,770
in your browser one of the things we

00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,290
added an 11-0 is the ability to send

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,130
alerts to a whole bunch of external

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,789
services and write in system we have a

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,710
new thing

00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:54,989
their services of a screenshot here

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:58,859
basically you select the name of your

00:20:54,989 --> 00:21:01,440
alert service and once you've selected

00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:04,229
the service the information you need to

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,149
connect to that service the fields will

00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,879
change so you can input your connection

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,399
info and it will automatically send you

00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:14,789
alerts there so a lot of people these

00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:18,919
days spend their time on slap pager

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:22,409
duties still very popular get chat and

00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,710
where you are healthy to add other alert

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:28,769
services so if why do you use it's not

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:37,950
there please make up above your course

00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:40,859
it will we've also added a section to

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,210
the services screen so services they

00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,009
always send the green light and the red

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,019
light so you can see what was on and off

00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:51,629
what we've added is the start on boot so

00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,239
it's very easy to tell at a glance if

00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:56,549
the system boots up which services are

00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:59,070
going to automatically start and it's

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,369
just a matter of checking the boxes for

00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:04,499
the services that you want to do so so

00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:09,479
so we've had a request for word for a

00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:11,789
long time this is a new feature so we've

00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:15,330
had jails and plugins for quite a few

00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:17,940
years now and jails and plugins are good

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,759
if the software that you wanna run is

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,799
available on FreeBSD it was basically a

00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:29,639
freebsd mechanism what we're integrating

00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,850
in now so we introduced it in 11 0 and

00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:35,540
we have improvements

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,820
one is integration with beehive and if

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,660
you haven't heard of beehive before this

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:45,500
is FreeBSD s paper laser so it's built

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:48,920
into the kernel it is very fast for

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,830
improvisor but it does work differently

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,700
than jails and plugins so you do want to

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,580
make sure that your system has enough

00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:02,420
CPU and RAM to be able to devote some of

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,210
that to VM space you can see from the

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,370
supported guest that pretty much most

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,700
any guest you want to install this

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:15,500
supported and it's very easy to install

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:18,970
any of those the version that comes in

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,990
11/0 makes it fairly easy to install

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:24,670
what we're doing is we're adding

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:28,010
improvements for configuring those yes

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:30,650
so right now there is just a new section

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:34,010
right next to jails called VMs you give

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:41,030
it a name you state how you want to

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:44,000
access it we spit out the VM the other

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,220
major feature that might into 11 0 is

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,700
we're starting to make it easier to

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:56,030
integrate with cloud services so we have

00:23:49,700 --> 00:24:00,230
had an s3 CMD plug-in for a while but

00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:03,770
we install Mineola the base operating

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:07,150
system and it makes it very easy to

00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:10,040
integrate with the Amazon s3 cloud and

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:14,720
over time we're going to add other cloud

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:17,570
providers as well and basically it's

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,940
just a matter of setting up an IP

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:23,540
address and a court by giving your

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:26,360
Amazon key information and you can help

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:32,930
be packing storage or the stuff that you

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:37,400
have Amazon so those are the major

00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:43,700
features of 11.0 what we're working on

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:46,070
for 11.1 quite a few improvements and if

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,830
you're an open CFS eath like I am

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,110
there's a lot of exciting or VCFs

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:55,880
features and there's a lot of stuff that

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:59,120
makes storage much nicer so we did pull

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,540
in the latest version of open CFS and

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,620
there have been they've been doing some

00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,030
major revamps of the algorithm and

00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:11,390
they're finding that you're getting much

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,980
faster performance the file system

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,440
itself

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,200
one of the biggest performance things if

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,410
you have ever had a large number of

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,310
snapshots and decided to delete that at

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:27,920
once that was something that would be

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:32,090
excruciatingly slow there have been

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,190
major improvements on that so deleting a

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,080
large number snapshots is much quicker

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,380
and replicating

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,160
self is also much quicker so OCFS is but

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,930
when I will work into improving those

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,870
one of the features of people have been

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:51,960
asking to get rubber is the ability to

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,780
pause or resume as well so if you're

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,850
scrubbing a terabyte worth of data and

00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,370
you need to reread the system and guess

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:03,090
what you're starting from just block one

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,250
when you move back up that's no longer

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,100
thing you can actually pause it and then

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,890
resume from where you started where you

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,930
ended off so people want that for a long

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,300
time

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,970
we are syncing with the latest previous

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:25,190
be stable so that means the first tree

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:25,190
is all caught up on applications drivers

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:34,770
the next point is interesting so weird

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:38,040
swamp is something that people wanted

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:41,700
for a while as well typically swamp is

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:44,700
an issue unless a disk fails and an

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,910
application was using that swap and is

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,279
like bring the system to a halt that

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:53,659
won't have to know because

00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:58,080
leave on your swap partitions so what's

00:26:53,659 --> 00:27:00,440
to just go there on your swap you should

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,440
be fine

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:08,659
those that are born familiar with Python

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,659
the middleware without using async IO

00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:15,330
when I look that up apparently makes the

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,700
code more readable and it's much easier

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:21,769
to bring asynchronous code which is what

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:25,799
we're aiming for in the 11 series

00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:32,339
recently priority as anybody ever tried

00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:34,799
to resilvered a large ego before that is

00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:37,769
something that can want to take a long

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,479
amount of time depending upon the size

00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:46,649
he urges and it can also become a busy

00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:50,669
system so we've added in the UI the

00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:53,219
ability to say during work hours we

00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:56,820
still there the background during

00:27:53,219 --> 00:28:03,299
non-use hours off of the priority so

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:06,269
that was still there yes done so you can

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,210
actually pick the hours when to bump up

00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:11,389
three silver priority and what days to

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,389
do so

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,130
I mentioned before that the BMS renew

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,980
and the guy who's been working on our

00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:27,880
VMs has done about four months worth of

00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:31,110
improvements to them a lot of the stuff

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:36,040
that didn't go into the initial

00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:39,040
integration with FreeNAS dealt with MAC

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,720
addresses and remit configurations so

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,870
we've got a lot of improvements over

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,970
that anybody who's tried the 11 version

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,770
if you go into B and C the access your

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:56,020
VM you're stuck at a default resolution

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:58,929
you know change the resolution we now

00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:02,530
support authentication if you do lock

00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:06,340
devices inside your sector size we have

00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:10,450
video coding there's more stuff he's

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:13,030
still trying to get in release so if

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,910
you've just tried the VM support to

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:19,860
definitely give it a go again an 11.1

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,860
you'll find it's a much nicer experience

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,780
we also have a bunch of miscellaneous

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:29,710
improvements some days more DDMS

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,840
providers a lot of people use mirror and

00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,610
glutton pools or disappointed that they

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,610
were able to just attach a device

00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:44,890
you can also use top deceive your Ark

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,780
stats are compressed and there's more

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:53,470
stuff that we're scrambling to see from

00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:56,409
get informed on one I'll leave this up I

00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,210
have a bunch of resources there we'll

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:01,980
take some questions and then I'll book

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:05,429
the last slide up which has you to this

00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:17,049
end we have templates for questions

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:18,700
questions yes so the recommendation is

00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:47,980
you really don't want to use your raid

00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:51,700
hardware so be life is a little bit

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:55,990
different so you may or may not be able

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:59,100
to use the VM solution so a lot of young

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:02,500
solutions they don't require to use

00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,700
certain CPUs and they have to emulate

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:10,000
certain calls and software B I've took a

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:13,179
different approach where you have to use

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,549
a certain set of CPUs to get the calls

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:19,600
but everything is happening through the

00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:21,280
hardware calls so it's faster and then

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,460
it doesn't have to do any software

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:32,190
emulation but it does limit you to its

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:32,190
CPUs you can use if you will

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:40,990
I've got this XYZ yeah you don't kill

00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,810
anyone you look cool that's not there so

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:48,940
you don't get where you got this and

00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:51,280
said and what you'll find is the

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,350
hardware that works with me height is

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:57,510
the same hardware that we recommend for

00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,510
storage because it's but it's

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:12,750
yeah so most of the intel awesome perks

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:16,200
and DS there we have a list which one is

00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,990
doin don't work and in our documentation

00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,700
if you go to the VL chapter it gives you

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,590
the command reap and lets you test your

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,860
cpu to see that has to require

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:36,840
extensions and also the list of ones

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:39,450
that we know yeah that's what we used to

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,080
think when we started creating storage

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:47,340
and you would be surprised the amount of

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:51,870
people that want to do that it is very

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:54,330
very big use case yes one trained as far

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,310
as before where the insula storage is to

00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,470
virtualize the storage so that they

00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,060
don't have to micromanage each disk as

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,440
their attic storage to their virtual

00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:07,200
environments otherwise the headache of

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,790
having to provision each piece of

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:16,910
storage and is being acquired means my

00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,910
big environment under 50 P ends it up

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:25,289
any other questions

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,360
yes so you mentioned you've got more

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:33,000
drivers in this you know how much leader

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:39,030
has us actually for example I've got a

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:53,270
problem where I do a lot of solutions

00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:54,650
now my last attempt 3 times which was

00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,409
months ago

00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:02,960
okay was that you know I'm using flash

00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:08,550
controllers you've turned into LSI 9211

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,040
there Dennis what I've noticed that if

00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:19,940
I'm not running a certain version of the

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:22,320
firmware PSD we'll just you know is that

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,000
are the drivers getting better anyway

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,750
there is accepting a wider range of

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
firmer now and are there any network

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,889
stack drivers were using any kind of

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,940
get those working companies yours

00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:41,639
everything yes so so LSI is interesting

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,470
so we used to actually in the alert

00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,690
mechanism telling you if you are at the

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:51,839
latest driver which was easier when the

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,629
driver names matched the actual version

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,970
and then the numbers started getting

00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:58,890
weird so we actually removed the alert

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:02,220
because it was just confusing people so

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:05,579
so now our recommendation is for your

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,500
adapter go to the website and make sure

00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:11,599
you're at the latest firmware and then

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,950
you should be happy and it's always hard

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,160
directing people where to go because

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,109
finding it on the website is it

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,970
sometimes I'm exercising itself and

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:24,960
there's just so many adapters out there

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:35,119
my body's still coming surging through

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:38,010
times of last year so yeah so our

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,220
recommendation is go to the vendor

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,130
website make sure you're at the latest

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,940
you should be good when it comes to

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,510
network drivers in that sometimes if

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,359
you're on the bleeding edge we actually

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,790
one of our developers does the

00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,560
networking drivers for FreeBSD so if you

00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,210
haven't you said that's not supported

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,130
