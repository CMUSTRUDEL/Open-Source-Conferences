Publication date: 2017-10-18
Playlist: 2017 Videos
Description: 
	I recorded my presentation at Ohio Linuxfest 2017.

Plain Text Accounting is the practice of maintaining a ledger in a format that values human readability, accountant auditability, and version control. The ledger-like ecosystem enables recording of purchases and transfers and investments, versioning of ledger-files to provide an audit trail, and performing analysis to produce registers, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, track billable time and paid time off, and lots of other reports. In this presentation, youâ€™ll learn some basic accounting principals, ledger tool usage, and why you might choose plain text accounting over Quicken, QuickBooks, Mint.com, or You Need a Budget.

all right hi this is an introduction to

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,849
plain text accounting using a basic

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,010
human readable plain text format and a

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,150
very top very powerful tool called

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,250
ledger in its entire ecosystem first a

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,380
couple housekeeping items

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,119
of course I have to give this obligatory

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,420
statement even though my talk isn't

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,830
really directly related my area of work

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,050
and I have to say it too

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,330
my words are my own and not that of my

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,520
employers past present or future nor

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,210
representative of any project of any

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,670
nature mentioned here in second please

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,360
hold all of your questions until the end

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,059
of the presentation lastly if you can't

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,980
read this bottom line you're gonna have

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,950
some difficulties reading some of the

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,320
text on the slides this is a very text

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:58,980
heavy presentation so please do feel

00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:02,070
free to to move up so every plain text

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,899
account yes I'm Colin Dean I'm director

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,970
of software engineering at a company

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,189
called Arcadia Healthcare Solutions and

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,750
I've been involved with the operation of

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,540
Pittsburgh's code and supply software

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,970
community since its inception I've

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,090
attended Ohio Linux fest yearly from

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,439
2007 to about 2014 this is my first year

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,890
back since and I'm really happy to be

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,520
here I was first introduced to this

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,729
system of accounting through time

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,470
tracking interestingly enough time

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,530
tracking is an alternative mode present

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,409
in the original ledger program I needed

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,689
a time tracking program to augment a

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,560
system at my consulting job that just

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,770
was fraught with bad UX but we really

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,259
needed really precise really precise

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,700
timing in information so we could bill

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,130
our clients like to the minute basically

00:01:52,700 --> 00:02:00,240
also as Bitcoin grew and grew in

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,640
popularity and I started trading not I

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,890
quickly adopted ledger for tracking my

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,329
own cryptocurrency activity kind of got

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,989
away from it whenever I stopped doing

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,270
active day trading with it last year I

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,490
started using ledger for tracking my own

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,350
paid time off

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,620
using a commodity which I'll get into

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,410
later I set up a system where my

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,730
workstation would email me a weekly

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:29,030
digest of my PTO so that it be inspired

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,500
to take more PTO unfortunately that

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,860
wasn't really enough because I barely

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,660
took any PTO in 2016 it was really nice

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,340
though to have that email and have that

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,430
kind of reminder of where I wasn't

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,580
taking my vacation this year I did

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,140
commit to using plain text accounting

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,640
for my own finances instead of the

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,320
spreadsheet format that it came up with

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,070
about ten years ago and that had been

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,170
maintaining lackadaisically ever since I

00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,300
also just started using ledger for the

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,970
coding supply scholarship funds finances

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,330
a separate 501 C 3 nonprofit that I

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,070
helped run so that I could benefit from

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,470
the same technologies that I was

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,840
building from scratch there but could

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,630
also build from scratch to my own use

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,860
the same stuff so these are some of the

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,280
things that I'll be covering during the

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,260
presentation first why accounting we'll

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,240
go over a brief on double-entry

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,430
accounting for people who have no idea

00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,070
what accounting really is we'll talk

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,230
about why ledger specifically some of

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,960
the the ledger format and things that

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,490
makes it as a powerful platform and then

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:38,180
some tricks everybody else are tricks so

00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,580
first of course is the the rhetorical

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,040
question why do you accounting Kri

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:47,270
personal finances and such you want to

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,430
know what you have you ought to know how

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,280
much money you have your disposal at any

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,260
given time what you have is a

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,390
combination of the money you can access

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,270
easily such as what's in your wallet or

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,530
your bank accounts and what money others

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,390
owe you

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,120
for example short-term loans and

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,740
reimbursements plus what money you owe

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,770
others which is generally negative

00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,720
amount for example a credit card a

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,350
mortgage or a vehicle loan or student

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,810
loans tracking your income and expenses

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,270
allows you to know what you have across

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,790
all of your accounts to know what you

00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:26,840
had at some point in the past to know

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,370
what you are owed and what you owe and

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,419
most importantly to note you can spend

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,080
in any given time moreover if you run a

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,180
business

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,370
you're probably legally required to keep

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,900
records of some sort this is called

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,030
bookkeeping and if you make enough money

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,860
you probably are paying somebody to do

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,990
it for you and you probably should have

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,710
pay somebody to do it for you so you can

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,990
focus on your business unless you wind

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,000
up penniless when you think you have

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,790
more than you do how can you actually

00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,919
recognize this character does anybody

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:03,470
know his name I had to look it up his

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,910
name is actually rich uncle Pennybags we

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,700
all know him from Monopoly and other

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,419
Parker Brothers games but hey we're junk

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,220
opinion bags

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,790
he'll show up in this presentation a

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:17,150
good bit let's talk some terminology do

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:19,220
we have any accountants in the room yes

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,720
great please bear with me on terminology

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,570
I'm a student of many disciplines

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,760
accounting is just one of them I've been

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,210
keeping books now for my organization's

00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,080
for about 15 years but I do still trip

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,510
up sometimes with terminology so the

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,150
first thing is an account this can be

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,810
your wallet bank account your credit

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,270
card investments

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,950
things like that there are five common

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,680
categories of accounts first of all is

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,770
assets these and these include things

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,250
like your bank accounts your wallet your

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:01,220
investments and loans you've credited to

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,889
others your loans you've given to others

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,050
there's income this includes things like

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:11,180
your paychecks and your gifts received

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,470
and dividends and interest now go into

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,410
things that are generally up flows

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:22,479
expenses like groceries and taxes and

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,639
gifts that you've given and donations

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,310
last of these four major ones is

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,560
liabilities so these include things like

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,810
your mortgage your credit cards your

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,210
student loans and any loans that you've

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:40,639
owed to others let me take a picture and

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,340
then for everything else there's

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,900
equity equity is commonly used as a

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,180
catch-all

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,069
I use it as catch-all is most often used

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,689
to capture things like opening balances

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:55,580
but also serves as a bin for rewards

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:58,279
cash back things like that as well as

00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,210
unbalanced Abul accounts such as when

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,249
you're just kind of throwing your arms

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,110
up in the air when you're balancing your

00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,969
checkbook because you have no idea where

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,800
that one penny is and you rather go

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:11,810
drink a beer credits are things added to

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,009
an account while debits are things

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:20,389
removed from an account associating

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:23,090
credits and debits with accounts begets

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,469
a transaction commonly with some kind of

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,810
a timestamp indicating when the

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,050
transaction occurred or when it was

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,389
posted finalized and some kind of

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,289
description of the transaction one

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,400
transaction contains credits which

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,990
increase the value of an account and

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,830
debits which decrease the value of

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,069
aitikaf most transactions debit one

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,659
account and credit the other but they

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,400
can't include they can't include

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,529
multiple credits and multiple debits if

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,639
you've got multiple ins and outs for a

00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:58,759
single single transaction all

00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,259
transactions must balance this means

00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,099
that the sum of the debits and the

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,529
credits must be equal to zero if you

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,830
take $100 from one collection of

00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,210
accounts you must add $100 to another

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,990
collection of accounts in order for the

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:16,310
transaction to be valid and balanced the

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,830
number of debits and credits need not be

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,279
equal either if a bunch of people say

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,139
roommates were to give you money that

00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,610
you are owed all at once you might

00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,800
record it as just one transaction

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,810
whenever you take it to the bank you can

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,979
see that an example there where three

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,300
people have given you money and you've

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:35,870
put some in the bank and then kept some

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,430
cash for yourself no double entry

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,829
accounting program will allow an

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,870
unbalanced transaction double entry

00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:45,440
accounting itself does not allow

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,750
unbalanced transactions let's talk about

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,370
some programs

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,370
first of all QuickBooks

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,440
QuickBooks is probably the most widely

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,269
used accounting program it's got

00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,649
basically everything you need for

00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:01,390
running a business built right into it

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,420
it's also pretty expensive its

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,310
proprietary but it runs everywhere it

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,399
runs with desktops smartphones the web

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,950
whatever

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,870
mint another Intuit product automates

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,029
the collections the collection of

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,940
transactions but relies a lot on manual

00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:21,760
curation of the pays and the data that

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,470
comes in it's really great to get

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,570
warnings and get some really quick

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,610
graphs if you're just wanting a really

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:31,300
high level of you I've used it since

00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:34,630
about 2009 mostly for those but I

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,300
stopped trying to fix everything in 2013

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,810
because it just wasn't worth my time I'm

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,640
spending far more much time trying to

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,500
match transfers from accounts it just

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,760
didn't work that great for me I do still

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,089
use it for large transaction

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,070
notifications although now almost every

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,160
credit card company and bank that I have

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,949
has their own large transaction

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,690
notifications that get to me faster than

00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,140
mints those mints usually a day or two

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,839
behind you need a budget commonly

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,579
referred to as blind app is another tool

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,670
aimed at the personal finance market

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,459
it's focusing on it focuses on budgeting

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,380
not on necessarily bookkeeping it's

00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,570
pretty batteries included with a focus

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,300
on building good budgeting habits rather

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,579
than just tracking transactions my nav

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,430
is a is now subscription-based it used

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:27,420
to be a purchase to software it's now

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,279
subscription-based web and mobile app

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,490
it's a pretty good option for people who

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,589
are just trying to learn budgeting I

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,240
would be remiss to omit open source

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:41,550
tools such as K my money and new cash

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,660
these are both of course free and

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,430
there's a mobile version of new cash

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,160
just that I just found out about a

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,529
couple months ago the new cash was

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,050
actually my introduction to double-entry

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:56,560
accounting but I gave up on it when I

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,000
read opted my costs in about 2009 and I

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,860
went back to spreadsheets because this

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,300
is what I was comfortable from I only

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,560
really been using a new cash for about

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:08,410
six months at that point then

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,209
finally there's Letcher the whole reason

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,910
why we're here

00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:14,820
Ledger's itself command-line only but

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,519
the ecosystem that is developed around

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,360
this one tool and the derivatives that

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,339
it has inspired can allow a variety of

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,410
modalities variety of devices you can

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:30,070
use it on however the core goal will

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:33,370
always be of a bludger itself to be a

00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:37,810
solid command-line experience and of

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:40,079
course you'll always be free this is a

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,959
screenshot of the wikipedia page

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,120
documenting accounting tools there's a

00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,010
lot of other open source software out

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,720
there that can do this this it this is

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,480
all this is the list of all of the open

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,430
source tools most of these tools are

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,519
oriented towards running a business on

00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,370
open source ledger follows the UNIX

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,180
philosophy it does one thing and it does

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,589
it well well technically two things

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,019
because it does have a time tracking

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:13,470
mode but really the time tracking mode

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:17,680
is simply a currency in its unit system

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:20,829
so why do we want to use ledger why why

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,740
should you use ledger by entering each

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:27,519
transaction manually you can spend that

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,610
money again and more than just at the

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,070
time you hand over your cash or your

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,949
insert your chip card incorrectly the

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:40,029
first time or you click complete order

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:43,180
or buy it now if you really really hate

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,980
the manual entry of data for what

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,829
meaning is about five minutes per night

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,199
on a normal day lots of folks have

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:52,990
automated extraction and transformation

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,890
from bank and quicken formats I don't I

00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,339
really don't like it though everything

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:03,579
in ledger is just a commodity a number

00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,639
gives the commodity and account them are

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:10,810
an amount rather accounts can contain

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,940
multiple commodities this means you can

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,730
use ledger to track inventory for your

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,199
business I wouldn't recommend it it's

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,100
not necessarily meant for that but you

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:20,589
can do it

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,810
mmm-hmm if you could do it with any size

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,209
business to from you know like a banana

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:31,029
stand or something to multinational

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:33,130
corporation letter is just text and a

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:37,600
program that reads that text to produce

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:39,670
reports it's fast incredibly fast it

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,380
uses very very little memory and it

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,720
doesn't stay loaded in RAM it's not like

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,240
a desktop application that's there and

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,060
occupying 500 megabytes of RAM because

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,649
it's an electron that the records are

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,209
about as raw as they can get

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,339
so if you're an account if your

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:58,720
accountant or your IRS agents need them

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,670
you can just give them a text file and

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,470
say here's everything go do whatever

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:08,529
with it you don't have a need to go dig

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,990
up book cooker 1997 or some other

00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:13,420
obscure program you bought for $10 20

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,550
years ago and you still run it in a VM

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,430
because you know this is where all of

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:21,779
your records have been one of the

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,069
dangers of proprietary software he goes

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,709
the text format has some very simple

00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,930
rules so it's very easy to parse very

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:31,810
easy to write a parser from scratch for

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,470
it and more importantly really easy to

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:38,470
construct I've built a few scripts that

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,779
construct ledger records based on other

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,120
outputs that's just what one of those

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,790
translators I talked about is being

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,649
simply human readable text the format

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,350
really lends itself to versioning as

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,170
well so you can use git or Bazaar or

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:57,009
something to store track collaborate and

00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:00,100
audit your transaction just like they

00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,680
were code this ecosystem really lends

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,339
itself towards automation so you can use

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,490
common tools like make to automate your

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,899
build process only your build process

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,189
building a program is building like a

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:18,670
financial report let's talk about ledger

00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:23,920
format so a transaction and ledger has

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:26,019
these parts there's a timestamp a payee

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,329
a series of accounts with debits and

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,490
credits and optionally some comments

00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,110
comments can be on a transaction or they

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,740
can be on individual

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:38,980
lines in the statement here's an example

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,310
of a simple transaction so let's walk

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:46,029
through this here's the date it's always

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:49,959
in ISO 8601 format year followed by

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:52,000
month and date no weirdness between US

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,930
and European floor mats for us and

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,660
everybody else ledger and some others

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,050
allow slashes instead of dashes

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,690
I prefer dashes this isn't a payee

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,279
I like commonplace coffee they're a copy

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,870
coffee shop in Squirrel Hill in

00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,819
Pittsburgh they've got the best cold

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,930
brew in Pittsburgh I make lots of cold

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:13,769
beer references throughout this because

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:17,019
I was in a coffee shop and was making it

00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:18,730
the payee can also be a note about the

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,000
transaction doesn't necessarily have to

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:25,269
be an entity something like transfer for

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,550
down payment something like that this is

00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:29,610
the account label sub accounts and

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,899
ledger format are separated with colons

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,089
that way ledger can build a tree

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:36,939
structure to show you where your money

00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:39,339
is at a high level for example you could

00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:42,009
see something that is at expenses or

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,199
something that is it restaurants within

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,529
expenses and see all of your restaurants

00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,720
expenditure here I've created a

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:52,509
sub-account to track my coffee spending

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,769
I could also just do expenses

00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:55,959
restaurants as was where I put my

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:57,579
restaurant spending even for lunch I

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,880
could do a separate one that's like

00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:03,040
expenses restaurants lunch if I want to

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,319
this explicitly track how much time I'm

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,850
there how much money I'm spending just

00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:12,159
buying lunch instead of bringing lunch

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,780
this here is the amount it's a credit

00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:17,289
because it's a positive number

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,059
note that expenses are credited this is

00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,890
because accounts must be deducted when

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,260
you're spending money I'm taking money

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:28,179
out of my wallet and giving it to

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,309
somebody else this is another account

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,919
it's advised to separate your assets

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,990
into a few different categories cash

00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,760
contains your wallet your bank accounts

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,000
and anything else that is liquid and

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,940
accessible investments contains money

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,370
that is not liquid or illiquid your

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,860
retirement accounts your stock brokerage

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,450
counts maybe some stock you got when you

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,130
gave your friends some money because he

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,950
wanted to create the Facebook killer or

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,040
something reimbursements contained

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,809
amounts that are owed to you such as

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,220
when you book thousands of dollars of

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,670
company travel and your credit card to

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,220
get the rewards points lastly here's my

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,400
debit for the transaction it's negative

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:14,080
to debit Ledger's pretty smart and lets

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,720
the user emit one accounts amount this

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,179
signifies the ledger that any imbalance

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
in the transaction should be assigned to

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:22,660
the account that doesn't have an

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,240
explicit amount ledger would see the

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,620
students this transaction know that some

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,670
account needs to be debited three

00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,320
dollars in order to balance the

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,320
transaction but then assign the

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,690
remainder to that one account with that

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,510
has no amount specified this is really

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,610
great for crew for creating very complex

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,890
transactions where a large part the

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,179
expenditure goes into one category that

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,630
you don't want to take the time to break

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:49,059
down so let's change it up a little bit

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:52,450
the next day our hero gets another

00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:58,360
coffee and this time she pays with a

00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:03,400
credit card instead of cash and puts in

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,110
a comment saying Kolber the credit cards

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,740
are a liability because it's money that

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:11,100
you owe someone else you're credited the

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,280
expense and you've deducted the

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,550
liability

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,559
I advise creating a sub-account for

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,510
credit cards with like the name of the

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,040
card just so that you're ready for when

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:30,660
you get another card even if you only

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:33,010
have one a few days later it's payday

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,570
income goes into a well named account

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,470
and the credit goes into her bank

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,350
account

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,420
why is income debited think about it for

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,870
a second it's your employer's bank

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:49,540
account so their bank account must

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:51,040
decrease as much as yours increases the

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,010
next payday she wants to move some money

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,990
from checking into savings very easy to

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:59,290
express the payee can be your own name

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,030
or just simply describe the transfer

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,270
the next paycheck though our hero wants

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:07,419
to kick up her tracking just a notch she

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,309
wants to track the taxes paid to keep

00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:11,590
things uniform and save herself from

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:14,500
figuring out the amounts just right she

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,720
probably goes back and edits the a past

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,400
transactions to look like this you're

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,380
using a versioning control system you

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,290
can see how things changed over time you

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,600
can go back change things and know hey I

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:30,280
did it this way a long time ago now let

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,530
me understand the format let's see how

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,429
ledger is executed and how it reports

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,270
important information to the user here's

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,070
the first example

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,320
take a take a look kind of digest what's

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:50,679
up here see how it comports with what

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:52,419
you just learned so there's a

00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,020
transaction establishing some opening

00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:59,320
balances there's a single expense coffee

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,330
run of course there's pay day and then

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,880
there's a transfer to stables things we

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,580
just talked about if we invoke ledger

00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,919
with a simple balance command we can see

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:15,309
the value of every count with the nested

00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:17,559
accounts broken out we can also see a

00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,540
list of all of the accounts that we have

00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,490
in the system this is pretty useful for

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,250
checking for typos if you're not using

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,960
strict mode or strict mode where you

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,280
have to define all of the accounts

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,960
before you actually start using them

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,559
this also lets you be able to catch

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,970
things like missed missed pluralization

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,260
x' maybe instead of when you typed out

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,710
expenses restaurants coffee you typed

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,830
expenses restaurant coffee this is

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,510
useful for that payees is a similar

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,610
command and it'll show you all the

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,210
payees in the record again it's mostly

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,370
for typos register this is probably the

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,140
smallest text in this in this in the

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,650
presentation so you can see this you're

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,480
good register outputs by default a list

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,370
of every transaction with its credits

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,100
and debits plus a running balance for

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,559
each account there's some other accounts

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,260
there's some other commands too but

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,169
these four especially balance and

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,950
register

00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:17,480
probably the most commonly used commands

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,399
this is another example of a balanced

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,419
command that where in taxes have been

00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:25,090
tracked as a part of that those

00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,679
transaction records I showed you earlier

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,590
some ledger likes make this view a

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,590
little bit easier putting in like tree

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,179
viewing characters I really like those

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,679
and I'm gonna be actually trying to add

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:41,509
those to ledger in the next couple of

00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:46,999
months balance and register alone aren't

00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:48,950
really that useful it's really those are

00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:51,440
kind of the basic commands they give you

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,200
a view of everything what you really are

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,609
interested in as you are especially

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,309
running a business or you're trying to

00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:02,419
understand your net worth are these

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:05,450
things if you deduct income from

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:07,669
expenses you get your cash flow positive

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,409
cash flow and ledger means that more

00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,909
money is going out than coming in a

00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:16,489
negative cash flow means that you're

00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:19,609
saving money if surplus having positive

00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:21,529
cash flow isn't necessarily bad because

00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:22,700
you might have had emergency expenses or

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,659
have been saving up for really big

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,470
purchase our example transactions show a

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:33,399
surplus because the total is negative

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:36,259
ledger uses simple reg X like syntax for

00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:40,460
selecting certain accounts you can see

00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:42,889
the the red X like up there deduct

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,129
liabilities from assets and you've that

00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:49,249
you've derived your net worth is it bad

00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:51,080
for this number to be negative no if

00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:52,730
your net worth is negative that's not

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,409
necessarily a bad thing it just means

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,450
that you owe more than what you

00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,440
currently have

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,080
maybe you're paying on your student

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:06,859
loans mortgage children student loans

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:10,159
whatever you're not alone 50% of

00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:15,019
Americans in 2015 or 2014 had zero net

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:19,940
worth so here's what a net worth balance

00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:23,989
looks like this person has a good bit of

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:25,680
money next let's talk about commodity

00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:28,560
management

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,630
here are some examples of what a

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:36,810
commodity specific transaction can look

00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:39,450
like note the explicit use of USD here I

00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,190
recommend using USD instead of a dollar

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,470
sign ledger does allow you to put a

00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,440
dollar sign at the beginning rather than

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:50,100
using after syntax it's better to use

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,600
this syntax because it works better with

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,040
although all of the tools with the

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,690
ecosystem not every tool supports a

00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:02,880
currency symbol generally could prefer

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:09,450
commodity words the novel expression in

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:12,000
this amount vti is because when you'd be

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,650
that's being used as commodity these

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,080
transactions say debit the checking

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,080
account this amount and credit the Roth

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,630
IRA account this much at this commodity

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,200
for this much of this commodity at this

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:27,800
price the top transaction says how much

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,210
to debit while the lower transaction

00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:35,640
lets ledger figure that out we can build

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,800
a price database with up to the second

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,480
resolution for tracking long term

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,960
securities it's best to just use the

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,790
market closed at a single date note that

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,040
these are not real crisis for vti

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,600
I started that but then the swings

00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,440
simply weren't enough to be able to show

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,880
next couple slides we use a slightly

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,420
different command to run our balanced

00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:01,110
report now we provide the price database

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,970
file and then use the V command to

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,880
instruct ledger to resolve the current

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:08,400
value of the commodities in the price

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,780
database we also use the end command to

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,450
say when I want the report to end

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,900
instead of running it for all data it

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:19,220
easier way to displaying these slides

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,990
when I run it again a few days later or

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:26,460
a few days later end date you can see

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:29,850
that the value changed that zero sum is

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:33,570
gone because we have a game a few days

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:38,330
later we have another game ooh you got a

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:40,280
pop Oh starting to go down

00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:44,090
you're not broke it's just America down

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,260
a ledger is a very powerful accounting

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,060
tool and there's some advanced feature

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,180
that I can't cover in our time together

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:54,290
these are some of them

00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:57,170
I particularly of all of these have used

00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,550
balanced assertions the most balanced

00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,430
assertions are a great way to make sure

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,880
that what your bank account is showing

00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:07,400
is what your ledger says that you have

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,110
and it will tell you hey this doesn't

00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,640
add up and you can figure out what

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,250
things are missing that's when you get

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,580
into that equity equity unknown we'll

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,140
just kind of throw in your arms up there

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,670
are three other features that I want to

00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,940
highlight for you in about the last

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,010
twenty minutes we have you can do

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,220
budgeting by declaring periodic

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:30,890
transactions that is transactions that

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,060
execute daily weekly monthly yearly and

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,690
are checked against your real

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,580
transactions given this budget stanza at

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,020
the beginning of a ledger file it always

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,420
has to be at the beginning before any

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,010
other transactions we can see how much

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,460
money we have left in our bet in our

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,740
budget

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,750
notice that the assets of the assets

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,790
amount at the bottom doesn't have an

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,290
amount associated with it that's because

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,920
we want ledger to figure out how much

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:58,510
assets we need in order to satisfy our

00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:02,930
budget here's some example transactions

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:05,330
for paying against that budget here's

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,640
what remains in our budget the important

00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,380
things are highlighted in red notice

00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,570
first that ledger figured out what our

00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:14,060
assets needs to increase bimonthly in

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,710
order to afford our budget about four

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,650
thousand five hundred and sixty seven

00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:23,870
dollars it's a rather round number

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,850
notice then that the transactions didn't

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,520
touch gasoline so it's still at full

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:31,100
budget we used a little bit of our

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,660
thirty dollar coffee budget and lastly

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,090
we only paid five hundred eighty over

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,850
six hundred dollar mortgage budget okay

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,340
sometimes pay extra sometimes you don't

00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,660
every little bit counts

00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,610
forecasting will apply periodic

00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,070
transactions representing budgeting

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,450
until some condition is reached such as

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:51,950
your checking account balance being zero

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:54,019
I find Ledger's forecasting feature

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,179
to use difficult to read and have it

00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:58,880
really used it maybe if I build an

00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,860
advanced plain text accounting talk I'll

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,549
dig more into it and really rock it so I

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,549
can teach it better

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:09,679
lastly timekeeping this is my first

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,710
introduction to ledger and probably the

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,740
feature that I use daily the most I kept

00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,809
my time in this format for about two

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,960
years and was recently asked to resume

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:23,630
this procedure at my new job where we're

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,330
now tracking time again here's an

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,690
example of the timekeeping syntax really

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:32,450
really simple what this does under the

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:35,120
hood it creates a special commodity just

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:39,830
for time ledger allows you to specify

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:44,360
units within units so think of like you

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:46,820
can you could express express cents as a

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,100
hundred cents equals one dollar and then

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,510
denote your commodity to be cents

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,710
instead of dollars or think of like

00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:57,980
Dungeons & Dragons or something where

00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:02,570
there was copper copper silver gold and

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:05,929
they were all kind of ten silver was one

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:08,899
gold that kind of thing in that same way

00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,669
we can express like okay here's hours

00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:13,730
there are 60 minutes in an hour there's

00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:16,399
60 seconds in a minute there's 24 hours

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,019
in a day those kinds of things and be

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,260
able to have the flexibility to show all

00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:26,350
of these units within a single a single

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,669
account here's the balance for that file

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,260
here's the balance for a format very

00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:33,169
similar to what I use my consoling days

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,669
and what I and very similar to what I'm

00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:39,169
starting to use now interestingly enough

00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:41,870
away is a really good way of tracking

00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:45,919
your PTO if you don't want to track your

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:47,950
PTO explicitly it's always good to

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,070
separate billable and non-billable tasks

00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:54,169
as well ledger technically supports

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,899
these as comments and they will show up

00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,730
as different different accounts just

00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:01,330
makes it easier to read it's all part of

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:05,630
the same account name the ledger doesn't

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,770
get persnickety about a

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:11,179
name's whenever you put things in

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:13,910
brackets and then here's a register

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:17,090
command on time there's also a special

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:19,250
time report mode that you can put on the

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,460
balance command I find it difficult to

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,750
read I don't really use it a whole lot

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,850
if you really want to get into time

00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:29,510
tracking with ledger please check out my

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:32,510
github profile just colin dean where my

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,760
high mo project hej mo contains my time

00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,860
tracking setup complete with a script

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,980
that automates a lot of the generation

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,760
of the time using new dates relative

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:46,400
timing features there are a few other

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,580
features to which i consider to be

00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,240
pretty advanced in usage i don't really

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:55,070
use them that much

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,950
because of it if you want to try out

00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:01,010
ledger you can get it at lender CLI door

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,620
ledger - CLI org and there's the docs

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,080
link down there as well it's available

00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,940
at every package manager in every op and

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,860
like every operating system i think you

00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:14,000
can even get it on like anywhere and you

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:17,110
can do it on your router who knew you

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,960
could track your finances on a router

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,130
there's more though because we've talked

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,630
about ledger we've talked about its

00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:30,169
competitors we haven't talked yet about

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:32,929
its ecosystem we call this the plaintext

00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:36,289
accounting ecosystem hash tag plaintext

00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:41,090
accounting this site is the communities

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:44,919
hub here's a quick screenshot of text

00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:48,289
it's pretty plain plaintext accounting

00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:51,350
bad joke the site curates

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,360
recommendations for tools for importing

00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,770
transactions from banks or tools for

00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,530
manual entry syntax highlighting user

00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,390
interfaces and more it also lists some

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:03,650
of the discussion groups that started

00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:09,549
around it

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,960
I run the reddit one it's small

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:14,059
it also has generalized guides for how

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,340
to work with most of the ledger likes

00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,690
and the ecosystems so you can learn

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,900
learn some of the common tasks you can

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:25,890
get into reconciliation learn budgeting

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:30,690
in them as well as multiple currencies

00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:33,000
and everybody's favorite taxes nonprofit

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,710
accounting is really interesting one of

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,450
the things that I'm working on

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,850
interestingly enough the software

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,040
freedom Conservancy is that one of the

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,890
primary producers of information on how

00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,060
to do nonprofit accounting with ledger

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,800
they're they're really pioneering

00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,610
pioneering in that field and I'm

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,440
starting to use some of their

00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,640
methodologies and how I'm doing couldn't

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,640
supply scholarship fund stuff

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,750
many have existed throughout times but

00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,210
these are the ones that are in active

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,830
development there's been more than a

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,410
hundred ledger likes throughout history

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,820
these are the ones that are active the

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,220
ledger at the top is the one that I've

00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,050
been talking about today and is what I

00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,550
use for my time tracking at work and

00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,700
what I use for coding supply of

00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:16,680
scholarship funds bookkeeping I myself

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,590
tend to use abandon because it's written

00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,630
in scala my preferred language so I feel

00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,240
a little bit more comfortable reading

00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:26,850
its code whenever I encounter problems I

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,020
prefer to report formatting but one of

00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,610
the things is having me probably

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,350
switching off of it sometime soon unless

00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,120
they actually get around to doing it is

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,530
implementing commodity support they

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,310
wanna be able to track my stocks so in a

00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,700
mill check my bitcoins bean count is

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,870
also worth noting it's very popular

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,270
unfortunately its format diverges

00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:47,010
significantly from ledger format it's

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,230
the each transaction still looks the

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,780
same but there are other things that go

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,450
into it that are required such as you

00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:56,610
must declare all of your accounts you

00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,700
have to use certain syntax for certain

00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:03,510
things where Ledger's not as militant

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,420
about syntax in some areas bean count

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,890
also has the best you I support the

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,480
Python community is really kind of

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:15,660
rallied around it to build something

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,200
like this this is a tree map of my 2017

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,790
expenses as of mid-july rendered by

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,200
follow fava is a web UI for being count

00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,300
I've been using it for a few months now

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,490
and I really like the visualizations

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,500
that it gives me these tree maps are

00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:36,010
great abandon itself

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,800
output ledger format reports without all

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:43,050
of it without like doing weird things to

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,670
its aliases however it can output XML

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,160
and it's basically xml xml

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,310
representation of how abandonned thinks

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,420
it's processing ledger so because it's

00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:57,100
just xml i wrote some XSL

00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,890
transformations that transform the

00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:02,620
abandoned XML into bean count ledger

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:06,820
format through a few steps it works

00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:09,720
really well make fava and suddenly I've

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:12,520
got a web browser open that has this

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,190
this is the exact same data expressed as

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,710
a sunburst graph pull out easier to see

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:21,730
like oh hey I'm spending a lot of money

00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:28,870
on pets that's somewhere over here this

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:32,470
over here huge thing that's taxes so

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:35,440
here's some takeaways accounting informs

00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:37,480
us of how much we have bookkeeping is

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,580
the practice of tracking these

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:44,020
transactions double-entry accounting

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:47,050
requires balanced transactions there are

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,000
many tools some are paid some are free

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,880
each have different strengths and

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,830
weaknesses ledger is probably the most

00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,410
well known plaintext accounting tool

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:57,190
there's a whole system and community

00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,910
around it

00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,350
IRC reddit getter anything you can think

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,920
of there's a community talking about

00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:08,290
letter text lends itself to easier

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,390
management especially for we technology

00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,720
types who like using version control

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,510
systems manual entry may seem tedious

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,630
but it enables really intimate knowledge

00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,770
of your finances if yours but if you

00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,560
feel like they're spending too much

00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:26,140
money you should do this whether or not

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,840
you're using ledger or YNAB or another

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,910
tool this will help you spend less money

00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,570
because you will be much more aware of

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:37,030
the money that you're spending

00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,080
lastly ledger enables you to use the

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,380
command line tools you're already

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:45,610
familiar with I grep my logs

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:48,350
frequently I can cut them I can

00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:49,850
reformat them with awk do anything on

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,370
what with the tools that I am already

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:58,780
familiar using with that I use just to

00:37:52,370 --> 00:38:01,910
quote his ledger the best I don't know

00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:06,280
it works great for me and the

00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:09,020
organizations whose finances I I manage

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,440

00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,850

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:20,630
try some proprietary ones try some free

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:22,340
ones I've always come back to ledger and

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:29,060

00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:06,410

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,700
Twitter account to follow pretty much

retweet this is the primary IRC chat the

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:27,530
gentlemen who is they the original

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,690
author of ledger hangs out there as well

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,210
as the authors of all the ledger likes

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,440

00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,660
question about anything and get

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,450
information about how to do it in any

00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:42,680
ledger like lastly if you want to see

00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:45,110
these slides there's a link down there I

00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,040
still have a little bit of time I'm a

00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:53,230
little bit ahead so I guess I can take

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,230
some questions yes sir

00:39:53,470 --> 00:40:33,460
environment so you end with saying yes

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:38,700
the tool type references are going to

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:42,970
change so wildly between auditors and

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:46,210
accountants if you are if you get to a

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:48,640
level that you're required to audit to

00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,190
be alert to have your finances audited

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,170
you might be getting to the point that

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,040
you're better off hiring an accountant

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:58,930
to track all of this so you might close

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,510
the books on one year and say okay the

00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,480
next year we're gonna pay an accountant

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,010
to do this it's now their their problem

00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,140
you might have your entire setup and be

00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,430
able to teach them how to use this tool

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,830
so that you're still able to interact

00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:14,140
with your finances there's also some

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:23,470
converters that folks have written that

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:26,010
will handle how to export to quicken or

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:28,600
QuickBooks or do it as a spreadsheet

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,870
almost everything comes down to export

00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,790
as a spreadsheet and let let somebody

00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,060
who's a pro with quick and import it

00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,060
that way

00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:49,960
import sands for most of this input

00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,850
sands it's a code editing font that I've

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,850
started to use just about everywhere and

00:41:51,850 --> 00:42:00,400

00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:05,110

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,220
