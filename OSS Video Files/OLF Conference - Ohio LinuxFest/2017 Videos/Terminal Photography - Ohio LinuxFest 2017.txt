Title: Terminal Photography - Ohio LinuxFest 2017

Description: 
	A survey of command-line tools and libraries for working with photography from a command-line interface. This presentation was given at Ohio LinuxFest 2017.
The slides, which are mostly illegible in this video, can be found at https://goo.gl/9fw1Lh

I created the slides for a 1024x768 projector on LibreOffice Impress 5 on an older laptop running Ubuntu Mate, and scaled a lot of the source images to speed up performance during the presentation.
After the presentation, I imported them into Google Slides, and had to re-format a lot of it. They are otherwise fairly faithful to the originals.
