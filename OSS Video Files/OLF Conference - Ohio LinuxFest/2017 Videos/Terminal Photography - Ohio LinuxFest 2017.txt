Title: Terminal Photography - Ohio LinuxFest 2017
Publication date: 2017-10-07
Playlist: 2017 Videos
Description: 
	A survey of command-line tools and libraries for working with photography from a command-line interface. This presentation was given at Ohio LinuxFest 2017.
The slides, which are mostly illegible in this video, can be found at https://goo.gl/9fw1Lh

I created the slides for a 1024x768 projector on LibreOffice Impress 5 on an older laptop running Ubuntu Mate, and scaled a lot of the source images to speed up performance during the presentation.
After the presentation, I imported them into Google Slides, and had to re-format a lot of it. They are otherwise fairly faithful to the originals.

all right I'm gonna get started so that

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,250
we can sort of keep it on schedule

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,620
I mentioned earlier I'm gonna repeat it

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,360
and you notice anyone the back half of

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,990
the room might have some issues with

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,939
legibility unfortunately I was limited

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,560
to 1024 by 768 so the full impact of

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,990
photography can't really be felt

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,599
also photography on a projector kind of

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,890
sucks anyways so I apologize for some of

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,029
the limitations that we're gonna be

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,440
dealing with here

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:36,660
I am Simone Ruiz and the title of my

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,149
presentation is terminal photography I'm

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,079
going to be talking about doing all

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:48,090
kinds of working with images capturing

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,100
them modifying them etc without using a

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,399
graphical user interface that's going to

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:59,789
cover both command-line tools and a

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:02,160
little bit of scripting so why do I love

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,670
this stuff I'm about you

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,610
so I began using computers on the

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,520
command line one of my first memories it

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,950
was my father setting up an Epson qx10

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,189
green screen computer in my room when he

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:22,920
got the new IBM PC this was running an

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:25,880
old operating system called CPM and from

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,310
there I actually used this PC where I

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,750
learned CPM and Doster pretty much the

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,850
same as far as the basic command

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,759
structures and then moving on when

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,110
Windows decided to get all graphical

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,689
bringing up the terminal and Windows was

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,659
the command prompt very similar than

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,750
what they went 32-bit spelled CMD but my

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:51,210
favorite command line these days is bash

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:52,799
I started with bash when I connected

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,450
into a UNIX system for the first time

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,060
over the Internet and it felt so weird

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,880
at first but at this point it is my

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,869
native language and I feel most

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,060
comfortable in it

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,820
I am a Linux user and the system

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:13,650
Minister so I began getting paid more or

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:18,130
less to work in Linux back in I say 2005

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,980
basically I started gone

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,420
my job wasn't to do it but I was working

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,670
for a public school at the time that got

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,790
a grant to put out a bunch of computers

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,970
and our IT department refused to support

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:34,060
clinics so we were on our own

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,610
I googled some stuff I connected to the

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,830
local Linux user group and not too long

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,120
after that one of them said hey there's

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,459
this oh hi all the next best thing you

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,680
need to come to he wouldn't take no for

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,530
an answer so I can't add that been

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,780
coming since then at all might use a

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,660
Bluetooth I've been using Ubuntu since

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,060
the beginning was my beginning for a

00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,940
long time I was involved with the local

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:03,280
community in Indiana lately I used to

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,170
use a thumb - at work as well these days

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,390
I'm in the corporate world and we're

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,640
using sent us so scripting and

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,579
programming is kind of near and dear to

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,500
me because sort of that's where I feel

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,560
like you get all the power of a computer

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,120
like it's great what a computer lets you

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,530
do visually if you've ever wanted to do

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,510
something where you didn't already know

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,430
how to do it I really love sort of the

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,870
discoverability of a graphical user

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,880
interface where you can just kind of

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,030
click the buttons and see what happens

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,850
but after you actually understand what's

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,859
going on and you want to sort of take it

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:46,109
to the next level it really helps drop

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:48,310
into a more call-and-response

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,519
command-line way of doing things and

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,739
then once you understand that level of

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,799
things you can put them into a text file

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,630
and then just say do that instead of

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,910
having to describe it every time and

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,880
unless you do things you know several

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,130
hundreds of thousands

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,120
times been really quickly which I like

00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,770
so back again my native language one of

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,810
the nicest things about it if you've

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,960
ever had to do batch scripting in the

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,690
windows world is that bash is a fully

00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,610
functional programming language for the

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,290
things that it's frustrating for I tend

00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,410
to move to Python and recently I've been

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:29,030
learning Ruby which are both excellent

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:31,010
programming languages I do do more

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,860
lower-level stuff from time to time but

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,230
I'm not gonna get into that here I have

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,030
been into photography since I got the

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:44,510
little appointment ship point shoot

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:47,450
little 1:10 tiny little camera in first

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,760
grade and back then I would I would hit

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,140
the button and then I would have to wait

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,150
a long time before ever saw what came

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,410
out of it so I'm super excited about the

00:04:53,150 --> 00:05:00,650
digital photography revolution just

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,980
about 10 years ago suddenly we went from

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,470
digital photography being kind of like

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,020
meat to it actually being professionally

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,110
viable my camera which I'm using the

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,450
record this takes very high resolution

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,710
though and if I were to print them out I

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,510
could probably print them out on a

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,140
poster size and they still look pretty

00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,240
good

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,890
compared to my first digital camera

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,410
which was pixelated on an

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,350
eight-and-a-half by 11 sheet of paper so

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,490
I'm super excited about that and most

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,070
people who are really into photography

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:34,460
ask what brand ears

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,350
can you tend to choose one and stick

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,570
with it because they don't interoperate

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,540
very well and you've already made an

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,000
investment you know in a DSLR camera can

00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,480
be

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,740
expensive so you're probably not gonna

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,020
once you have a collection of

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,850
accessories switch to the competitor

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,610
they definitely have the lock down in

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,830
that hyperspace

00:05:52,610 --> 00:06:00,960
so the first tools I'm going to talk

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:04,890
about I feel not as interesting until

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,850
you have a problem right so how many

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:11,190
times have you had something like a

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,610
storage device like an SD card or a hard

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,530
drive crash if you're like me my main

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,060
concern is my images

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:23,669
I would probably freak out if I lost all

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,660
of my photography so I got really good

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,610
at taking dead media and reading through

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,550
it to try to figure out how like what I

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,110
can get out of it and these are the free

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,550
basic tools I always start with so I'm

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,890
going to just mention them

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,350
give me a DD rescue now there are two

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,510
different DD rescues the canoe DD rescue

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,300
is the one that I'm most familiar with

00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,760
and the one that I appreciate I will be

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,400
throwing up apt-get command lines to

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,590
show you what packages are and that's

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,720
where you go to and Debian centric but

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,600
most of the stuff will be available

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,240
across your platform so in the blue

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,350
world that's a GED rescue the first

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,680
command line here says I want you to

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,660
take whatever is on dev SDF which is

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,510
probably an SD card that's no longer

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,090
reading right I want you to write it up

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,880
to this file backup DD which is going to

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,520
be a bit for bit copy of it it needs to

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,280
have a log because it keeps track of

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,740
what's exhausting Wilson and then the -

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,630
r3 says how much the read time to retry

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,010
three times so the first time it just

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,990
starts at the beginning and goes through

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,729
and says can I read it

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,669
yeah can I read it yeah can I read it

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,979
can I read it no move on the second time

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:40,229
it will only go back and retry the ones

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,700
that failed the first time and then up

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,520
through you know a third time for good

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,400
measure in case

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,849
twice and then agrees after three times

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,280
if it's not reading you can depending on

00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:54,340
how much you care about it keep trying

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,229
I've definitely kept trying lot beyond

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,180
the point of reasonable disc and still

00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,590
gotten results so it depends on how much

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,210
time you want to invest on it you might

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,849
still be able to get that stuff just by

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,139
trying and trying try the nice thing is

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,090
you're not the one trying and trying and

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:09,250
trying you can just set that to - bar

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,620
negative one walk away for a day and

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,620
come back and you'll your computer will

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,960
give you exactly what it could find test

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,259
this super important especially if on

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,930
the command line you screw up a

00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:25,870
partitioning command and if you mess up

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,840
the partition table your operating

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,669
system won't be able to find anything

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,450
but it's still there

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:37,029
okay so test this is a really great

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,060
package that just reads what's actually

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:42,669
on the hard drive and guesses where the

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,850
partitions are fixes your partition

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,310
table for you and you're good together I

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:51,870
I almost broke down crying when I

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,610
accidentally pointed a partition table

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,630
operation at the wrong drive which was

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,060
where I had all of my photography and I

00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,300
did some googling contests as it saved

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,040
it like that so important tool for me

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,480
important tool for anyone who might

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,720
accidentally screw up their partition

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,730
tables and then photorec and I'm

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,070
pointing it here at a backup feeding

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:21,760
drive so I'll use DD if I have a SD card

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,800
that I suspect has photos on it but

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,220
they're inaccessible to the operating

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,170
system for instance I used to work at a

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,060
school and I had a student come in in

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,000
tears because she had accidentally

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,530
formatted her SD card after taking a lot

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,690
of photographs at one of our events as a

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,040
it's okay calm down I'll do what I can

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,400
and I'll let you know

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,770
well she had just formatted it she had

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,690
over written anything so the way the

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,760
computers work there when you format it

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,590
or when you delete something it doesn't

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,590
actually remove it from the disk it just

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,230
removes the the little pointer that lets

00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,090
you find it so photo record which comes

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,500
with test disk which is why I didn't put

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,240
the apt-get install on here these are

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,910
part of the same suite from the same

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:11,400
people you'll see it's from CD security

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:13,140
board so photorec has a really really

00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,000
nice net curses based interface for

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,830
these two you just type the command in

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,170
and basically it guides you through it

00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,540
which disk do you want to try to save

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,220
I'll point it at a VV file rather than

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,570
the disk especially if there's some part

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,550
where failures for several reasons which

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,590
I won't necessarily get into depth to so

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,230
I can serve it the rest of the tools and

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:39,540
then it goes through and finds

00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:44,070
everything it can and dumps it out for

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,360
you so I have definitely had a lot of

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,370
things not just images

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,570
although images is the main reason I

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,020
would use it

00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:55,410
I've definitely saved some people some

00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:59,280
hard and so these three tools while they

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,890
don't directly involve photography per

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,230
se are tools that I as a photographer

00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:10,220
have used a lot of times to save money

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:14,040
so moving on to the sort of largest

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,050
image editing command-line tool out

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,370
there I'm not going to go too far into

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,050
this image magic is amazing it's got a

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,070
command line component and it's got

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:29,220
libraries for just about every language

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,750
that I've ever thought to use so I'll

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,840
mention the two big commands that I use

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,620
are convert and modify and they take a

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:42,030
lot of the same switches but convert you

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,800
pass it a an input file and you pass it

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,350
an output pop and it takes the input

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,060
file does something to it spits

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:53,460
with if you don't give that any switches

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,380
but you change the exception there it

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,630
will understand that what you're asking

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,500
it to do for reading the JPEG and right

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:06,620
out of Jeff gif sorry

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:09,920
MOG reply is different in that convert

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,980
will only work on one file at a time

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,160
whereas MOG Rifai you can pass it a

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:19,110
bunch of files and in this case what I'm

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,130
telling it to do is to read all of the

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,870
TIF files and change the format to JPEG

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:29,070
so it will know to write them back out

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:31,290
as a JPEG convert will also let you do

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,120
things like resizing it'll take a

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,460
percentage to make it a relative size

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,750
from the original or it'll take a

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:42,060
specific size which will it will shrink

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,510
it keeping it at the same aspect ratio

00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,940
to fit that size I used that a lot for

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,070
this presentation because I have very

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,350
large photos and in order to get it to

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:59,040
fit on my really old slow computer with

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,640
1024 by 768 vga output these slides were

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,850
super super slow until i decided i was

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,280
going to go through and resize them down

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,490
they looted what I needed and suddenly

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,100
the performance increased a lot so it'll

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,110
also do things like rotate here if you

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,540
put a explanation point it'll change the

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,220
aspect ratio I invite you to go see the

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,840
image magic documentation it is

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,970
excellent if there's a specific thing

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,700
you want to do with your images it will

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,160
do them but yeah I can do a lot of stuff

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,520
this image here is created on the

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,920
command line by image magic and I

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,860
totally copied this from there

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,810
I'd like you to go check it out but you

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:41,920
know we gives it the size of the image

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,510
it describes it how in very specific

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:51,949
every little detail here so I move on I

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:54,019
shoot in RAW a lot I've moved less

00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:55,880
towards this because it's so time

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:59,449
intensive too much to work with them

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,690
later raw files are to JPEG files

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:05,839
what negatives used to be to actual

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,329
physical prints if you have your

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,149
negative you can go back and reprint it

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,190
if you have their negative and correct

00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,320
for a lot of things but if all you have

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,699
is a print then you don't have all of

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,760
the information that was there to begin

00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:21,920
with so it's kind of like taking a

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,600
photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,639
if you always go back to the original

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,160
you're gonna get better results than if

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,190
you start working from a point further

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,279
down the stream this is the GUI

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:36,920
interface for UF raw it also comes with

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,750
a plug in for the and more

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,560
importantly for this time it has a batch

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,680
processor so if I take an image that I

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,519
like let's say I went and took a lot of

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,279
photographs in the same light situation

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,470
but I had the wrong light setting on my

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:58,640
camera they might come out a weird color

00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:00,980
I can go into raw and say hey this is a

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,290
neutral color I want you to what they

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,699
call white balance the image so that the

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:11,240
whites look white and if I wanted to do

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:13,459
that for 200 photographs in us raw I

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,089
would have to go through each image and

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:20,600
do that luckily they let you create an

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:24,170
ID file instead of or in addition to

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,980
outputting a new JPEG so in this example

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,010
here I have a file oh five three IMG

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,040
underscore over

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:35,070
JPG I have applied all of the color

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,280
correction in the GUI I use the GUI a

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:42,330
lot for figuring things out and then how

00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,660
I output it an IB final so here I tell

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,000
us raw batch I've got this configuration

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,370
file that I want you to apply to every

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,280
single raw in this directory I only had

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,200
a few here for the example but I've done

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,150
this for several hundred images and

00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,070
instead of sitting there for every

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,810
single image and telling it what I

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,770
wanted to do and saving out each file

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,230
individually

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:13,710
I said apply this over there and then I

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:15,330
want got copy J head is yes yes we

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,040
thought you authorized a text file you

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,620
can go in you can generate that by

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,840
yourself I only use the GUI because if

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:27,060
it's started yes absolutely and you can

00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:33,150
programmatically change that right

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:36,000
because it's so JPEGs have a lot of

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,560
information in them about them in a

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,530
header at the beginning of the file

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:47,010
called exit and sometimes it's useful to

00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,800
go in and tweak that so a couple of

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,390
things if you ever go to open an image

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,760
in the and it's telling you

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:57,420
something about the rotation is weird do

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,220
you want us to fix it or not there's a

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,650
couple of things you can do with the

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,589
EXIF data you can either tell Jay head

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,500
like hey figure out the rotation and

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,510
instead of having that as a part of the

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,500
header just fix the image to be in the

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:17,459
right rotation because normally normally

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,000
these days the camera is not saving the

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,190
file portrait if it's portrait and

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,350
landscape if it's landscape it saves

00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,280
them all landscape and then sometimes it

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,620
just puts in a little piece of

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,390
information that says oh by the way I

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:35,040
think this image is supposed to be

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,890
portrait so by telling it auto rotate

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:41,660
this Jay had will go

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:44,000
in and actually change the image to fit

00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,620
what it's supposed to be or if you don't

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,570
care about that you can strip all the

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,290
information out sometimes the camera can

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:56,059
be wrong believe it or not a big one

00:17:51,290 --> 00:18:01,309
that I've done is to fix a time stamp

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:04,309
drift so I had a camera that every time

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,460
I turned it off and turned it back on it

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:11,059
reset to January first two thousand at

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:13,040
midnight which is super frustrating and

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,419
take a bunch of photographs and then I

00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,380
would take a bunch of photographs and

00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:17,390
that would take a bunch of photographs

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,530
and then would it when I want to sort

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:22,040
them by date they were kind of

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,809
interleaved all on that date so one

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,140
thing that I could do with j-hat is tell

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:31,730
it I want you for this batch for this

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:35,020
batch of photos whatever whatever that

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,760
reset time is from a January 1st 2000

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,370
this is the actual time that that

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,400
corresponds to and it will take them all

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,809
and shift them into that time space so

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,700
they're relative to each other they'll

00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:51,500
be correct another thing is if sometimes

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,030
with daylight savings time there your

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,820
time is going to be off by exactly an

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,610
hour you can add or remove an hour super

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,860
quick to a hole and this is all very

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,240
quick it's not actually opening the

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,620
image and looking at it and doing

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,210
anything with it there's a very tiny

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,760
amount of data than that header file but

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,120
it needs to work with so this one's

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,760
really interesting to me I had two

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,429
photographers at my wedding they had two

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,669
different cameras and then I had other

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,610
people with their own cameras and none

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,510
of them were in sync right everyone had

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:28,340
a different

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:31,910
but using J head I was able to tell it I

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:36,830
know this camera is 53 seconds faster

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:38,390
than this one so shrink you know take 53

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,549
seconds away from this camera and

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,070
suddenly they're lined up correctly in

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,720
time like when you go to sort things by

00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,720
okay and then

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,920
in order to have the same facility of

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,679
sorting when you are using something

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,799
that doesn't look at XF data like just a

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,610
regular file browser you can go ahead

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:07,620
and rename or create a new file from the

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,170
old one based on the time stamp so that

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,020
every image in your directory the first

00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,929
part of the name is year month day hour

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,150
minute and then actually reply so for my

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,870
wedding I had four or five different

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:25,540
sources of images after I took all the

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,480
exit data and lined it up I renamed all

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,940
the files and then now when I go through

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,370
using I have no more something and go

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,130
through the each file they're coming at

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,780
me in chronological order it doesn't

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,520
matter which camera they came from if

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,230
this person took a picture than that one

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,299
than this one in this one again I'll see

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,510
them in that order so I really enjoyed

00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:48,760
finding this tool and it took me like 10

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,320
minutes from saying I bet there's a tool

00:20:48,760 --> 00:21:00,669
for that I wonder what there is and

00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:02,049
actually getting my results and those

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:11,200
are the two formats of things i have

00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:14,559
access it also will go in and recreate

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,720
thumbnails or you can set some like you

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,419
can fiddle around because exit also has

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,390
will let you put in a small version of

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:25,210
the large file for the kinds of programs

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:30,120
that care about that kind of stuff and

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:34,480
sometimes for instance jake some less

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:38,200
less complex jpeg programs will strip

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:43,450
all that exif data out and then j head

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:47,679
will let you recreate it so human i'm

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:51,120
going to point out a few things that

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,309
this does humans a great unix-style

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,309
panorama stitcher and that's what they

00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:57,529
call it a pentagram

00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:59,570
stitcher but it really is just a

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:02,240
marvelous way of combining images in

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,580
lots of different ways so what these

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,980
three examples were were my camera on a

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:10,129
tripod and I just took a whole bunch of

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,740
photographs and then threw them at human

00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,240
and it automatically figured out how

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:22,580
they all fit together created the

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:24,529
panoramas for me but when you f get

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,169
installed again it comes with all the

00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:30,889
command line utilities for so here's the

00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:34,340
vertical ones it's it you'll see the

00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:37,580
projection situation because it's

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,100
actually taking that data and then

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,649
thinking about it in 3d space and then

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,499
letting you reproject it so when you

00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:47,389
take it from the same point if you take

00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:49,730
photographs in all directions that's

00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:51,740
theoretically a sphere and then you can

00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,220
tell Hugin how you want that projected

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,409
out which if you've seen maps of the

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,330
earth which is a sphere represented flat

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,029
you can see that there's distortions and

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,059
things that would be useful to correct

00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,259
I'll repeat from earlier if any of you

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:08,320
in the back are interested in the

00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,940
command line stuff that's gonna show up

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,330
that'll probably be more legible from

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:19,070
the front half of the room so human ways

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:22,429
of combining images so this is six

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,350
different images which are exposed that

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:26,720
from it so they were taken at the same

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,389
time from the same place but they were

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,830
taken at several different exposure

00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:36,619
levels why well if you can see the sky

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,929
and the detail of the sky you can't see

00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:42,590
any of the darkness over here

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:45,289
it's just underexposed but if you can

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:49,009
see what's going on over here on land

00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:50,960
then the sky is overexposed so the

00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,870
dynamic range of a photograph

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,270
is limited and that's just optics you

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:59,840
know that's a limitation of the real

00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:01,909
world so in order to pretend that we can

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,860
capture all of that information in one

00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:09,260
image we take a whole bunch of different

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:11,179
images and you tell Hugin i want you to

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,010
take all these images figure out the

00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:17,059
best parts of them and slap them

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:20,929
together so for a high dynamic range

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,820
I tell it so first I align them because

00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:25,490
if you're hand holding a camera there's

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,440
gonna be a little bit of movement so

00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,299
Huguette comes with an align image step

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,700
command that's excellent and they will

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:34,490
it will correct and move them all so

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:38,450
that the same pixel location is going to

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:41,690
be the same spot of each image then even

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:45,289
comes with a tool called infused and if

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,120
you don't tell it anything else what it

00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:49,700
does is it figures out the best exposure

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,190
combines them all together and give you

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,890
your output five so from those six

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,399
images you get one image where the sky

00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,730
is less visible and you can see the

00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,559
sunset as well at well you you could on

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,169
the original sorry projectors don't

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,520
really do photography justice and you

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:11,000
can still see the detail here in the

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,580
ground if you look online for HDR photos

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,649
some of them look really weird and alien

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,480
and that's because you don't usually

00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:22,640
you're not easily able to see that huge

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,679
dynamic range so combining images

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,080
another thing I like to do with you get

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,899
is focus stacking so another limit of

00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,570
optics and the real world is that there

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:35,750
is a thing called depth of field when

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:37,809
you take a photograph of something it

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,630
will be sharp assuming you have it

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:44,750
correctly focus but there's there's a

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,480
duck in front of which and behind which

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,679
you're not going to see any detail and

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,110
that has a function

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,149
the size of the aperture that you're

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,399
taking and you may not have control over

00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:57,080
that depending on the light it's also a

00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,809
function of the focal length of your

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,610
lens which sometimes you have control

00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:05,169
with the zoom knob and it's also a

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:07,940
function of the distance that you were

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:09,889
of the focus which is what you're

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,960
changing when you change when you turn

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:14,090
the focus ring as you're realigning the

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,799
pieces of glass so that that distance

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,960
between your camera and the thing that

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:23,269
you're focusing on can slide back and

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,820
forth so this is 13 images of a chip of

00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:28,100
RAM and unfortunately you can't see the

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,460
detail but you might take my word for it

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,710
that the one over here you can see the

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,309
very front of the chip of Graham but you

00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,350
can't see anything else and then I moved

00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:40,879
the focus ring just a tiny bit took

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:44,690
another picture tiny bit took another

00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:48,740
picture so the one back here this chip

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:52,549
on the RAM is visible in InFocus but

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,710
nothing else is so the focus glides back

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:57,200
further and further from the camera as

00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:59,509
you look through all these and then I

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,059
tell you again to align that in the step

00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:05,419
because again I was physically touching

00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:09,409
the camera which meant it was moving so

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:12,440
Hugin goes through and puts them all on

00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:15,409
the right space for each other and then

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I use the same command in fuse to blend

00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:20,869
them this time though I tell infuse the

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,009
thing that I care about isn't exposure

00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:26,869
I tell it way exposure nothing zero so

00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,610
use help from zero to one what how

00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:30,320
important is this to you and figuring it

00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,559
out I don't care about exposure

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,659
exploding your zero I don't care about

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,580
saturation saturation zero what I care

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:39,049
about is contrast and that's how

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,419
mathematically we can tell whether or

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:44,299
not something is in focus if this pixel

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:45,950
is very similar to the pixel next to

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,779
which is very similar to the pixel next

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,399
to it that might be blurred but if

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,820
there's a high contrast between those

00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:55,070
two pixels it must be in focus so it

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,889
goes through loads all those images up

00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,509
puts them all together and also I put

00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:03,049
down here on the bottom some image magic

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:05,570
commands ma graph I take that take those

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,690
TIFF files format them as JPEG and

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,619
resize them to 300 by 300 take the

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,409
stacked last one and resize up to 800 by

00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:17,599
600 why because they were giant images

00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:20,599
and this presentation was super slow

00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:24,200
until I shrank them and slapped them in

00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:26,509
there so this one image pretends to have

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,329
had the depth the maximum depth of field

00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:31,519
available to me because I had a cranked

00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:33,589
in one direction up here and then I

00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,629
slowly added information all the way

00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:38,119
back there so they're combined and here

00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:40,190
it seems like we are looking at one

00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:42,919
image that has all of that in focus

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,940
focus tacking is used a lot with macro

00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,879
photography insects are really

00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:52,820
fascinating in macro but you don't see

00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:55,219
very much detail so they use this trick

00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:00,229
to make it seem like you can see that

00:28:55,219 --> 00:29:02,059
much stuff G photo 2 is an awesome tool

00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:05,690
that I've used both on the command line

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:08,599
and with libraries GT cam is the GUI

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,739
front-end most of your DSLR cameras will

00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:14,539
have a USB cable so Gigi can lets you

00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:17,119
control the camera the way that you

00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:19,429
would on the menu of the camera so you

00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,129
can set the time you can set you know

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,839
the name the copyright information all

00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:27,529
kinds of settings on your camera through

00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:31,700
the GUI or on the command line so this

00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:36,320
example here would have been used to

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,839
take game HDR type images so this is a

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,640
script that says for these five numbers

00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,310
13 14

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,290
15 16 and 17 which correspond to some

00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,450
exposure values and I'm not going to get

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,430
into do the following set the

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,180
configuration so that the exposure

00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:55,330
compensation is this very next capture

00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:58,090
an image and downloaded at the end set

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,830
the cup exposure back to normal okay so

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,480
that would that would take five images

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:06,220
and then set your camera back to the way

00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:09,370
it was so I same kind of bracketing but

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:14,890
this time was speed and I'm illustrating

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:17,950
by holding the my sink down so that the

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:21,430
water is coming out super fast so this

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,410
is set the shutter speed to two seconds

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,080
to one sixtieth of a second and to one

00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:29,350
four thousandths of a second take those

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,970
pictures you know what a time that said

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,400
it the sugars being back to my normal

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,500
setting which is 1/60 of a second so

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,420
this is the two-second exposure you

00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,850
can't see anything this is the normal

00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,800
one which you know looks okay and then

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,390
this is the 1/4 thousandth of a second

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:48,520
which freezes that water and you can see

00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:52,600
each individual problem I use G photo to

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:55,210
do this time lapse I've just folded hey

00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,730
capture and download that image and then

00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,410
I threw an interval at it and it

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,240
understands if there's an interval that

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,270
you wanted to take multiple photographs

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:11,470
in this case 30 seconds apart I did this

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:13,420
one for 24 hours then I threw it at em

00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,810
encoder and the decoder is a front end

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,200
to a lot of different encoding stuff in

00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:28,090
this case I I gave it a folder full of

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:30,010
JPEGs for something I give it a name for

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,600
the file I wanted to come out I told it

00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,070
the scale at which I wanted cuz these

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,899
were much larger photographs than I

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:37,419
really was going to be

00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:41,859
here anyways and then I said I want you

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:45,279
to use the l8l API code there lidi

00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:46,989
format the hell api codec for creating

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,909
the format into which the things are

00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:52,509
gonna go the codec for encoding the

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:54,609
video I gave it the options of using em

00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:57,369
JPEGs of trying to compress that video a

00:31:54,609 --> 00:32:03,669
little bit and then told it to output an

00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:09,969
avi so that's what was there motion is

00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:11,679
an interesting little demon this is an

00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:14,679
art installation that I helped set up

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,200
from the technical side of things it's

00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,339
at the unmuting in Cincinnati where it

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,469
was I'm not sure if that's still there

00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:24,279
and you can check it out as impression

00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:27,159
duck kiss on Instagram motion is a demon

00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:31,749
that does motion detection you plug it

00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:34,450
plug a webcam in and it will look

00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:38,259
through that webcam at any time that

00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:40,479
there's a change it will save it out so

00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,099
I used it to try to figure out what was

00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:45,070
going on with some rodents in my house

00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:50,679
and you know where they were when I

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:52,419
wasn't around and then I was inspired to

00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,489
use the same thing for this art

00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,979
installation because what it is is

00:32:54,489 --> 00:33:01,330
there's a computer and then there's a

00:32:56,979 --> 00:33:02,769
webcam pointing at a mirror and the

00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,599
artists we're trying to figure out what

00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:06,909
can we can you help us figure out how to

00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:09,399
set it up so that like when they sit

00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:11,529
down there's like a pressure plate that

00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:13,479
takes picture or or maybe we can use

00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:15,309
lasers and if they cross the laser we'll

00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:17,710
take a picture and I was like well why

00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,779
don't we just take all the pictures and

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,499
only save the ones we care about so

00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:25,119
using motion detection and a mask which

00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:26,619
you can feed into motion as they only

00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,250
care about this part of the picture when

00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:30,710
somebody interacts with here's a part of

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,200
picture save that information off so

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,600
this little into machine was right this

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,780
demon saving all kinds of stuff into

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,760
their Dropbox directory and then Dropbox

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,350
was sinking it up to the Internet and so

00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,420
at home they would look through all the

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:50,990
images find the cool ones and slap them

00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:56,090
up on Instagram so this is the long

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:59,150
frustrating part of why I got super into

00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,220
the following tools I've got a job at

00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,860
Salesforce recently and I moved to

00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,200
Indianapolis they had just recently

00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,690
bought the naming rights to the tallest

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,260
building in the state which was formerly

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:14,139
known as Chase Tower I had moved down

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,510
there I was fiddling around with my

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,000
camera as I tend to do and I I set my

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:24,440
camera up to take a time-lapse of the

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,260
skyline from my apartment when I did the

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,270
time-lapse and I went to view it what I

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,870
found was that they were taking down the

00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,610
chase time and so I got a time-lapse of

00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,370
the skyline while they were taking down

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:40,000
the chase line I used some of these

00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:43,100
tools that I'm about to speak about to

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,530
capture just the part that had the chase

00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,450
design and I posted that to my company

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,830
social network and I said hey guys check

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:53,210
this out isn't that kind of interesting

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:55,580
and people kind of liked it so I thought

00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,670
wouldn't it be cool if I got been

00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,310
putting the sign up but I'd like to get

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,560
the whole process so I got ahold of a

00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,680
lady in real estate and she liked my

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,880
idea so she gave me use of an office on

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,120
the south side

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,890
so they took down the sign on the north

00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,420
side and then they took down the side

00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,010
outside and they put up the sign on the

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,660
people's outside and to put up a sign on

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,549
the Northside so there was this whole

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,880
period of time when they were working up

00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:24,680
there and I just set up because we had

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,269
no idea when we just have some time in

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,700
the next month they're going to do it I

00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:33,349
just set my camera about a tree to take

00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:35,750
pictures indefinitely so these were

00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:41,170
these were something like 12 megapixel

00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:41,170
pictures one per minute for 21 days I

00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:47,660
used magic lantern not a command-line

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,269
utility but I want to push them because

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:54,710
they're awesome magic lantern is a hack

00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:58,579
for lots of different cameras I use it

00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:00,920
on my candidate you can it's a firm work

00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:02,890
it's it's not a firmware upgrade but

00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,049
uses the firmware upgrade facility of

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:08,119
the camera so you save a little file

00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:09,950
onto your sd card you pop it in here can

00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,170
and you run the firmware update facility

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,019
and what it does is it installs magic

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,789
lantern to that SD card so you can take

00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,730
the SD card out put another one in is

00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:23,029
right back to normal you can put your

00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:26,359
magic lantern SD card in you got magic

00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:28,099
magic lantern it gives you all the

00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:36,950
features that Canon didn't want to give

00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:39,319
you they don't support it incidentally

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:42,529
I'm using magic lantern right now to get

00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:46,190
around a feature in feature a business

00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:49,009
limitation of modern Canon cameras is

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,170
that they are restricted to 30 minute

00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:53,779
videos there's no reason for that except

00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,420
line here maybe European tax law I don't

00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,890
know but it's irritating and this

00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,910
presentation is longer than 30 minutes

00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:04,640
so magic lantern on my camera I told it

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:06,500
when the video stops started another

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,119
video then I'm going to take the two

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,130
into month there's going to be about a

00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:12,940
one-second cut off in there at one point

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,940
but

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:24,120
so I have 21 days of one photograph per

00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:28,200
minute and basic file management is a

00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:30,420
nightmare it's just a horrible horrible

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,730
nightmare so normally when I'm working

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,130
on photography I will use the GUI like I

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,960
just opened up the folder the thumbnails

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,680
are great I can find the stuff I want

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,560
but when you have tens of thousands of

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,000
photos it really slows things down like

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,030
I have a brand I just bought a new

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,920
computer that has eight cores like 16

00:37:48,030 --> 00:38:01,650
gigs of ram and it's just it's it choke

00:37:52,920 --> 00:38:03,510
hard every time I tried to work so it

00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,700
wasn't fun anymore that's my big point I

00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,670
was like but I committed to doing this

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,980
project I was like hey if you let me set

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,650
up my camera I'll take a time-lapse and

00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,780
then I'll share it with the company and

00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:19,440
it wasn't fun anymore so I had to figure

00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,000
out how to script it one of the big

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,250
problems that I had to figure out how to

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,980
get around for all the different folders

00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:29,490
and files so as the result of legacy

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:33,540
file systems fat the file location table

00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:35,060
file system all the images that you get

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,300
out of Canon cameras and most

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,820
professional cameras are limited in the

00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,640
way that they so all the images out of a

00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,120
Canon camera are IMG underscore and then

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,850
for numbers JPEG or CR - for the rods I

00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,840
took all of these in JPEG because bras

00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,840
were far too large

00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:00,819
then they get also put into folders

00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:03,140
because they understand sometimes

00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:05,990
they're gonna buy a camera and take more

00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,809
than 10 thousand photographs with it so

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:13,069
every time it rolls over from 9 9 9 9 8

00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:15,109
headed back to 0 0 0 1 it creates a new

00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:17,690
folder so the first one is 100 Canon

00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:22,039
that's 101 Canon and that's 102 canon

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:25,099
but if you take and copy all your images

00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,329
off it goes back to 101 camera so if you

00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,190
were just to try to throw everything

00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,519
into one folder there's all kinds of

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,710
name collision issues that come up with

00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,079
so what I tend to do is I create a

00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,970
folder called dump oh one and I put

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,609
everything in there and then Dumbo - and

00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:44,059
I'll put everything in there so this is

00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:47,269
the tree of images that I had for this

00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:50,029
project so I had dump one and all the

00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:52,480
images in there Doug - had 100 Canon and

00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:55,400
101 Canon and all the images from those

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,989
all the way through to dump 7 had 100

00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,489
cam and a bunch of them in there so I

00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:03,349
had 16 total directories with 32,000 675

00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:05,749
files to work with each of about 6

00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:09,829
megabytes and I was totally joking my

00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:14,210
workflow and your scripting this is

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:19,249
super basic file utils in Ruby all I did

00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:21,829
is go through and so alphabetically

00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:23,720
because of the way I name things if they

00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:26,150
were ordered alphabetically they were in

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,460
the correct order so I just said take

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,920
all the originals and create a link

00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,380
folder so it doesn't take so each link

00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,359
doesn't take up a file it's just a

00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:39,499
pointer it's like a Windows shortcut but

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:44,119
better and in that links directory start

00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:45,980
at 0 0 0 0 1 dot jpg and I move on up so

00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,829
now I have a folder called links that

00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,839
has references to all of my photographs

00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:52,890
if I make a mistake I can just delete

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,520
that links directory

00:40:52,890 --> 00:41:01,200
no big deal still this one folder if I

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,720
try to open it up it's gonna choke my

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,430
file manager - because each of these

00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,720
images is almost 6 million 6 megabytes

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,580
the size of it goes up and down

00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,420
depending on the complexity of the image

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,550
and I in order to work with it wanted to

00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,770
kind of make thumbnail size ones so that

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,630
I can tell which ones had the

00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:23,070
information that cared about because

00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,690
what I was going to do was just delete

00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,250
everything I didn't care about and say

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,410
what was left to make a video out of it

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:33,390
so in order to shrink them to this size

00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:35,609
I used image matter this is just the

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,609
same stuff from one of my first slides

00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:41,570
in a Ruby script format so I went

00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:43,920
through for every image and shrunk it

00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,190
one thing that was frustrating to me was

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,470
every time I worked with imagemagick it

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,369
pegged one of my eight CPUs and the rest

00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:56,700
of my computer set doing nothing so in

00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:58,950
Ruby I took all of the files in that

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,570
links directory broke it up into eight

00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:05,580
equally sized chunks of files forked 8

00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,010
processes and told each of those

00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,869
processes these are the images you work

00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,040
on these are the images you work on and

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:16,290
so I actually got my whole computer

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,270
finally after buying it I finally got

00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:23,359
all the processors doing something I

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:27,450
cared about and it was kind of it was

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,869
then also a similar structure for my

00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:33,930
Ruby script on this one I took all of

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:35,910
the edges in that smaller thumbnail

00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:38,369
directory that still existed because

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,790
they had names corresponding to the

00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:41,770
original ones in the

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:44,380
directory right I said all of the

00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:47,680
surviving images and the small image

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:52,540
directory find the link to the original

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:58,680
file for that crop it to the part of the

00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,680
image I cared about rotate it because it

00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:03,820
like I mentioned with the XF data this

00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:06,150
is what the JPEG files look like but I

00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:14,800
wanted this part of the image that way

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:19,030
so this says go to 43 45 by 50 25 take

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,460
an image that's 336 by 573 square rotate

00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:25,780
it 90 degrees and write that out to

00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:29,830
another folder my crop rotated logo

00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,710
folder and so this one spun around for a

00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:35,320
while all eight of my processors working

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,720
on their images and then when that was

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,540
all done I had one folder see our logo

00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,690
that had only the images I cared about

00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:47,050
only the part of them I cared about

00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:48,160
rotated correctly and then I used

00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:52,510
another pen back

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,700
I told it a 33 30 frames per second say

00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,180
all of these files

00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,180
give me an AVI

00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:09,989
so it took me a long time to make this

00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:13,369
video is this like one frame per it's

00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:16,799
one frame per minute but I cut out a lot

00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:19,049
so this is three weeks worth of images

00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:22,949
only the parts of it that I cared about

00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:25,619
and I I took the last day that they had

00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:27,779
the chase sign on so at the beginning

00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,209
the chase sign was lit and it turned off

00:44:27,779 --> 00:44:31,709
and it goes and then I cut everything

00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,199
out until they actually did the work of

00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:35,609
tearing down the chase sign and the each

00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:38,190
of the times that they work on it you

00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:39,989
know it took several days so they tore

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,880
down the they pulled down the little

00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:43,949
bits of the chase logo and they tore

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,660
down the backdrop and they put up a new

00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:49,519
backdrop and they put up some of those

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,079
signage and they made mistakes which I

00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:56,190
have forgiven them for by removing

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,009
images they kind of they brought it up

00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:02,519
maybe upside down or something but I saw

00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:04,680
them move it over and over it back and

00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:07,529
then back over at that time they touched

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:11,459
it and then a couple times so this isn't

00:45:07,529 --> 00:45:13,739
totally idealized pretending to be one

00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:18,599
day of work but it actually was spread

00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:21,779
around three cheeks and that is the

00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:26,359
extent of my slides I'm open for

00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:26,359
questions and I think we're good on time

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,080
have you ever done something where you

00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:38,610
combine them with the previous image to

00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:45,330
clean up I haven't go no but I think

00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:47,460
human which does the image stacking one

00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,440
thing I didn't get to do which I would

00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:54,870
have liked to do was using that align

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,340
image tag tool to correct for because it

00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,910
wasn't super pronounced which is why I

00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,320
gave up on really caring about it but

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,270
the camera did move a little bit over

00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,670
the course of those three weeks and it

00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,470
kind of like glided down a tiny bit so

00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:11,220
the first few images are a few pixels

00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:14,220
higher in the next view so I've seen

00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:17,790
people use that tool that you can suite

00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,140
to take like shaky video I don't know if

00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:22,860
you've ever seen like the Star Trek

00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:25,590
bridge woman they they mathematically

00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:28,080
keep it from shaking it's pretty funny

00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:30,900
but I've seen I've seen people and

00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,840
tutorials for using that tool to fix

00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,360
camera shake in software and I think

00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,900
I've seen people use it to correct for

00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,900
noise as well

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,369
[Music]

00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:57,819
I haven't I haven't had a need for that

00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:58,839
myself I don't know if J had wood it

00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:01,299
might be worth looking into

00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:03,640
it's a that's a fairly mature product

00:47:01,299 --> 00:47:06,609
and I wouldn't be surprised since it's a

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,959
an analogous issue if they say oh well

00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:19,599
let's just consider these two different

00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:22,809
formats of the same thing no I'm not

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,489
aware of just my graphics magic or at

00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:27,549
some point so it's always interesting to

00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:29,979
know like where things are people who

00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:32,739
use them well I have not used graphics

00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:35,649
magic myself I haven't used graphics

00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:41,039
magic I got started with imagemagick and

00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:41,039
I haven't really felt a need to move

00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:59,680
what a news em encoder first so the time

00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,109
lapse

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,890
the first time lapse I took a couple of

00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:08,769
years ago and then most recently I used

00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:12,519
ffmpeg I understand that and then coda

00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:14,709
will use ffmpeg if it needs to so it's

00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:17,349
kind of another layer abstracted from

00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:19,509
what's going on I didn't have I don't

00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:23,789
have a really great reason for that the

00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:29,170
big one big thing I'd say about this one

00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:31,869
is that I was really looking at quality

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:34,119
I didn't want to compress it at all I

00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:35,949
took this and I threw it up to YouTube

00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:38,890
and let YouTube deal with the

00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:40,900
compression and everything so I don't

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,549
know if these days I would I would

00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,349
prefer somebody else do that figuring

00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:47,410
out what the best compression and

00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:49,769
everything is and back then that wasn't

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,769
really available

00:48:54,150 --> 00:49:00,569
as long as what it does is just give you

00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:02,569
the command line at the end then I would

00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:10,529
probably wind up taking a look at that

00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:13,319
but usually at this point I just yeah

00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:14,640
there's a some of there's two different

00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,710
things there's magical answer and

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,150
there's a CH PK you know if there's

00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:20,420
slight difference between them and are

00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:24,690
they like paddle on the same cameras

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:27,359
there are definitely differences chdk is

00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:29,190
actually a cannon hack and it works

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,039
primarily on Canon cameras if I

00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:35,309
understand correctly and it might

00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:38,039
replace the software on your camera okay

00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:40,650
magic lantern is a much more Universal

00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,869
tool in that it supports thousands of

00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,430
cameras you can go to the Magic Lantern

00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:47,789
site and they've got a list so you can

00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:50,460
check compatibility but I'll tell you

00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:53,099
the big difference for me because I knew

00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:55,140
about chdk but not magic lantern is I

00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:57,569
went to try to get chdk to get it to

00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,819
work on my camera and the instructions

00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:01,230
for that were seriously complex and I

00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:05,160
don't know that I was able to find the

00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,989
exact firmware for my exact model but

00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,180
while I was searching for that magic

00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:10,829
lantern came up and I just I took a

00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,720
glance at it and I was like well that

00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:15,509
sounds interesting if that works and

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,859
what I need and like literally five

00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:18,749
minutes later it was up and running on

00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:22,380
my camera cool I just downloaded that

00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:24,660
file and updated the firmware alright so

00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,829
I missed a good portion of the beginning

00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,930
of your talk and I see that you're

00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:31,019
recording it is that gonna be available

00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,190
to watch just pretty much anywhere I

00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:33,989
hope so

00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,509
assuming that the video comes out

00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:38,069
correctly and well what I'm gonna

00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:39,740
probably do is throw it up on YouTube

00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:43,369
and then I'll share that on

00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:44,990
Alex bass bass bass okay

00:50:43,369 --> 00:51:10,010
hey guys my wife would talk definitely

00:50:44,990 --> 00:51:10,490
be interested in comments I have a full

00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:15,050
shelf

00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:17,690
I've got lenses I've got a power adapter

00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,880
for it some extra batteries and stuff

00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:23,060
three or four tripods

00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,760
I brought the monster pod or gorilla pod

00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:27,470
with me because I figured I would really

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:33,040
have the space to set up the big tripod

00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:33,040
and I worked all attached to that chair

00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:39,010
anything else I'm pretty close to time

00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:48,830
