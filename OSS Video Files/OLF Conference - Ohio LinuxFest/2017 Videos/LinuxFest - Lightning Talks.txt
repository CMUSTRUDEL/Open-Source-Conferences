00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,440
vertical cyst Atman it is a training and

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,090
consulting company and that's not what

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,330
I'm here to talk about on to a quick

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:17,490
survey about flame wars who here prefers

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:21,689
VI to Emacs most of the room who here

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:27,660
prefers Emacs to VI okay Lou here

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,250
prefers Firefox to Google Chrome okay

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,040
who here prefers Google Chrome to

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,260
Firefox all right who here prefers

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,050
Internet explorer

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,690
no one's admitted oh that guy over there

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,469
all right which which which well

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,469
flamewars am I missing

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,789
chromium okay you prefer chromium all

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,770
right fair enough

00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:56,780
tabs two spaces who prefers tabs over

00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,480
spaces okay who prefers spaces over tabs

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:05,750
okay who presses the tab key but has it

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,750
typed spaces into your editor yes good

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:10,979
so there's a funny thing about flame

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,500
wars which is that some people take them

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,630
very very seriously and some people get

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,439
get really you know there's there's a

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,509
reason why the xkcd forum for for flame

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,670
wars is called religious wars some

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,799
people take them very very seriously and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,950
some people like I do look at them as

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,140
sort of an entertaining form of

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,740
recreation right you can oh who prefers

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,619
Python to Pearl alright who prefers

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,820
Pearl to Python okay if it looks like

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:45,210
pythons winning that sorry guys and

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,310
ladies so there's something that's

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,110
interesting and I realized this sometime

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,030
in the last year about flame wars and

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,210
really most types of arguments the the

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,090
more intense the argument is you look at

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,399
it and it's very usual that the two

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,280
people who are arguing the most they

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,350
have so much in common and there's like

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,719
this little tiny difference that they

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,120
disagree on and so they have to blow

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,620
that up into a big huge fight so you get

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,209
two people and and they're both the

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,310
developers and they both you know

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:20,730
develop like web applications but one of

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,440
them uses a different editor and so they

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,659
fight about this that you won't find

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,180
them fighting with with like someone who

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,000
works in construction on like pipe

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,920
infrastructure for plumbing it's just

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,629
they're too dissimilar right so you you

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,549
look at an argument is between two

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,190
people who have so many things in common

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,450
and just a tip if you run into someone

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,090
who takes this sort of thing really

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,370
really seriously you just back off from

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,720
from from the flame war part of it you

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,489
know you want to try and defuse the

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,209
thing just talk about the things you

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,519
have in common

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,230
find something you both agree on and you

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,970
talk about that it will defuse it right

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,220
on down they'll go right and right into

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,780
communication with you and that's my

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,430
advice now there's another one I don't

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,980
know how many okay how many people in

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,459
here have a preference at all about

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,290
database database management system okay

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:12,290
just a couple people oh I'll still ask

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:15,269
how many people prefer Postgres to MySQL

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,060
okay how many people prefer MySQL T'Pau

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,310
okay for someone stood up just to raise

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,410
their hand how many people prefer MySQL

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:27,450
to Postgres okay a few people and this

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,190
here's just a funny question how many

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,190
people here prefer Linux to Windows

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,510
people here for for Windows to Linux and

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,260
are bold enough to admit it to this

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,449
audience no he just had an internet

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,819
explorer that's okay I think it still

00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,699
runs on Mac right how many people here

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:51,180
prefer more neutral right how many

00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,709
people here prefer Mac to Windows okay

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,139
how many people here prefer Windows to

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,120
Mac this is just this is just out of

00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,609
curiosity you know I see what the what

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,919
the percentages are like okay so so

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,949
there's three parts to understanding and

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,299
one of them is reality or agreement and

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,030
you want to find something that you

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,870
agree on and another part is affinity or

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,340
how much you like someone and you when

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,380
you like so it also has to do with

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,419
consideration of space you're gonna be

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,070
closer or farther you want to be farther

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,890
away from someone that you don't like

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,630
and then the third part is communication

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,919
you take these three parts put them

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,380
together you get understanding

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
when you

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,240
increase the agreement you'll increase

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,860
the communication so if you want to talk

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,770
to someone find something you agree on

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,170
talk talk to them about that and you

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,000
maintain the high affinity by

00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,220
recognizing that there's something you

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,380
can like about that person and that's

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,180
based on the works of l ron Hubbard you

00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,010
can look it up very useful and getting

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,730
into communication with people so that's

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,160
just my tips on defusing flame wars and

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,720
it works on managers - you find what you

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,270
can agree on with them and talk about

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,060
that and hey maybe you even don't get

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:04,950
fired as a result I'm that's all I got

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,950
big hand for Mike passed it on Mike

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,820
started working on it's called simp SI

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:15,010
MP it's available at simp - project comm

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,140
I actually just got a new job working

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,660
for a company that develops simp and

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,850
supports it and it's called onyx point

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,940
if any of you happen to be in the market

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,860
for that kind of thing the it does

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,580
compliance and so if you you know if

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:38,970
you're in an environment that's you know

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:41,320
audited for this PCI Sox etc et-cetera

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,990
might be able to help you out okay so

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,330
now now that I spent less than a minute

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,370
talking about that I actually John

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,010
inspired me to bring up something else

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,570
so I've been running Linux users group

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:59,050
since 1994 okay I've been coming to this

00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:02,200
since I think the third one so long a

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,580
long time I I love talking to people I

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,300
love talking to people individually I

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,010
love talking in front of groups okay

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,560
it's a it's second nature I love it just

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,390
love doing it right but for some reason

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,910
you put a microphone in my hand and I'm

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,310
terrified okay I'm shaking up here right

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,290
now I don't know why it's a phobia it's

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,170
a weird thing what's even worse is

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,880
getting up on a stage and having a

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,000
microphone oh my god it's like it's

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,020
again to the world kind of stuff so

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,930
actually is kind of funny because last

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,930
year I was working for another company

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,669
it was real happy with my job and so

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,260
when lightning talks came up I always do

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,850
the lightning talks because I want to

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,510
I want to fight through this weird

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,870
phobia that I've got so when I got up to

00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,210
talk I did a little talk that I said I

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,190
called you're doing it wrong and some of

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,160
you might remember it I started to

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,930
deliver it and I realized really quickly

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,450
that it sounded like a stand-up routine

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,090
I didn't go into it thinking that okay

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,800
and so okay you know what's worse than

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,420
when you've got a weird phobia about

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
being on stage and having a microphone

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,070
and stuff - all of a sudden realize

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,220
you're doing a stand-up act okay oh my

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,560
god the wave of panic that hit me was

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,410
incredible

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,580
anyway fought through it did it and and

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,950
at least a couple of people enjoyed it

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,280
so that was that was cool

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:27,640
but anyway point of the story moral of

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,370
the story is if if public speaking makes

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,950
you uncomfortable all I can say is do it

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,520
okay find a friendly audience like this

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,230
one and do it if being in front of

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,600
people with a microphone makes you shake

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,050
like a leaf like I'm doing right now do

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,150
it

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,290
fight through it you will get better at

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,510
it it will help I I just always

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,370
encourage people just fight find out who

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,040
you know get out of your comfort zone

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,840
fight through these things and and and

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,670
you'll be better off for it and like say

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,730
you can't ask for a more friendly

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,150
audience than this place okay so that's

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,770
it

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:14,490
begin verse Steve okay yes my name is

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:19,570
Eric Hudson and I'm from Chicago and

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:25,330
this year I lost a longtime friend this

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:27,940
year he was 96 years old ever since I

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,030
was a kid I would visit him I would

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,700
visit him often you know my parents

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,510
thought that I spend too much time over

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,490
there you know you know I I mean I'd go

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,790
there and he didn't give me free

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,460
batteries and stuff like that you know I

00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:49,890
don't know me you guys maybe know him -

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,890
it was my local RadioShack store

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:58,820
and it's it's a shame that that they've

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,149
gone down now especially with all the

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,500
DIY maker movement market that's out

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:09,890
there now because you know you need a

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,209
place to go and buy a frickin part when

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,910
you're working on something when you're

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,620
really in and and working on this thing

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,630
and you're like all right and all I need

is this freaking pardon and I have to

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,029
wait for it for a week to come in or I

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,899
have to wait three weeks for it to come

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:38,750
right now today you know and someone

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:40,970
needs to come in and step in and fill

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,410
this void you know

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:47,180

you know maybe an arts and crafts store

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,760

thanks Eric past the mic along go for it

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,730
hi my name is Simone Ruiz and I make my

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,200
living working with Linux I did not make

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,980
my living working with Linux the first

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,730
time I came here I was doing another job

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,550
and doing Linux related to that but kind

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,640
of on the side so I got involved with

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:31,130
the community that's what I use to

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,500
educate myself and to get better at

00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,350
those skills as part of my involvement

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,720
with the community I went to my local

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:42,080
Linux users group I participated in

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,730
mailing lists I kind of wrote up a blog

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,080
with some of the solutions I was coming

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,470
up with the some of the problems that I

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,890
was having sort of as a direct result of

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:58,190
all of that I became aware of my next

00:11:51,890 --> 00:12:00,560
position which paid better and gave me a

00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,810
chance to work more with Linux I was

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,690
still doing sort of everything at a

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,020
school with Linux being a much bigger

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,350
part of it than at my job before that I

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,330
was at that job for about ten years this

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,280
whole time I have tried to remain as

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,730
active as I could with the community

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,740
coming here do ohio linux best as often

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:29,960
as possible I've only missed a couple of

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:32,540
years I then left that position and when

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,000
I started looking for a job an old

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,340
friend of mine who had I had met at a

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,830
Linux user group who I had brought here

00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,040
to Ohio Linux Fest got ahold of me and

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:47,330
said hey my company is hiring you should

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:51,260
apply and I did and I got a better job

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:54,260
that pays more and I do not have a

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:57,500
degree I do not have any formal training

00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,010
I learned everything on the job and I

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,720
would like to encourage anybody who

00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,430
loves anything you know I'm up here at a

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,980
Linux fest so I'm talking about Linux

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,230
but whatever it is that you're into get

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,339
involved with the community talk to

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,910
people about it publish about it

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:18,249
just do the thing that you love and do

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,189
it publicly so that people can see you

00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,680
do it and suddenly people will start

00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:25,649
thinking you know what you're doing and

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,930
suddenly people will start offering you

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:31,389
the opportunity to do it more and some

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,910
of those people might offer money for

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:35,589
you to do it now in particular I'd like

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,540
to speak to my fellow people of color

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:42,370
and to the ladies because we need all of

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,249
the advantages that we can get to make

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:48,490
it out there in the world so that's

00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:50,319
basically the whole point of me getting

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,980
up here just to encourage you to do the

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:56,079
things that you love and to do them out

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,990
in the open so that you're seen doing

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,490
them and that has made all the

00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:08,740
difference in my life professionally

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:10,120
thanks so much I'm recognizing a theme a

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,970
lot of people are saying just get up and

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,329
do it give back contribute participate

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,199
that's awesome if you're an extrovert

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,759
introverts might not have that

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,759
opportunity they might struggle some

00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,259
more I'm also hearing a theme that Ohio

00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,230
Linux Fest has been beneficial to a lot

00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:28,360
of people so my challenge is to

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,610
everybody introvert and extrovert give

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,160
back to a high Linux past get involved

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,679
help us help the next wave of people

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,300
coming out and into the world to figure

00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,970
out how to find a career how to find a

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,249
passion how to then help the next people

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,499
beyond of them we have to keep this

00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:46,720
going we can't be the same people the

00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:48,129
same conferences every time we've got to

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,660
get more faces involved but the only way

00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,790
we're going to do that is if we get more

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:57,209
people helping the conference so please

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:59,920
step up get involved and help us Thanks

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:06,220
hi I'm Chris and I'm terrified of public

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:08,170
speaking talk into it oh hi I'm Chris

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,500
and I'm terrified of public speaking and

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:14,410
I'm actually terrified of not public

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,820
speaking too so bear with me here but

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,860
we're working on a new Linux

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,370
distribution as originally slated to be

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:24,399
a two-year project it's probably gonna

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:27,010
be longer than that to get to alpha we

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:33,279
just need more people what we're looking

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:38,079
for are developers who are entry to mid

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,459
for C and C++ if that sounds like

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,720
something that you'd be interested in

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,490
we'd love to have you

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,320
there's some real smart people on this

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,480
team we're working with and they're real

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:53,110
nice to the the core principles for the

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,740
distribution are we're looking to go for

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,870
LSB 5 certification and FHS 3

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,040
certification if you're not sure if

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,350
those mean you'll get to learn all about

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,300
them in the project

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,699
we're on IRC and we also have a blog I

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,310
don't have a way to put that up but I

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:15,220
will if you're on slack go to the tech

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,540
live Columbus slack and go into the

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,290
Linux channel you have to have a website

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:23,230
come on then what's your website it is

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:26,380
Linux dot silo group it's s ILO group

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:29,380
dot org cool thanks so much Chris big

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,140
hand you don't have been an entire five

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:35,320
minutes so be quick about 60 seconds

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,880
this is actually not a presentation it's

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,449
a shameless plug for something

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,959
open-source

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:43,149
issue lated a project that I am not

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,529
personally involved in but it's a really

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,680
good cause that I wanted to make sure

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:50,829
everybody here is aware of and that is a

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,949
project called girls who code there is

00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:56,079
an author who has just put out a couple

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:58,329
of books I bought a copy of them I

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,350
donated them to my local Public Library

00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,690
in new condition

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,819
they're awesome this is aimed at

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,209
approximately middle-school aged female

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:09,699
students who are possibly have been

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,179
discouraged by family or society from

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,819
being

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,679
you know that well boys code girls play

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,679
with dolls and all that crap it gets

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,639
past a lot of those stereotypes and

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:25,329
makes coding an introduction to coding

00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:27,879
very fun the thing about this is whereas

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:31,509
there are a number of small projects

00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:34,419
that kind of try to make diversity and

00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:36,519
open source more of a thing this one in

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,960
the past couple of weeks has really hit

00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,059
the big time and has caught the

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,460
attention of some really large media

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,220
outlets including people like CNN and

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,769
and even Fox News has mentioned it in

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,470
passing if you have a chance go on

00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:52,149
Twitter it's at girls who code take a

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,940
look at their Twitter feeds see what

00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:57,850
they're up to and if possible we've got

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,559
a big playground here and we don't we

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,059
don't have the luxury of wasting 50

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,669
percent of the intelligence of the human

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,330
species so let's get on this guys it's a

00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:08,250
great organization thanks Scott

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,250
