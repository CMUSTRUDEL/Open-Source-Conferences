Playlist: 2017 Videos
Description: 
	This week we’ve got Susan and Vance of Ohio Linuxfest in studio to share some news about their event at the end of the month. We’ve also got our usual cast of characters with Sorg, Katie, and Chilla as we talk about the obvious things – Apple updates!
Susan and Vance are sharing this year’s Ohio Linuxfest as their Awesome Thing of the Week.
Katie is talking about what happens when you don’t realize other people can see what you like on social media.
Speaking of some things you may not realize people are seeing, check out Web Thinger for some ProTips.
Chilla is trying to share ALL OF THE Apple Event as his Awesome Thing of the Week.
Apple’s iPhone updates aren’t THAT much different – but, they’re totally different.
Now that Apple is bringing us facial recognition – how is that going to affect Snapchat?
Katie has hit her ” Get Off My Lawn” issue with iPhone.
Sorg hangs onto everything – like this first gen iPhone he just pulled out.
Katie is weighing the need to update her phone now with her desire to wait out the new iPhone.
We’ve got some thoughts about the Note 8 in comparison to the new iPhone from our in-studio guest.
Who’s looking to get an Apple Watch after today’s Apple Event?
Sorg is keen on the Apple Watch health integration from today’s Apple Event.
We’re taking a little detour through some Apple Watch discussion following today’s Apple Event.
Apple TV will be 4K thanks to the Apple Event updates.
We’re commissioning a movie night in the future with Chilla in his home of the future.
Apple Stores are not, in fact stores, but town squares.
We’re excited about the larger Apple charging mat. We’re not so excited about the need for some other things.
We just found out Chilla’s Batman utility belt contains an Apple TV.
Ever play hide-and-seek in a haunted house? Katie has! And she Facebook LIVE broadcasted it.

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,270
software and and computer development at

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,490
large so we're trying to get you know

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,830

groups to try to increase their

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,220

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,560
you know big topic these days especially

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,270
years now yeah yeah so it's a it's a

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,140
it's a community run conference so

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,450
people who are in the free and

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,640
open-source software communities you

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,920
don't necessarily have to be you know an

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,390
expert or a developer or something we

00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,240
have talks that are going to be it at

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:18,190
all levels even if you're if you're just

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,740
getting started if you're somebody who's

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,680
interested in some of the you know free

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,420
to open-source applications you don't

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,880
necessarily have to be using Linux we

00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,600
have some talks for BSD or even just

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,210
applications

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,650
you know people running Apache web

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,180
servers that kind of stuff as well it

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,760
has been going on for fifteen years

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:48,250
actually since our fifteenth year and

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:51,730
it's a grassroots free movement and it's

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:56,560
expressed through the convention it

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:59,830
started out as Ohio Linux lugs across

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,860
the state got together and started the

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,290
first Ohio Linux fest so there's a lot

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,870
of community as the community manager I

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,790
have to mention that that you get to

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,090
really know the people that are there

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,310
and even though we're from Pennsylvania

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,880
that you really get to know everybody at

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,290
a national level and at a regional level

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,930
who are involved in free and open

00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,340
software movement mmm-hmm and as we

00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,760
we've had some great discussions at

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,440
length of

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,390
Lynx feather I encourage people to check

00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,310
out an awesome chant that we did where

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,620
we really did go in-depth about about

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,800
the the organization and everything

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,330
around and why Linux is so important the

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,580
one last thing before we move on to some

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,680
what some other awesome things what's

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,390
kind of is there there there any new

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,210
developments new awesome developments

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,620
one or two in the last year in in the

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:54,760
world of Linux that we should be aware

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:56,290
of well I mean we're seeing probably

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,750
some of the topics that were that we're

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,050
gonna be seeing covered a lot of its

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,720
ground that's it's going to be pretty

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,540
familiar security talks are always very

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,790
popular we've been seeing actually for

00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,940
the past couple or three years now a

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,830
whole lot of focus on containers and

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,060
virtualization that kind of stuff has

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:23,080
has been been pretty big so yeah in

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,620
terms of of hot new technologies nothing

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,090
jumps out at me I'm what boy is kind of

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,590
more of the thing as usual this is the

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,380
kind of thing that runs underneath a lot

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,070
of stuff that we we deal with legal

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:40,360
issues and Karen Sandler would be the

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:44,640
person to discuss that she has a legal

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,890
background that I believe there's the

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,200
free software whatever what do they call

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:57,970
that licenses that's something that's

00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,910
always fluid in in motion so to keep to

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:03,030
keep up to date on that and there's so

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,800
many people that do philanthropic

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:09,670
philanthropy type projects that they're

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,350
helping underserved areas with computers

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,270
and and they're re realigning them with

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,550
Linux and free software on it and that's

00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,480
that's a wonderful thing a lot of great

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,130
options out there and it's very

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,410
accessible I think I heard Leo Laporte

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,850
say on a recent I don't know if you're

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,290
just joking around or anything with he

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,530
was just like he felt like Linux was the

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,910
easiest operating system use Ubuntu or

00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,560
something like that so it's very

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,330
accessible it's not just for developers

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,460
it's not just for I know chilla loves

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,660
his virtual machines over there for

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,410
instance and I think you run like a

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:46,180
couple of districts

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:48,370
as well don't you Oh Peter oh my I'm

00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,690
sorry yeah no I do run a lot of vm's and

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,490
I've played around with some of the

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,660
different Linux builds where where I'm

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,040
definitely using a lot of the VMS is to

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,779
build out like Chrome OS where I don't

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,800
have a Chromebook to test something or

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:05,500
build out a the Android device kind of

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,160
give me some of the the features and

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,009
ideas I'm definitely interested in UNIX

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,160
or Linux in the future from from also

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,360
from a VM perspective but that's

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,589
something I want to I want to play with

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,259
more and more but again it's very much a

00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,399
it's very much a you know something that

00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,800
there's still accessible to people as

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,949
well so go check out ohayo Linux Fest

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,810
I'm sorry ohayo Linux dot org I just

00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:34,660
wanted to mention we do have a career

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,290
track as well yes in the last couple

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:42,490
years that has been a track of itself

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,889
where several speakers in a row talked

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,519
about developing your career and IT and

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,230
an open source and the expo hall in the

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:54,009
open source solution stage is another

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:56,740
way to be in contact with potential

00:10:54,009 --> 00:11:00,009
employers and to network with the people

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,139
that could further your career as well

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:06,370
as the professional training it's

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:08,470
awesome all right let's get into some

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,579
more awesome things of the week Katie

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,670
what's your awesome thing

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:14,139
oh my awesome thing is just a heads up

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,180
in case you didn't already know this a

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:21,579
social media pro tip we can see what you

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,350
do on the internet you've been involved

00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:26,920
in a certain project recently around

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,089
this - well I guess we'll talk about

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,920
what happened first and then we'll talk

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,269
about the project because it's fun the

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,610
project is awesome what happened on the

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,779
Internet is not so much I'm sure

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,569
everybody has seen by now that Ted

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:41,680
Cruz's Twitter account like day very

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:43,930
graphic tweet so everybody was like oh

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,129
my gosh what's going on so just a heads

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,230
up if you're on Twitter and you're

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,639
liking things we can see what you're

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,170
liking as long as you have a public

00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,310
profile we can see what you're liking

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,990
you may even get a notification

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,930
that somebody you know like something

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,900
along these lines so keep that in mind

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,460
it also happens on places like LinkedIn

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,350
which has spurred a whole project that

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,250
we worked on this weekend called

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,650
webfinger

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,520
correct yes that's what we said

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,839
webfinger

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,200
mm-hmm I think that's why I made the

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,520
graphic for yes but yeah so a lot of

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,810
people think that they're out there and

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,790
doing things on social media and like

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:18,980
nobody will notice what I'm liking what

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,630
we will so this is this is twofold one

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,980
pay attention to what you're doing on

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,610
the Internet other people most likely

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,410
can see it into if you have an intern or

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,770
someone running your social media

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,500
accounts maybe just like keep an eye on

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,540
what they're doing and also maybe just

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,980
have a completely if you're someone who

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,220
has multiple accounts on their phone

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,190
there are multiple Twitter apps this is

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,310
a perfect spot for a cautionary tale

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,320
that didn't involve porn because for

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,300
some reason that we won't get into here

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,450
I have my wife's account Twitter account

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,490
on my phone and the other day I started

00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,470
getting messages like dm's and when you

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,570
see the Amazon on the iPhone it's it's

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,300
you know you don't see what account

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,430
you're under right so you I go in and

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,260
I'm like hey can you do this session on

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,089
Saturday for work and I'm like oh I'm

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,470
sorry I'm so busy but maybe I mean if

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,780
you really need me maybe I can get there

00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,500
in time with it and then like Oh Suns

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,110
icy sword go back to sleep I have this

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,660
like wait and she's like what was that I

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,250
was like oh I must have pasted something

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,960
I don't know because I still hadn't

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,630
figured it out it turns out I'm

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,900
completely using Missy's DMS thinking

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm my own account because that's how it

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,550
looks on my phone so yeah be very aware

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,040
of the accounts on your phone I've

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,510
certainly you know retweeted certain

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
things to wrong accounts I don't have a

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,890
lot of clients on my phone thankfully

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,700
because more responsible people than me

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:49,790
take care of that now but it's and

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,459
that's why but yeah no I know there's

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,560
definitely been like hey you know why

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,900
did I send this tech article to mayhem

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,430
show every once in a while or I don't

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,100
realize which I can I'm in when I'm just

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,050
liking a bunch of stuff that I'm seeing

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,459
but again it's at least like across

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,380
podcast and I could get really really

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,240
awkward if you know me

00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:13,550
your clients aren't exactly the same

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,230
kind of thing so yeah or also I mean I

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,480
would think if you're a prospective

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,030
client or someone's trying to look up

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,190
you know are the are your interests the

00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,380
same or you know do you have

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,200
commonalities in your in your work ethic

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,810
or whatnot that could definitely come

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,860
come into play as people are researching

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:36,020
each other or two to the point earlier

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,400
about LinkedIn right you know you're

00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,170
probably someone's probably gonna go

00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,340
look at someone's LinkedIn profile look

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:46,100
at you know who else they're their

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,140
LinkedIn friends with who what they're

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,270
looking at what they're posting what

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,340
they're liking I mean it can definitely

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,840
come into play and the scary thing is

00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,340
that led to this project and here's a

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,480
little bit of it for you guys you can

00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,610
check it out the sorbets Rana media

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,110
YouTube page or on Cybertron Mediacom we

have a link you know it's you people on

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,070
high-end companies don't realize how

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,510
much we can see that they're doing

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,160
especially people involved in tech

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,230
companies and you never know you could

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
have a comedian just dramatically

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,380
reading your weird comments to a Wonder

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,320
Woman

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,950
image on Instagram like late like we did

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,570
this past week so so so there's that so

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,910
let's turn into an ad for web thing or

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:32,450
thanks Katie hello what's your something

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:36,110
of the week so my thing of the week is

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:43,010
Apple's announcements iPhones iPhone you

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:47,300
can take all the announcements all the

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:50,120
iPhones all the iPhones the collection

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,300
of iPhones that are that that is out

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,410
there now oh go ahead it'll be

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,340
interesting because I'm sure this will

00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,040
turn more into a roundtable obviously if

00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:06,280
I were gonna select my the iPhone for

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:10,040
purchase I am going with the 256 gig

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,750
iPhone X Oh top-of-the-line oh look at

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,460
you I I think I'm in the same boat you

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,690
know I don't know how I'll pay for yet

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,940
but I think I'm going to be saving my

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,370
pennies for that one the interesting

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,770
thing

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,220
that and when you look at it is in my

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:27,750
might go in because I couldn't get a

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,520
strong pulse on what the physical size

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,180
of the device was so I have some friends

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,350
at work and they they actually have the

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,410
iPhone

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,660
one of them has these seven plus and

00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,720
another person I know has the six plus

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,390
and I know another person with 6s plus

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:51,180
and the telephoto lens definitely had me

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,880
convinced that I would be upgrading to

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,830
the plus line mm-hmm but what I really

00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,279
don't like about the phone is the

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:06,920
physical size well when you look at the

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:11,630
phones side-by-side the the X is about

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,630
the current size of the baseline

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:24,740
hilarious to me yeah I think it's iPhone

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:29,330
10 but yeah the 10 definitely comes in

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:33,330
physically a smidge above the current

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:39,890
the current typical iPhone 7 mm or

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:43,770
iPhone 8 so when you start to look at

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:47,340
outside of that obviously you're getting

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,520
faced ID everything has the Bionic chip

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,010
everything has wireless charging also we

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,830
call it a by a Bionic chip so you know

00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm thinking six million dollar man

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,179
every time like can my ringtone be the

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,860
60 million dollar man like like music

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,450
they're actually the theme song would be

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,550
okay but like that that's like I get a

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,170
call and it's the the I'm doing

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,309
something Bionic sound that happens

00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:13,080
there in the show but and I don't want

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:17,280
to talk by the way I love how I feel I

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,450
just know sold that completely I'm going

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,929
through all these tests and it's it's

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,730
interesting

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,170
I don't know if you have the link open I

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,700
do I'm actually feeling a bit to the

00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:26,370
page where we're going here

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,050
so as you as you go across and I'm sure

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,460
the haters are just gonna cling on to

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:34,840
this but there's no

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:38,800
that much different when it comes into

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,800
the guts as far as the camera like the

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,680
cameras for his megapixel aperture etc

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,200
when it comes in into you know what

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,000
bluetooth stuff it's using it does have

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,910
video calling audio calling all the

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,730
playback specs all of the video encoding

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:59,890
everything does 4k video recording at 24

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:02,800
30 and 60 frames per second really it

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:10,540
comes down to that new 10 form factor

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:13,000
and face ID and an emojis baby I mean

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,970
come on you get to be a talking poop

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,620
emoji you kind of win with this phone

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:23,430
right I mean that's I mean seeing Jimmy

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:27,070
Iovine as a unicorn was pretty exciting

00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,810
during the demos today but but no that's

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,480
that's like that's the big takeaway for

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,310
me for this phone is the not just like

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,080
it hey it's it's got all this power and

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,480
everything it's in okay is this giant

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,730
screen that I'll probably break but it's

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,470
it's it's the sensors and all the things

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,170
like you know there's a big

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,300
demonstration piece oh you know that and

00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,610
emojis and okay this is what they're

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,400
doing you know and you're you're rolling

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,620
in AR with this kind of stuff like what

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,480
else are they gonna be able to do what

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,310
what I'm really interested in is I'm

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,770
sure they're gonna open up a lot of that

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,480
the technology they're using pheromones

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:05,740
ease and everything I'm interested to

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:09,190
see how snapchat and Instagram and all

00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,220
of the filter apps yes then build off of

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,600
this there's a good one duck saying

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,300
that's a lot of money to be a virtual

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,450
furry know have you first of all have

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:22,150
you priced the furry suit okay I think

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,500
it's comparable so so I think we're kind

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,160
of okay with that and I don't have to

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,690
clean the thing Katie I you if any

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:34,810
you're the first person I thought of

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:35,920
when I saw animated emojis yeah you've

00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,090
looked at some of those technically

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,270
we're just talking about your your

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,190
ailing iPhone 6 as well and everything

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,140
so I mean what do you think about the

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,370
what they're packing into this thing

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,650
I here's my problem this is my get off

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,370
my lawn mowing I've officially hit the

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,840
six issue you know that I'm out a couple

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,490
versions so now everything's kind of

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,550
going to hell I don't hold a charge

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,710
anymore I can't get it not it's not

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,360
responsive anymore I can't there was

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,430
something ginormous on my phone that I

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,320
can't delete so I have no storage it's

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,090
like all the shenanigans are happening

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,790
at this point and I can't even get it to

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,320
back up onto my laptop anymore and or

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,830
transfer all my pictures to my laptops

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,440
this is very frustrating oh can you can

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,860
you up can you use your so are you on

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,950
10:33 I have not upgraded anything

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,900
because this thing will not let me up

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,270
like I have not can you get to so can

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,440
you can you get it to upgrade via your

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:37,060
laptop probably so if you get it to

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,390
upgrade view your laptop it's gonna

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,190
upgrade the file structure mm-hm and

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,890
it's gonna get rid of that big cruft

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,490
that you don't know what it is there you

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,720
go but anyways hey Katie I have a phone

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,250
over there that you can use in the

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:58,540
meantime there look at that that's a ten

00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:00,460
year old iPhone and it still works it's

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,590
not gonna work well because there is no

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,700
edge technology in cell towers anymore

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:09,070
but still that's an oversight

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,640
I like the icons they're very pretty I'm

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:14,770
large as well right and pixely in

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,930
comparison so I'm at this point where I

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:21,340
need a new phone can I make it till

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:23,320
November because I take a lot of dark

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,280
pictures when I'm in a dark haunted

00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,740
house mm-hmm

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,270
so kind of thinking the ex might solve a

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,610
lot of these photo problems too

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:35,530
or can you go get the eight and return

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:39,040
it after in 30 days or can you just get

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,660
like a 6s now or seven and then return

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,470
that when you're when it's time to get

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:48,730
the new one so what you could also do is

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:50,710
go get just the smart battery case which

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:55,090
has a bigger battery than the actual

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:57,770
phone itself so you would have the

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:03,059
original battery life

00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:05,160
your decrepit battery flus more like I

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,420
can get I can go I can go almost three

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,690
days Wow

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,460
and and since the session older phone

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:15,030
ammo fee for that it's gonna be so much

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,070
cheaper right now so you you're dropping

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,530
like 30 or 40 bucks instead of like a

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,330
hundred and twenty to get a couple extra

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,220
months out of your out of your phone I

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:30,150
just wish my camera wasn't so bad right

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:31,860
now pushing it okay so I want to get

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,240
through the camera on this too but we

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,890
were talking about face face recognition

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,510
Susan you were talking about a little

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,410
bit before before like you have face

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:44,370
recognition on your phone too don't you

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:48,240
well that pull a little closer in the

00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:51,179
past on on whatever phone I was using at

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,299
the time in it it never worked because I

00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:57,510
can look so many different ways from a

00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,669
bag lady to glamorous tit and I think a

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,940
lot of women are like that actually yeah

00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:05,780
you know but my question about the new

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:10,740
iPhone is will it give me the same

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:13,559
screen size as the note because my dream

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,190
bonus the no date if it works and

00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,410
doesn't catch on fire you know so so I'm

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:23,250
I'm kind of holding out for that but I

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:25,169
for me bigger is better and it looks

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:30,570
like size and I don't know what the

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:36,120
other one is but it looks like it looks

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:36,660
like the phone on this is sorry I just

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,120
lost it

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:50,040
it's 5 65 tall 5.8 inch display what's a

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:55,290
note show no a note 8 yeah hold on

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,030
second he's looking at that and that

00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:58,890
weird uh bit at the top with it that

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,480
seems a little odd to me but they had to

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,770
rearrange everything across the top for

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,290
that little nubbin for those can't all

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:08,130
those cameras you know all those cameras

00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:10,770
yeah that are pointed at you you know in

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,010
and I think it's mostly comparable it

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,660
looks

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,340
it's about halfway between you say this

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,290
is about halfway between like a seven

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,800
probably the eight in the a plus right

00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:23,400
Jilla yeah so that the Galaxy Note 8 is

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:27,360
six point three inches edge to edge but

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,870
don't forget they changed the width of

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,430
the device and raised the height so if

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:37,860
you if you like look at the even the

00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:39,300
Galaxy s8 they made that weird it's what

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll tell you to do is take a dollar

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:46,230
bill out of your pocket and that's like

00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,870
the the size of the phone and it's it's

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,180
weird because it's more narrow but a lot

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,860
higher so think about it if you make

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:59,550
something narrow and make it higher the

00:25:52,860 --> 00:26:00,930
actual distance goes up so it's six

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,570
point three inches I'll be interested

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:08,760
when I get the note eight to see how it

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:12,870
actually feels in comparison so that to

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:17,820
the ten but the old note I thought was a

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:21,030
hole I had the notes six or five because

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,760
they skipped six I had the note 5 and I

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,560
thought it was a little bit large I got

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,320
a little more used to it as I started to

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,570
use the s-pen more but going even larger

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,040
than that I kind of wonder but then

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,140
again you also get more usually more

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,000
battery life out of that so mm-hmm

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,660
there's always give-and-take to the size

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,300
depends on how big your pockets are how

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:49,110
are your pockets too bad more men don't

00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:50,700
have purses hey you know fanny packs

00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:58,650
were making a comeback as one of our

00:26:50,700 --> 00:27:02,490
guests your your smartphone in your back

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,650
in your back pocket hmm but getting your

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,080
phone into a purse isn't is a nice thing

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,790
because you're mmm away from that you

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,410
know you're gonna walk around with an

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:15,420
iPad if you needed to and some do so

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,920
we'll talk a little bit about I want

00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,600
talk a little bit more Apple

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,000
the enthusiasts registration

pre-registration is free F REE and like

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,420
where can you get so much value for free

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:39,809
you know in a free software you know and

00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:44,010
and and Linux operating system

00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:48,559
convention so so best best opportunity

00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:51,000
around to come out for it absolutely so

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,190
on the end Apple announcements

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,800
the other big thing I think today was

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,270
the okay what's my new watch gonna be

00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,640
when this pebble stops working in a

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,750
couple weeks and chill I know you're

00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,900
probably keeping a good eye on this

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:10,080
Apple watch so I'm personally not that

00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:13,460
interested in the LTE alright then Katie

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,460
what do you think about the Apple watch

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,840
so so I'm actually so I still run in the

00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,140
series one mmm-hmm so if you hold out

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,580
for for a couple months if that if that

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,590
pebble can make it a couple more months

00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,010
you may be able to find a barter deal

00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,140
again oh no way this is gonna be like

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,940
when I'm so so wait wait what do I have

00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,730
the trade you I had a Google glass and

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,290
you gave me a pebble and an iPad so I

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,059
don't know what I have to offer you I

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,160
don't know what that wolf to figure it

00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:46,460
out because I'm actually interested in

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,100
the series 3 4 because it would be a

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,710
large upgrade from my series 1 mm-hmm

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:56,309
but I probably wouldn't go to the extent

00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,410
of getting the LTE model I would

00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,460
definitely I'm definitely planning on

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,690
getting the typical 42 millimeter

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,600
explain for anybody that didn't get the

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,880
the you know the early announcements for

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,710
today so so there's gonna be an LT is it

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,190
LT is its cellular I don't know if they

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,840
even said LTE in this one but it so the

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,940
idea is you can walk out of your house

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,340
you're jogging you your and your your

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,200
watch still has connection and you can

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,110
use you know you can get texts you can

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,460
make phone calls I think and everything

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,780
I don't know there was a demo where he

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,820
called his daughter and she was out in

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,000
the middle of a lake paddle boarding so

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:36,090
and sorry they're wet chillers camera

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:44,010
Sheila take a nice look at the corner of

00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:47,730
the room for the rest of the show I put

00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:55,200
you in the corner I have this really

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:59,220
cheap Smart Watch phone from China what

00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,260
is that it's a webpage that you you bid

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,000
on different things and it starts really

00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,020
low so you get like a SmartWatch for

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,330
like 4 bucks maybe 10 bucks and it's a

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:15,270
Bluetooth telephone calling so you have

00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:17,760
to have your smartphone in range for

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,980
your watch to work as a phone but then

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,960
you could just use your your phone you

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,080
wouldn't need to use the phone on the

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,120
watch if you have to have the your

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,640
telephone within Bluetooth right right

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,650
right but you know so well they said I

00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,900
think the idea is you go jogging you go

00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:37,169
surfing they are showing right things

00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,150
like that so that was the major

00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,980
complaint between the series 1 in the

00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:44,640
series 2 is that you couldn't leave your

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:49,130
phone behind and still GPS track your

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,290
your your runs and that's a series 2

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:54,480
integrated the GPS directly into

00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:57,270
the watch then the big complaint was

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,800
okay now I can't take or make a phone

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:03,390
call or a text message or whatever if I

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,760
need to be able to be reached without my

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,320
phone I could still do the GPS tracking

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,330
but I couldn't I couldn't without my

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,230
phone and I think it's a life assessment

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,790
isn't it cuz that's the way I was

00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,230
looking I was like am i a person that is

00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,400
going to leave my phone behind am i

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,810
person that goes jogging

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,710
where do I go jogging if I had this

00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,910
watch you know and not have to - thank

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,840
you for that no one puts chill in the

00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:27,330
corner suite you know you know it on

00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,830
tethers you from that right so so you

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:31,560
don't have to carry that on you because

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,270
again what if you have an iPhone plus or

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,650
something right and you want to go

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:36,690
jogging and have it then you're you know

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:41,210
in your pocket it's kind of you know

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:43,560
yeah from the chat room Amanda who

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,230
Juliet to disclaim who she works for

00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,110
in this technically this will be the

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,010
first washi box is that flat or digital

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,020
wash you saying

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,340
probably flat I don't think I've ever

00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,360
seen her with a watch that I'm aware of

00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,830
so so there's that I mean it is enough

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,800
going on with it it's got all the health

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,960
things I was really impressed with the

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,670
heart monitor like it that warned you

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,840
like see if I'm just sitting here and

00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm obviously doing not doing any

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,940
physical activity which is unfortunately

00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,950
more often than it probably should be

00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,750
and my heart rate goes up it'll give me

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,280
a notification because it's like

00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,870
obviously something is up right whether

00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,450
it be your stress level or something is

00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,820
tipping you off and eventually you know

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,260
that's something that and there was some

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,510
some things they were working on with

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,230
Stanford where you know that information

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:34,680
can be collected and used and and you

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:37,500
know identify heart problems you know

00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,540
way before they become our problem so I

00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,430
think that's really cool and having that

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,680
attached you it's pretty good I know how

00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:47,460
we're with this cuz the peple to the the

00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,200
very limited edition pebble - I love it

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,150
because now I have a sleep monitor with

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,160
it and I know how much sleep I got and I

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,320
can keep track of that plus the steps

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,630
plus the heart rate and look Mac you

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,220
know because I've had that where I'm

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,630
just like kind of like I feel like like

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,280
I feel kind of worked up right now I

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,470
look I was like wow yeah my heart

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,760
monitor is higher and you can go in you

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,210
see all that data you can see where the

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,560
spikes are

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,660
and everything like that and I could go

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,820
to a doctor and be like you know do I

00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,740
have a problem here I think that opens

00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,060
up a lot of really interesting new

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,150
applications that can hopefully help

00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,270
people so I'm interested to see how

00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:23,820
quickly Spotify comes out with a

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,930
full-fledged watch app now because

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,210
because they you don't do anything

00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:30,030
person you can do controls from the

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,430
watch but it doesn't it's still

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,490
streaming and kind of relying on some

00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:39,990
key pieces back on the phone now with

00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,340
this theory you don't need and that was

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,710
one of the big things that they they

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,160
talked about today was you know Apple

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,530
music rate tell it to play something and

00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,240
it's just gonna stream it over the

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,090
network without your phone there so

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,000
right I'm interested to see how I wonder

00:34:54,090 --> 00:35:00,170
if this is also a way for to push some

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,890
developers to build the more robust

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:08,010
applications for the watch I use Siri

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:14,640
quite often from the watch to control

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:17,160
homekit type stuff I often send text

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,250
short text messages back from the watch

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,350
so I am becoming more and more into

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,760
using the watch what will it replace my

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:27,660
phone totally until we can get to the

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,910
the Avengers

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,650
you know Tony Stark I can I can pinch

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,180
and zoom out and have like a 3d hologram

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,000
in front of it it's probably not gonna

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,960
replace my phone but I'm starting to

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,410
rely more and more on actions on the

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,510
watch than even going back to my phone

00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,940
and perfect example of life style kind

00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:50,070
of making a decision for this Amanda who

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,720
kind of this actually fits in our

00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,370
earlier conversation she was using she's

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,890
using Steve's account in here to talk

00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,690
with us

00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,460
but he said she says she could get a

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,960
cellular because she leaves her phone at

00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,970
her desk too much and she runs around

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,490
the mall in the store and misses so many

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,510
texts from her bosses so there you go if

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,980
you're and again you know women usually

00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,870
have it in the purse not in you know

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,330
pockets right so that's gonna happen

00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:17,670
more often yeah yeah Missy producer

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,870
Missy yeah I had this conversation with

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,380
you today when you were talking with me

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,490
about it

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,800
we were watching

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,510
event my thing is that if I want to go

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,369
out for a jog I don't want to have to

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,930
take everything with me so in order to

00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,119
take my phone I either have to have

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,410
something that has pockets or I have to

00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,450
have one of those little sleeve things

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:37,340
for my arm or I need to have some other

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:40,980
man some other way of carrying my phone

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:46,710
nobody's on it gets sweaty buddy likes a

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:50,040
sweaty iPhone exactly like it those the

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:56,010
waterproof apply the iPhone boob sweat

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:58,350
I don't know Apple technician in out

00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,119
there in the exact cupboard on Apple

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:08,580
care

00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:11,850
I'm guessing it's covered I would love

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:14,100
the opportunity to go out to the gym or

00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,240
you know for a run in the morning or

00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,130
something like that without having to

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,510
worry about taking my phone with me but

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,170
still having the accessibility that I

00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:27,030
had my music with me as well as an way

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:30,240
to call if I needed to to reach help

00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:33,630
mm-hmm don't you need a SIM card and

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,520
service with so here's found here's the

00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,380
interesting thing so one the SIM card it

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,240
they have a what they call it a digital

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,140
sim that they have built into the phone

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,220
I believe and also and actually Amanda

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,859
I'm pretty sure we're still playing

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,510
Amanda here it's bringing up they said

00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,520
in the can do that carriers could have

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,080
deals coming up so she's hoping that

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,490
they would have some bundle deals like

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,530
she can get the phone in the watch for

00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:58,200
an extra 75 months so because the the

00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:01,890
the watch despite not having your phone

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,869
there can be on the same phone number so

00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,190
it's not like another device like when

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:07,320
you put your iPad out it gets its own

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,180
phone number right like somehow they're

00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,240
arranged this so you will be sharing

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,800
that same phone number as you don't and

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,359
it's interesting how all the

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,140
technologies have led up to this because

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:23,010
you remember a while back where I know

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:25,109
AT&T and Verizon announced that you

00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,450
could merge phone numbers down to a

00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:30,900
single device and then you could use

00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:33,030
like the Samsung has their their gear

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,490
device that's a watch with cellular

00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,380
embedded

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:41,080
then what was the other one

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,910
then the iPad came that the newer iPads

00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,119
came out and they don't have SIM card

00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,619
slots in them the cellular ones they

00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,420
don't have some card slots in them there

00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,550
are they were already using the digital

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,710
sim is this brand-new because the iPad

00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:56,920
pro we just switched on to AT&T and it

00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,690
we received it as a Verizon model and we

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,760
just swapped the Sims like they strike

00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,220
yeah the newer I think the newer iPads

00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,530
not the not the last pro not not the

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,440
first pro but there's ones that have the

00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,790
digital sim and when you literally

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,650
active when you activate them if you

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,500
bought them direct from Verizon you pick

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,060
which service you won this is another

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,420
updating from our inside source over

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,160
here saying they'll act like a separate

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,580
line that will they won't assign a

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,410
number or a number that would link to

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,680
the other haven't talked to her AT&T you

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:32,619
got yet she's got a guy to figure this

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,849
out so we'll get updates on that now

00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:35,800
hopefully we'll update that it's a good

00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,900
good time to mention join our awesome

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,609
cast Facebook group where all these

00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,830
discussions happen and we kind of sort

00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:43,980
out these or or slack but let's keep

00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,839
them in the facebook group but anyways

00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,030
anything else okay so we're gonna watch

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,970
crazy of course but Apple TV was

00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:53,650
announced their 4k which you know I

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,599
don't know how many of us have 4k TVs

00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:00,310
anybody in the room probably Chula right

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,440
I have a 4k display I my large TV hasn't

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:08,080
been upgrading primarily waiting for

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:11,200
this device of course of course because

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,119
is that because now chilla with the 4k

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,310
Apple TV which I think starts at only

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:22,000
about thirty dollars more than the other

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:24,820
Apple TV like 160 170 bucks a bad

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,640
considering anything that you bought on

00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:29,290
iTunes is gonna be upgraded that I guess

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,660
is available is gonna be automatically

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:35,109
upgraded to 4k 4k movies are the same

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,330
price as HD yeah and I'm I'm there's

00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:39,810
there was a lot of hoopla about this

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:43,570
over the last couple weeks about how

00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:46,270
Apple was really holding out to to get

00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,810
that pricing to be matched and I'm super

00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,830
excited that my entire I

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:52,760
toons library is now upgraded for free

00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,500
because that will actually make a

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,390
difference when I'm watching in my

00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,420
office because that's where I have my 4k

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,120
display and most even when you think

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,010
about four it's one thing to say do you

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,990
have any 4k devices it's another thing

00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,530
how many devices do you have that are

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:12,770
over 1080p which the majority of my

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:17,180
devices are over 1080p they're the they

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:21,200
called ultra high def so that's where

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm excited for that switchover as well

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,630
as bringing the faster processor to the

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,010
Apple TV and and that kind of thing I'm

00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:33,500
not overly crazed about the the new

00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,180
controller killa we all come over to

00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,150
your place and watch Star Wars in 4k

00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,920
please okay we'll just have a movie

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,270
night and we'll watch for that inside I

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,290
can't I want to see the new spider-man

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:51,710
it's true too but every Star Wars come

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:53,090
on three 3d 4k ultra or what is an HDR

00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,460
that's four that's where it's gonna be

00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,900
yeah where's the three I need to get at

00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,070
least the 3d because I was looking

00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,630
through my blu-rays because I just get

00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,190
the blu-rays again with just to have a

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,380
digital copy and that's actually how I

00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:04,730
watch it I lived in Italy just like two

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,680
weeks ago got my blu-ray player because

00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,690
I got an Xbox one finally so I can

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,370
actually pop some of those in then it

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,130
don't get the features on the digital

00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:16,730
but anyways I'm just like I have a lot

00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,890
of 3d I should get a 3d TV right those

00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:22,130
are cheap now but apparently I need to

00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:24,890
get a 4k crazy I don't even know kind of

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,240
thing but we'll see so chill it let us

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:30,530
know how about 4k goes and we'll have

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,060
our house party with you so I mean I

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:36,440
can't choose the internet you gotta get

00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:39,070
so anyways um anything else Apple today

00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,330
that we missed their stores are pretty

00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,890
that's when I learned it they're not

00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:48,560
they're not stores they're not store

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:52,240
account squares it town squares that's a

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:56,540
wonderful place is the loiter apparently

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,620
they have some new beats I was surprised

00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,720
they're actually coming out with a pair

00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,490
of beats that are lightning only on the

00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:06,329
on the the connector

00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:08,190
I'm what I'm a super excited about and

00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:10,559
it's one of the reasons that I'm also

00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,829
gonna replace my watch and have to buy a

00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:19,799
new case for my iPods or my air pods is

00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:21,720
uh the charging mat so okay I'm super

00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:23,190
excited about that charging mat I'll uh

00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,599
okay good because when they they

00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:27,539
announced there's a certain point where

00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:29,700
like we we figured something out you

00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,109
know as they get thankfully it was not

00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,660
there one more thing they did one more

00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,160
thing the iPhone iPhone 10 which was

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,839
nice and they talked about how much they

00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,549
respect that term the the charging man

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,710
they're like oh you got your phone you

00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:45,750
got your watch you got your air pods

00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,180
right that all need a lightning

00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,119
connector to charge should like well

00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,859
here's here's a wireless mat that's just

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,390
big enough for all three of your things

00:43:52,859 --> 00:44:01,109
and just like wow thanks guys thanks for

00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:03,270
thinking of that guys like they say

00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:05,609
there was something some technology and

00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,890
technologies don't let you do this is

00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:09,240
that right chilla for that I don't know

00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:12,450
so they're the nice thing that I do like

00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,260
is all of these devices are using that

00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:20,069
she's standard or yeah I pronounce it G

00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:22,140
the Qi interestingly enough to your

00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:24,690
point so I have multiple devices that

00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:28,700
use that standard but no one's power mat

00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:30,990
is big enough to charge more than one so

00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,970
I'm interested to see how many of these

00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:35,400
companies start to really put out more

00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:38,460
to create a bigger charging that like

00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,900
Apple has because they're not with a

00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,210
brand that I would trust and I actually

00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,160
get like the Samsung charger and I've

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,859
had some generic ones that break after

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,829
ten minutes of use or heat up and feel

00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:53,970
like it's a fallen meteorite cooking in

00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:56,970
your hand so I'm a little hesitant to

00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:00,859
just throw thousand-dollar technology

00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:03,510
devices down on just anyone's power mat

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:05,910
but I'm excited for the size of this one

00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,910
because like I said I have here's here's

00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,799
one size the one from Samsung okay you

00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,869
think about it it looks like have a

00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:14,760
Amazon echo sized for those of you guys

00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:18,390
on audio I can put my

00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,040
phone on it rate but now I can't put any

00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,410
other devices on it so if I wanted to

00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,790
put this phone on and I can't I can't

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,100
stay it doesn't let me stack them and

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,890
stack it unstackable phone charging

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,200
that's low so that's where that's where

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,880
I'm excited for this device and I'll be

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,750
interested to see how many people that

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,830
have non-apple devices pick up this

00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:42,450
charging map because of its size mm-hmm

00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,860
I am a little bummed that I have to buy

00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,860
a new case for my air pods

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,090
only be another 30 or 40 dollars I'm

00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,970
sure Thank You private

00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:58,470
here $40 here hundred dollars for the

00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:02,250
man we're looking for

00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,750
III MacBook options for Missy and so she

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,660
keep stops getting stuck with Windows

00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,920
updates and and we're just like oh by

00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,330
the way this is the world that you need

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,630
to walk into and I just showed her all

00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:15,000
the dongle she was gonna need USB C and

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:20,370
it is like wonderful welcome to dango

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,590
dango world so yeah just make everything

00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,810
Wireless III did conveniently get a nice

00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:28,290
dongle bag from word camp this past year

00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:31,560
there yeah they knew they knew they know

00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:35,610
the dongles at WordCamp so there was an

00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,810
interesting so so the dongles that

00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,270
you're looking at are they mainly for

00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,130
video oh no no no just the just so she

00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,920
can plug in her extra monitor and ever

00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:46,710
and ever in and mouse and everything

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,540
that she uses at her desk so it's it was

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,000
interesting because I was talking to

00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,970
someone from from the the Fruit Company

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,500
and they they showed me their their

00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,780
backpack and they're like I don't

00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,820
understand guy actually said I don't

00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,260
understand why anyone needs dongle I'm

00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,840
like well you know if you want to plug

00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,610
into this for that or or whatever and he

00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,820
opened up his backpack and it was a

00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:14,670
relatively very small very late lap or

00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:18,510
laptop bag and in the center of the

00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:20,670
backpack was an actual Apple TV and then

00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,620
around the backpack was like a bluetooth

00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:24,030
mouse it wasn't apple's bluetooth mouse

00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,460
but it was a bluetooth mouse that he

00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,390
preferred and like everything was around

00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:31,180
the Apple TV very nice nice

00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,680
to meet and he was pretty much like just

00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,170
make everything Wireless

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,059
mm-hm and I'm like that may work for you

00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:41,890
and the more and more I thought about it

00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:44,200
I actually now carry an Apple TV with me

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:47,109
because it allows me to project any of

00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,190
my devices to anyway I'm just carry an

00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:53,829
Apple TV with you as a utility yep

00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:57,760
because I can now airplay anything to

00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,900
anything wow that's a good so you're

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,309
you're really pushed because I've been

00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,809
trying I have a chromecast in here and

00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm just like you guys have an Apple TV

00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:10,420
in here and now what I did was I found

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,980
an old used the fourth the fourth gen so

00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,450
where did the one where you can't add

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,240
your own apps right like that's all you

00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:19,510
need which is like that's later it's

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,799
lighter it's thinner it's cheaper way

00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:24,430
way way you sound like an Apple Keynote

00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:27,069
now Katie what have you learned about

00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:32,049
Apple from today they're make me wait

00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:34,299
till November it has been the topic of

00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:40,960
the day what do you guys guys or

00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:43,960
anything from Apple today no I'm still a

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,500
dedicated Android user mmm my

00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:51,430
understanding is androids built on a

00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:53,680
Linux operating system so I avoid Apple

00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,619
at all cost and if you want to avoid

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,859
Microsoft updates the solution is to

00:48:56,619 --> 00:49:02,200
have Linux is your operating system on

00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:04,210
your on your obviously tested that

00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,970
multiple times yeah oh my god just need

00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,640
a bun - you'll be all right

00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:12,519
and then we say yeah but Photoshop yeah

00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,490
yeah one thing I wanted to say about the

00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:17,289
smartphone is fitbit's coming up with

00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:20,619
some really nice features on their

00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:23,319
Fitbit so the one I'm looking at has a

00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,720
date they'll tell me what date it is as

00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:28,210
well as the time as well as all those

00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,539
other things with sleep and running and

00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:33,940
things like that so to me a hundred and

00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:36,759
twenty nine dollars on sale is a lot

00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:40,089
better than the you know Apple watch or

00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:42,370
whatever you know they have out there so

00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:44,710

fun last week I do want to mention I

00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,880
presume that you did this there's the

00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:21,420
Facebook live that was the hide-and-seek

00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,420
that was so that was an awesome concept

00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,210
that was actually Scott that walked

00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,440
downstairs and did that involved the

00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:29,350
clown around mm-hmm

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,910
because he wanted to do which is i sat

00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,850
and watched I was ready for anything in

00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,680
the laptop I was like because you guys

00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,730
just you you went down there and you

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,770
heard like the laughing in the

00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,000
background and it's dark and it's creepy

00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,790
and it's like two minutes and they just

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,600
did it on Facebook live and and and

00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:49,780
spoiler the clown finds me so we didn't

00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,640
know I was gonna go but no it was it was

00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,440
a really cool concept and like this so

00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,450
it was just you just walk down there

00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,000
with a phone and did it right so I mean

00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,380
just the

00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,210
the little things are the ones that

00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,280
sometimes matter the most as we

00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:04,580
discussed many times on this and other

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,200
