myself look good get started then

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,109
my name is ten more I'm an employee of

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,750
IX systems and I work and one of the

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,170
core developers or the true s project I

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,820
am also the well the man behind the

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,100
curtain so to speak of the Lumina

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,930
desktop it was my baby I did it in the

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,910
evenings I started working on it and

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,140
during the day at work hours at AI

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,610
existence because I said hey this is

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,530
cool we're gonna need this for true us

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,180
eventually so I got to work in it all

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,230
the time once I proved that hey this is

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,110
actually something that's going to turn

00:00:49,230 --> 00:01:01,980
out really cool so yes you can blame me

00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:05,189
for everything associated with this ok

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,840
so there's just a few key questions I

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,299
want to talk about it's probably things

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,570
that you've may have come to mind when

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,070
you were using a desktop may not have

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,680
but these are kind of the underlying

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,000
things that go into how it does top

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,590
works and we're gonna try and address

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,380
these and just formalize them and say

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,600
okay what is this so first off what is a

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,040
desktop seems like everybody I talk to

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,619
at these conferences has a different

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,700
definition of what a desktop is so let's

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,799
just set the groundwork we'll try and

00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,570
does not business Dartmouth all right

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,460
and then we'll go into alright how is it

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,530
desktop assembled and then how does that

00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,799
transition for all the various desktops

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,000
that you're know and love from Linux how

00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,920
does the desktop integrate with the

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,079
operating system that's also one of the

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,299
big key features is ok that affects

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,750
portability that affects all the other

00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:55,539
stuff or what can I do and then how is

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,000
lumina to any different so aluminum one

00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:01,030
is out and available right now we're on

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,429
version 1.3 0.3 which is the development

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,799
version the latest release version the

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:09,160
public version for all the operating

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,079
systems is one point 3.0 the extra dot

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,430
is what I use for development changes as

00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,690
I'm working on stuffs like oh this is

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,430
significant change let's just both the

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,329
development tag that way we can keep

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,040
track of what version people are on so

00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:22,780
let's go through what a desktop is here

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,180
is what you see are like the three

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,110
common answers that I get to the

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,209
question what is a desktop first people

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,069
say well it's everything it's a complete

00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,530
graphical system with a collection of

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,319
various utilities for common tasks for

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,690
example they point to KDE or no more

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,069
sometimes even xfce you install that

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,389
desktop you got everything you don't

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,880
need to install anything else you've got

00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:47,950
an office suite you've got an email

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,069
client you've got a web browser you've

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,660
got text editors and you know multimedia

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,590
or application you know the whole kit

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,989
and kaboodle it comes with everything

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,389
that's a desktop and then you have

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,069
people to say no not all of that is the

00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,889
desktop the desktop is only the

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,329
interface it's only what would in KDE

00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:06,940
land they now call plasma

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,760
that's the desktop not the applications

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,530
just the workspace itself so that's what

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,019
gives you the application shortcuts it

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,989
manages the windows and that would be

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:20,590
something like cady's plasma or alumina

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:22,510
1 & 2 or just you know for those of you

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,359
that are doing yourselfers take

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,579
something like open box or i 3wm or

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:30,130
something and then add a doc to it with

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,380
some other application so something like

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,450
cairo doc or you know mix it with

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,099
something else or i3 doc so that you

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,349
build your own and a lot of people would

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,120
say that's the desktop but then you have

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:41,519
people there

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,930
and say no you only need window

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,750
management that's the only thing you

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,580
need to define a desktop and so somebody

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,220
with like that would say oh just running

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,840
fluxbox is a desktop just running open

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,870
box or just running the nitramene WM

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,420
that's a desktop so you have a large

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,819
range of things that are considered to

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,640
be included in the desktop depending on

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,549
who you actually talk to so I would

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,470
propose this for the definition of what

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,950
a desktop is because I think it really

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,920
cuts to the meat of the issue a desktop

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,979
is a graphical interface to an operating

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,079
system which supports industry standards

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,019
for application interactions and

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,600
controls there are a whole host of free

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,639
standards the free desktop group publish

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,850
what are often referred to as the xdg

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,340
standards so that things like star dot

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,190
desktop files that's a very specific

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,930
standardized format it's a text format

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,490
but it's a file that tells you oh this

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,190
is how to launch an application this is

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,020
what icon it uses this is the tooltip

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,870
and extra from it gives you standards

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,120
for all of that information so where

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,560
this ends up breaking down is I have

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,050
some examples here of a couple the other

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,930
standards bodies for window management

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,970
itself you have the icy CCM and extended

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,330
window manager hence I can't remember

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,260
what the icy CCM expansion is is just

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,610
now girifna is just a collection of

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,440
letters to me but yeah that's one of the

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,410
older standards than the ewm age is the

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,639
newer standards the xdg desktop menu and

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,050
entry specs that's some of the newer

00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,970
specs by the free desktop group

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,400
specifically involving dot desktop files

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,050
and thanks there's a whole set of other

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,580
specs from the free desktop group as

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,060
well specifically regarding things like

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,099
painting cursor themes icons color

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,270
schemes all sorts of things like that

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,860
that starts getting a little bit

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,440
debatable as to whether or not their

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,940
official specs or just guidelines I mean

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,550
even in the free desktop group will say

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,389
that so you start running into a little

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,590
bit there but with this definition what

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,510
they see is you start seeing the

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,760
breakdown of all stuff

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,740
you would say that okay ke E is a

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,390
desktop that in Nome is a desktop that's

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,150
kind of what you expect they build

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:54,230
themselves as desktop environments but

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,300
then something like lxq to LXDE yeah

00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,580
those would still be desktops too even

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,470
if they don't give you their own self

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,720
built web browser or they don't give you

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,100
their own self built you know whatever

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,820
application because that's not

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,760
technically part of the app the desktop

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,830
by the same token a lot of the window

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,100
managers would not fall under this desk

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,480
this definition something like open box

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,980
for instance because it's just providing

00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,530
the basic canvas

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,990
it doesn't necessarily do all the

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,400
standards compliance so it starts to

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,960
provide that little bit of distinction

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,760
there it's like okay what can it do

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,590
doesn't adhere to common standards or is

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,400
it just doing the bare minimum to put

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,050
visuals on the screen so I like to use

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,790
this for the definition of a desktop and

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,650
this is kind of what I'm gonna go into

00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,360
so when I say desktop later on in the

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,810
talk this is kind of what I'm referring

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,310
to

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,930
okay so let's go into how a desktop is

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,030
assembled you've probably seen bits and

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,730
pieces of this especially if you run top

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,500
or if you run a bunch of other profiling

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,870
system is on your desktop systems you'll

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,210
see something like this so I've kind of

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,470
categorized them as they were added to

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,020
what's called the desktop environment

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,580
over time originally when they first

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,800
started with this what I would call

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,960
desktops originally you just had x11 it

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,760
was designed to start X to run one

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,680
application and that was it so that's

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,240
pretty much all you have and then

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,980
they're like oh well we want to run more

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,590
than one application now so now we need

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,180
to run X to start something else called

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,510
it window manager to let you run

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,830
multiple applications in Windows and

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,240
then it's like okay well now if you've

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,280
got that now you have to worry about the

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,810
wallpapers or icons underneath the

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,190
windows and start based you can see how

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,810
they desktop started getting a

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm old and built up over time from

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,930
there so they added wallpapers they

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,880
added reserved screen area it's called

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,140
panels or sometimes they call them

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,420
toolbars or this is different

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,770
terminology for this and then they said

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,730
oh well now we got to start worrying

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,590
about what if you want to lock your

00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,180
session what if you want to do screen

00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,100
savers for some of those old monitors

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,530
they had to add those as extra

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,780
components footboard

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,240
global clipboards global keychains for

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,460
things like SSH keys and stuff like that

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,850
later on it's like okay now we need that

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,020
for wised application launcher system

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,340
because it's getting so big we now need

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,020
a formalized way of launching

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,190
applications so that everything is

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,330
launched the same way instead of

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,910
expecting everyone to do it from the

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,710
command line manually and then oh well

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,320
it's gotten so big now we need a session

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,670
manager now we need to write a utility

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,370
to manage all the other utilities that

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,780
we wrote for your session and then you

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,220
can see that they started adding all

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,500
sorts of other stuff so now it's pretty

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,540
much common practice that a desktop also

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,040
includes a file manager if you look at

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,300
most of the common file managers out

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,950
there right now almost all of them are

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,690
associated with desktop projects you

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,190
still find a few on the side that aren't

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,400
associated with any desktop but they're

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,919
getting rarer and rarer service manager

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,450
device manager network manager file

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,160
sharing manager you start seeing that

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,110
especially when it comes to the building

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,850
and file managers like ocular and stuff

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,710
it's like oh that manages your file

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,520
sharing now that manages the connections

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,230
to samba or NFS or whatever and even

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,910
package manager you starting to see some

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,770
wrongness of that now with the desktops

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,480
getting involved in what how to install

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,100
packages and how to actually deal with

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,200
what applications are installed on the

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,050
system so you can kind of see there's

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,390
this trend of how the desktop is kind of

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,610
built up over time and how more and more

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,940
and more stuff keeps getting lewd onto

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,200
it

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,810
if you start trying to categorize this

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,720
you start to see a little bit because

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,060
initially is focus just on the graphical

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,920
session you see okay I'm just dealing

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,980
with the windows I'm just dealing with

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,680
the wallpaper I'm just dealing with

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,940
the screen itself after that they

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,440
started dealing with oh wait a minute

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,750
now we're writing things that you might

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,970
not see they're running but they're

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,880
designed for applications to cook into

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,920
so the global clipboard the keychain

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,260
manager now the applications don't need

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,940
to do those themselves now they are you

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,830
hooking into something that's already

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,200
running on the system which is provided

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,580
by the desktop same with the session

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,170
manager and things like that those are

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,540
ways of managing all these applications

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,060
they started adding stuff for the

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,440
applications and then this last phase

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,990
you can see they're really starting to

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,780
go gangbuster on trying to do things for

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,820
the operating system so now you use the

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,940
desktop to control the operating system

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,860
and tell us what to do so now it's like

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,320
oh now we're starting all these services

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,940
you go through us to kill services you

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,900
go through new this you can obviously do

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,420
it from the command line but you're

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,490
starting to see a lot of creep from the

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,610
desktop itself as to note we're starting

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:27,610
to manage some of this so you can start

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,560
to see these trends being a question

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,560
that comes to mind then especially with

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,960
this last phase all right this is just a

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,720
desktop we're talking about where is the

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,520
operating system where does the desktop

00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,950
end and the operating system again

00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,130
there's starting to be a lot of bleed

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,510
over a lot of you know common areas that

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:51,490
both of them are fighting for control

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:53,500
over so this leads directly into the

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,090
next question and by the way let me just

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,770
tell you right here if you have

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,280
questions on any slides please raise

00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,830
your hand

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,890
I love stopping and talking about this

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,320
so we'll go on anybody has any questions

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,000
about that

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,860
okay all right so let's listen to the

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,570
next question so how does the desktop

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,670
integrate with the operating system

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,850
where you start to see those boundaries

00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,980
and those borders so if you look at the

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,960
traditional operating system this is

00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,260
tends to be your command line only your

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,880
server based operating system the

00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,670
operating system provides a system

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,130
console a terminal usually it tends to

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,160
be keyword only but the operating system

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,110
manages

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,590
users and groups are available how you

00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,690
actually login to the system and manages

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,760
networking devices and how that's

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,520
actually done in packets are sent it

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,890
manages services because services tend

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,660
to be non graphical so the operating

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,120
system itself is usually responsible for

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,250
anything graphical and it has its own

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,960
service manager it could be open RC it

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:57,440
could be now system D it could be you

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,420
know all sorts of stuff for that the

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,640
file system itself the desktop again is

00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,020
generally spaced graphical side of

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,790
things so the operating system is what

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,620
manages the file system the operating

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,810
systems with sets o what thing do you

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,180
need here same with your shelves because

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,490
that's your command-line interface your

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,870
command line representation of the

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,270
operating system tends to be your

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,620
shelves or your terminal similarly the

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,580
hardware drivers and they provide some

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,110
standard libraries usually C libraries

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,790
if you go to some of the other operating

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,950
systems like Windows you see they even

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,660
they provide standard libraries but they

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,280
might not be C they might be like

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,470
c-sharp or something in that case for

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,750
Windows and with Apple they have their

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,860
special what's it I came here as an

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,020
objective-c libraries so again so that's

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,820
kind of in the realm of the operating

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,970
system everything that's basically non

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,890
visual it run that you can run directly

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,990
without any ex involved without any

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,880
graphics drivers without even a graphics

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,710
card installed pretty much anything

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,080
there that usually falls under the realm

00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,330
of the operating system the desktop

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,970
provides the quote unquote graphical

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,880
console it's kind of like how the

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,370
terminal is the text representation of

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,990
the operating system the desktop is the

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,900
graphical representation of the

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,240
operating system so the keyboard is

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,730
optional it tends to be more flexible

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,100
with regards to inputs for users so you

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,680
can use a mouse you can use touch pads

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,360
you can use keywords you can use you

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,340
know whatever you want there's all sorts

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,960
of devices that you can use most of

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,180
those all fall under the realm of the

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,570
desktop because they allow for a larger

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,580
variety of input from the user

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,320
it still tends to be multiple user as

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,610
well it's like okay you have a multiple

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
sessions at the same time but then they

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,520
ask the operating system hey can this

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,380
user login multiple application it's run

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,940
it's designed to run multiple things and

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,310
show all of them at the same time

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,350
whereas a standard console is designed

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,970
to show one thing at a time unless you

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,740
run it through some other application

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,240
like screen that lets you run you know

00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,320
multiple things concurrently and then

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,860
you can switch around back and forth

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,540
between them and then they also provide

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,820
standard libraries and stuff either the

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:09,380
x11 or the Wayland libraries they also

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:12,380
tend to be C libraries so there is a lot

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,660
of analogies between the non desktop the

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,980
operating system and the desktop system

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,420
they do a lot of the same things but

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,500
they're designed and focused on

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,940
different ways so they have just

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,490
different ways of approaching the same

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:28,240
problem so let's keep going at this how

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,530
does it tie into the operating system

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,900
again looking at the trend you starting

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:36,050
to see a lot more OS intrusion by the

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,660
desktops file system interference how

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,950
many of you run known how many of you

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,570
realize you're running your own virtual

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:47,600
file system just for don't call it gvfs

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,890
alright so basically the desktop doesn't

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,060
talk to the native file system it

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,270
doesn't talk to the operating system

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,950
file system it talks to gvfs and GPSS is

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,540
its own layer so now you have to go

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,830
through at least two transitions just to

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,260
get to the file system you have to go

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,520
from the desktop to gvfs gvfs to bounce

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,890
around in there and then the bounce out

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,960
to the file system and then back that

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,000
adds a lot of time delay a lots a lot of

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,930
interference between actually doing

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,080
stuff with the operating system

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,820
directory inotify is another one where

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,640
it tries to again provide a little shim

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,290
layer to try and get filesystem events

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:25,370
and notifications and stuff I know that

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:26,630
that's yes not sure exactly it comes

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,700
from the Linux meaning I can't remember

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,500
exactly which project started putting

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,209
that I know that's one of the pieces of

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,759
gvfs so my

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,170
project but it could be something else

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:44,029
they're like oh we like that we'll just

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:45,019
use it yeah so it might be something I

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:46,490
don't know where it comes from but it's

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,009
just another example of something that

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,459
interferes with the workings of the file

00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,350
system from the operating system itself

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:57,050
what about bypassing user restrictions

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,999
who use policy kit D bus and stuff are

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,249
you aware that a lot of that is

00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,290
specifically designed to bypass user

00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:06,619
restrictions as set by the operating

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,470
system so D bus in particular you start

00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:11,420
a route D best session and then you can

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,009
talk to the routes session to tell it to

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,300
do things even from your user if you're

00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,379
using just even if you use it doesn't

00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,600
have permission to actually change the

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,309
route or do anything like that so it's a

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,540
way of getting around the system

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:22,540
provided permission settings

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,170
what about removable device management

00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:30,290
bypassing that how many views how deep

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,480
or an auto mount system or an autorun

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,819
system sorry I my slides being cut off

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,199
just a little bit on the side but it's

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:38,990
like okay when you plug in a removable

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,819
device unknown or whatever what does it

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,379
do it automatically mounts it on the

00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:43,999
filesystem so it's basically exerting

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:45,199
control over that device instead of

00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,879
letting the operating system do its

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,959
thing with it says no I want you to do

00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:53,589
this I want you to do it this way and is

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,759
that really the way it should work

00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:57,259
Network shared network protocols I

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,139
mentioned the supplier managers if you

00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:01,100
want to browse a shared network in KDE

00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:03,319
or plasma

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,630
use the ocular file manager the file

00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:07,549
manager is what sets up the Samba

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,740
connection is what sets up the NFS

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:11,539
connection and it's going through the

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,949
file manager to actually talk to the

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,529
shared network it's not going through

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,850
the operating system is that really the

00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:18,110
right way to do it or does that fall

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,949
under the realm of something the

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,059
operating system should be controlling

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,250
hardware management what about things

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:27,770
like you power it tries to provide its

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,450
own power control mechanisms for the

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,300
operating system instead of just using

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,050
whatever the

00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,570
system already has and I think basically

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:38,610
when you look at all this stuff and what

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,620
you see is going on in the desktops it

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:42,180
immediately begs the question it makes

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,450
you realize that what's going on is that

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,950
the desktops are trying to enforce

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:50,070
standardized operating system

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,350
interactions all the desktops want the

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,640
same things from the operating systems

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,510
but they're all doing it in different

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,220
ways

00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:01,770
so essentially what they need they just

00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,260
mean it's an operating system API there

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:05,940
needs to be a standardized API for

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,410
operating systems and desktops to

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,580
communicate with each other right now

00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,020
it's kind of been hit or miss

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,030
everybody's like oh I'll just use this

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,160
utility for that or that utility but

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,350
that would be different for some Linux

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,030
distro as opposed to FreeBSD or open BSD

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,920
we have different utilities for things

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,350
but oh that desktop doesn't use that it

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,790
says I only want that one utility which

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,790
doesn't work on other operating systems

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,470
so let's go into the same questions but

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,640
let's go through a little bit more about

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,850
how them one is different

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,850
yes

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:49,840
how it does the fire calls that dolphin

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,940
thank you thank you yes not ocular

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,420
you're right how ocular is the PDF your

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:58,179
dolphin is the file manager sorry

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:02,679
yeah dolphin and Nautilus for them

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,820
actually they may in change that yeah I

00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,760
think they change that it's no longer

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,140
not man yeah yeah sorry thank you for

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,460
thank you for correcting me yes oculars

00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,660
the PDF here not the file manager

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,070
alright so how those lumina difference

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,950
so let's go into the question okay what

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,600
is the desktop so what you see for most

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,309
of the common open source desktops

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,370
they're all developed on clinics and you

00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:28,720
see mainly they come under these couple

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:31,090
groups KDE plasma gnome and other

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,740
derivatives they all tend to take the

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,740
all-in-one approach there's lots of

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,750
dependencies when you install KDE for

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,790
instance how many different packages do

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,740
you have to install how many different

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,419
utilities does that install with this so

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,940
those take definitely the all-in-one

00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,290
approach ORS let you install us we take

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,750
over your system you don't need anything

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,760
else all you need is us alright

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,140
you could install other applications but

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,570
you don't need to that's their

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,110
methodology they assume that oh okay and

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,610
that from a developer perspective from a

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,169
desktop developer perspective in the

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,669
first place that actually makes a whole

00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:05,530
lot of sense you want something like

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,990
that when you're working like on a small

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,940
appliance something that the user

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,559
doesn't have direct control over they

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,940
can't go and install other stuff you

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,490
want to make sure that there's one thing

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,929
that you install as a distributor and

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,130
then that's it you don't have to worry

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,200
about anything else you don't have to

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,460
worry about the user customizing it so

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,590
that makes more sense from an appliance

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,250
standpoint not so much for like a global

00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,940
Universal desktop standpoint

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,740
xfce LX QT and lumina one fall under

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,600
more of this other category it's a

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,280
little bit more modular it's independent

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
from the applications that we

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,960
separate the desktop from the

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,300
applications that you're running it's

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,090
primarily just the interface so it will

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,830
be course money to get into plasma but

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,350
it usually still requires several

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,250
runtime processes so when you say start

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,520
the desktop

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,990
it doesn't just run one thing it runs a

00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,730
few things that starts up the window

00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,500
manager it starts up the session manager

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,090
it starts up the desktop the key manager

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,560
it starts up you know all those various

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,400
utilities that we talked about earlier

00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,250
so you still have some of that there

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,200
where Lumina 2 is different Lumina 2 is

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,240
still in development right now is the

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,270
next major iteration of luminometer

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,290
proceeding very very quickly on this it

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,510
also follows the interface only approach

00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,860
but there are couple things here it does

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,190
not require any operating system

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,780
services and this comes really becomes

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,370
really important when you start looking

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,990
at actually your startup times and your

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,270
boot up times especially on any of the

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,860
vsts whatever how many system services

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,050
do you have to start before the desktop

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,490
itself can start do you have to start up

00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,970
something like healthy do you have to

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,620
start up d-bus do you have to start up

00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,300
console kit or system D you know

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,340
whatever system these absorb a lot of

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,410
that but you see where I'm going what

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,620
else needs to be there before it can run

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:56,200
with Illumina nothing we wanted to it's

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,570
a single binary that you can just run

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,420
directly now I mentioned the single

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,370
binary next life and it only requires a

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,370
couple libraries it requires the Qt 5

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:09,520
libraries unlink and a couple X 11

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:11,470
libraries at the moment we do have plans

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,210
to move to Wayland eventually and we've

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,640
already compartmentalised our code so

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,230
that all the x11 code is in one or two

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,340
very distinct spots all we have to do is

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,640
we do that without touching anything

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,870
else to switch the Wayland and it's

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,210
completely independent from the

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,980
applications so it is completely

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,290
separate and of the applications it

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,420
doesn't it doesn't install libraries the

00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,160
applications look to and expect to be

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,430
there to run so like the KDE

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,900
applications expect KDE libraries to be

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,220
there you don't get any of that with one

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,720
a standalone thing that's just the

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,250
interface you don't have applications

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,300
written for it so much they don't

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,300
require that you're right

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,920
so basically it kind of breaks down like

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:59,360
this what is a simple task when you

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,010
start opening ended up actually ends up

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
being just a little bit more complicated

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:05,270
you have a number of moving pieces in

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,890
there and this is much more so with

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,990
Illumina - because we're simplifying it

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,200
for the end-user you're seeing one thing

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,610
and one process one binary but we still

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,200
have to have all those compatibilities

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,090
you still have all that stuff underneath

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,940
so it ends up this is a lot of workings

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,580
underneath the hood so this leads it to

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,740
how its assembled with other desktops

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,780
they just move on other binaries and

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,820
processes oh somebody wrote this utility

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,780
I really like I'm gonna require that for

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,700
the desktop and I'll maybe I'll

00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,580
automatically start it and stuff that's

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,440
how a lot of it happens they generally

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,620
use d-bus as their inter process

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,230
communication glue so when you start the

00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,120
desktop it's sent out a boolean new bus

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,860
call saying hey start this start that

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,870
start this start that start that o is

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,150
this right yet no okay wait knack keep

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,650
asking it again it's running yet things

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,170
like that to try and get the timing

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,690
events they don't run into racing it's

00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,340
very very hideous try to map it out I

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,190
did that once I looked at the screen but

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:04,160
there's no way I can show this is this

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,590
two idiots all right similarly they're

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,450
moving toward the concept of more

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,370
as as services so wait a minute your

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,020
applications I mean even if you can't

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,669
see it there's no way for the user to

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,010
know it's running but is still running

00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:16,630
that eats up a lot of CPU that takes up

00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,070
a lot of memory even if the user can't

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,000
see it and can't stop it because they

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,559
just don't know what's running it in the

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,200
first place you see that else especially

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,669
in a lot of phones and stuff like the

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,730
iPhones and androids and stuff how do

00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,559
you kill an application you close it oh

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,029
wait a minute they didn't actually kill

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,289
the application is still running you

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,150
just don't see the window anymore

00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:35,860
is that kind of thing but the linux

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,590
desktops are even more moving towards

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,990
that mentality they also tend to have

00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,299
highly fragmented core they install a

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,220
bunch of libraries they stall a bunch of

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,990
binaries and utilities and they kind of

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,940
expect that all the be running and some

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,120
magic sequence but it's so that things

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:54,159
start up properly with lumina too as I

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,559
mentioned just a month ago it's a single

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,570
binary it does not install any libraries

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,909
of its own it is a literally a single

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,429
binary it is a single process - it's a

00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:06,100
threaded highly fragmented on the inside

00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:07,750
but you get all those speed boosts by

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,880
things talking to wreckage from each

00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,289
other within the same process behind a

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,120
dialog through all these external

00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:15,669
frameworks this gives me much much

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,850
faster response time and much much

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:21,220
better performance we also have been

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:24,730
building towards a formalized JSON API

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,590
for applications or users via scripts or

00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:29,380
things like that to talk to the desktop

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,570
to ask the desktop to do things so you

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,850
basically run the lumina desktop command

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,190
and say Lumina desktop and then here's a

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,770
block of JSON to say do this or whatever

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,120
and then the desktop will do it or not

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,860
depending on the situation of the

00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,870
desktop right now for instance if the

00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,240
screen is locked you don't want to have

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,950
somebody scripting hey I want you to

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,000
launch this application and do this and

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,570
do it you don't want to do that when the

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,370
springs locked

00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,309
alright this shouldn't actually be tuned

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,020
doing anything like that similarly we

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,940
have with quality transient applications

00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,559
that's I would say the older style of

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,630
applications when you see it it's

00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,010
running if you don't see it on the

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,169
screen and you don't see it in the test

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,299
manager it's not running we've actually

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:10,539
stopped it all right we take more of

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:12,480
that approach to applications similarly

00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,860
we have a unified core and it's in

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,240
pendant from all those extra

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,890
applications are installed gnome

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,620
applications you can install KDE

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,210
applications Lumina doesn't care what

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,010
the applications are you can install

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,169
anything or everything that you want and

00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,000
they'll run just fine because all it's

00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,559
doing is the standardization for the

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,600
desktop and the interface itself and

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,620
it'll interface with whatever it needs

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,090
to following the standards so basically

00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,890
it kind of comes down to this picture

00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,710
this is a good just visual summary of

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,030
this the common linux desktops are kind

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,770
of like this there's a million buttons

00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,020
each one of them does something

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,210
different trying to find the right

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,250
button to push to do the right thing

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,630
gets to be a nightmare especially when

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,690
you start looking at non Linux operating

00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,040
systems that use different utilities in

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,220
the back end all of a sudden everything

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,200
changes again whereas lumina 2 is trying

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,809
to be more the simple approach we have

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,660
unified methods we have standardized

00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:09,390
interactions and then we have good

00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,429
document highly documented like API

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,960
calls and stuff like that so for any

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,210
standards that we need to create

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,150
ourselves outside from the universally

00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,740
accepted standards so simple is very

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,260
very nice but it's also a lot harder to

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,120
do just because there's still much more

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,500
involved behind the scenes with the

00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,270
users don't actually see so what about

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,440
the operating system interactions before

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,940
I go into this let me ask is there any

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,100
questions on that first now are you a

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,380
following am I losing any of you I mean

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,390
I as the developer I can dig deep so I

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,419
tried I'm trying to hesitate the simple

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,700
okay all right so that's one of the

00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,190
operating system interactions most of

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,370
other desktops are Linux centric and

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,270
what I mean by that is they're developed

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,280
on Linux

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,380
there's tributed for Linux the

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,220
dependencies that they require for the

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,190
desktops tend to be for Linux this

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,230
really becomes apparent when you try to

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,419
port some of these other desktops like

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,080
Katie here no more xfce

00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,020
to one of the BSD operating systems

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,470
because Linux is a

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:21,770
her home and the desktop in many ways

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,780
has evolved to fill the gap in there of

00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,070
adding to the kernel the stuff that's

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,340
necessary in providing the

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,770
standardization of the Linux desktop ok

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,750
but the BSD is you have a complete

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,430
operating system already and none of

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,920
that operating system is a part of these

00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,440
desktops so you run into a conflict

00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,150
between the linux desktops trying to

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,100
install and use applications for

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,600
operating system functionality that

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,380
conflict with current operating system

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,850
functionality so that's the first thing

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,520
that you see with just the way the

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,560
desktops are designed there they often

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,420
tend to control the operating system

00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,740
capabilities again by becoming part of

00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,810
the operating system they're exerting

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,320
dominance over what the operating system

00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,150
can and can't do the desktop basically

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,580
exerting it says I'm the dominant want

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,870
you need to go through me and it

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,420
provides a multitude of utilities for

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,210
other operating system taxes alumina 2

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,130
is OS agnostic again by just being an

00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,260
interface it's not trying to exert

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,330
dominance we actually say the OS is

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,940
dominant for alumina instead of trying

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,530
to say hey OS they plugged in a device I

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,140
see they plugged in the device I need

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,390
you to do this to amount to or make it

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,120
available and open something alumina

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,710
doesn't do that instead Lumina just says

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,600
and has standardized interactions that

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,150
says oh the operating system just

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,090
registered a file saying a device is now

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:43,010
available and I can do XYZ with it so

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,600
Lumina just makes that available to the

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,280
user and the user can decide whether

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,230
they want to mount it whether they want

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,400
to actually open it we're doing anything

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,260
with it's a very different mentality

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,060
it's a much more of a passive desktop

00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,070
mentality it's letting the operating

00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,130
system do its stuff and then just

00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,170
listening for the standard events and

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,860
standard messages from the operating

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,140
system and then presenting those

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,090
choices to the user it doesn't make

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,980
assumptions about what the user expects

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,929
to do with the desktop or expects to do

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,700
with the device because for instance an

00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,670
optical device let's say a DVD or a

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,500
blu-ray if your file system or your

00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,910
desktop says oh they looked at a device

00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,340
let's automatically mount it and browse

00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,510
it with a blu-ray or a DVD that means

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,240
hey you're browsing a whole bunch of

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,549
files on an optical data disc if you can

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
even mount it properly because in order

00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:30,390
to actually play a DVD or blu-ray you

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,880
can't mount the device you're supposed

00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:35,100
to read it raw as raw bytes from the

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,570
disk so that it can be played at the VLC

00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,830
player or things like that if you

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,950
actually mount it you can't access it

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,940
properly so again that just comes into

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,620
one of the differences there's a whole

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,040
lot of variants and differences in how

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,690
you deal with devices there so lumina -

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,070
takes it again a very what I would call

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,799
a little bit more passive of an approach

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,870
we treat the operating system as King we

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,940
are just an interface for the operating

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,140
system we are not trying to control the

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,270
operating system if that makes sense and

00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,740
then what other utilities do we install

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,620
for controlling a foreign system well

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,390
done if you're running lumina on an

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,760
operating system we expect that your

00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:15,059
operating system already has utilities

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,580
for controlling itself yes does that

00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:22,350
mean that lumina 2 would be easily

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:24,660
portable to a Linux operating system yes

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,280
even more portable than lumina one is

00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,370
which is already available on Linux

00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,350
operating systems so yeah Lumina has

00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,260
already kind of got this alumina 2 is

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,270
taking it to the next step Lumina 1 is

00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,850
already highly portable important to all

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,010
the BSD s almost all the Linux operating

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,480
systems as far as I know we don't do the

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,590
porting ourselves but we have a lot of

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,780
people that work with us to make

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,310
official packages available in the

00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,930
official repositories you don't like to

00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,180
say oh yeah there's a limit package for

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,620
Debian you got to go to this users repo

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,210
you may have signed that he may not have

00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,740
you don't quite know he can just run a

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,230
curl command it's okay I said you know

00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,970
it's alright no we don't do anything

00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,620
like that we try to say no no no it

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,270
needs to be an official package in an

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,310
official repository so we don't try to

00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:09,540
provide official packages for stuff that

00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:11,700
we can't officially test so it's kind of

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,790
like this how many steps do you have to

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,770
go through to actually ask the operating

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,060
system to do something if you want to if

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,410
you want to treat the door like the

00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,080
operating system and say okay I want to

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,250
unhook the chain how many steps do you

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,220
have to do from the Linux desktop

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,950
perspective what you often see is that

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,650
the desktop talks to d-bus which talks

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,780
to you know a policy kit console kit

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,640
whatever which then dials out to

00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,530
something like Pam which then dials up

00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,150
something else to talk to the OS and

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,550
then it has to go back through those

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,710
same you know five or six or ten steps

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,630
before you can even get a reply to find

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,860
out if it's possible and then you got to

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,440
do it again I'm telling it what it can

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,600
actually do so it's like this is long

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,390
complicated back and forth and it just

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,190
ends up being like a maze so it's like

00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:58,320
it's so much harder than just you know

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,030
talking to the operating system directly

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,430
and say oh the operating system already

00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,780
told me this is the command to do this

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,400
this is the command to do that and just

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,560
showing that to the user so you have a

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,480
one thing one thing you need to do and

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:16,920
that's it it makes it much simpler much

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:18,780
faster so in conclusion just to kind of

00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,360
summarize this it's a whole big ball of

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,950
wax again it's probably stuff a lot of

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,210
you have seen or maybe even thought

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,530
about is we were running desktops

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,440
especially if you happen to open up the

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,080
terminal look at what's going on

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,440
underneath the hood but essentially what

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,730
I think this all boils down to is this

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,650
open-source desktops are kind of

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,110
approaching a crossroads here pretty

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,800
quickly do we follow the example of

00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,990
Windows and try to become a piece of the

00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,970
operating system all right because if

00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,180
you look at Windows you can't really

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,450
separate the desktop from the operating

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,649
system and they're trying to now

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,240
because they've realized that that

00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,769
doesn't work very well they're trying to

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,309
go to things like PowerShell and stuff

00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:03,649
and their servers and try and go more

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:05,450
unix-like in that way because that

00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:07,070
methodology doesn't work but in the

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,609
linux desktops you see them trying to

00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:12,020
copy windows more so it's like you're at

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:14,990
a crossroads do you want to keep doing

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:18,500
that or do you want to create a more

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:20,389
standardized interface which is more

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,419
what kind of the universe is going to

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:25,250
cuz interface could be for all sorts of

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:27,859
devices I mean desktops aren't the thing

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,990
anymore right how many of you use

00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:31,399
tablets how many views phones how many

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,079
of you actually sit at your desktop

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,329
computer where that is the majority of

00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,879
your time now I would say that for the

00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:39,940
bulk of consumers most people use

00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:43,280
portable devices now instead of actually

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:46,280
desktops so the desktop paradigm that

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,720
the people like at KDE and Gnome and

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,300
stuff have been trying to trump it for a

00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,609
while they've been building it on this

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,639
methodology on a particular type of

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,139
hardware platform which is slowly going

00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,450
away it's not gonna die out completely

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:02,180
because you need systems you need

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,980
desktops to get especially a lot of work

00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,480
done and work off the spaces and stuff

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,040
like that you really there is a really a

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,660
good use case for it but it's not as

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,839
popular anymore because you don't need

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:15,530
it for the mass consumer so if you did

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,020
not develop a generic interface it

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,400
becomes separate from the type of

00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,829
hardware it doesn't have to be just for

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,060
4k monitors or 1080p monitors and stuff

00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:25,730
like that it could be for a little tiny

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,190
handheld device if the interface is

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,540
flexible it could be for tablet so it

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,089
could be for whatever it's returning it

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,740
back to the roots of just dealing with

00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:38,390
the graphical side of things I'm letting

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,400
the operating system alone so with the

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,440
lumina project we're trying to take the

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,780
other fork if you will we're trying to

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,470
return back to standardization back to

00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:51,589
centralized standardized interactions

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:53,240
and really a much more limited scope for

00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:54,950
the desktop we're not trying to do

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,510
everything we're not trying to thanks

00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,570
and we don't think the desktop should

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,790
try to manage the

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:05,020
so that's just the way we're going with

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:07,810
a limit of two I love this picture I saw

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,250
it somebody else is lying ahead but this

00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,840
is probably one of the biggest questions

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,190
I get when people find out that I was

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,450
writing the desktops like why would you

00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,010
bother there's already somebody doesn't

00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,690
ops out there why don't you just copy

00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,270
let's came to you or just something like

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,550
that's like no no no you have to

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,840
reinvent the wheel from time to time the

00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,700
trick is knowing when and how

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,080
and that really is comes down to the key

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,240
every once in a while you need that

00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,830
little bit of a revolution to reinvent

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,960
instead of constantly building on the

00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:36,070
same stale frameworks that don't work

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,200
anymore so and with that I will go ahead

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:40,780
and open the floor for questions

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,580
do any of you have questions and I

00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:52,420
believe there's a microphone here let me

00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:54,700
see this word okay it does work so would

00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,280
you mind you this around people have

00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,200
questions all right so any questions

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,430
just for a video recording and stuff we

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,900
should probably speak into the

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:09,220
microphone yes sir I've got a couple

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,520
going through much on the slides first

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:15,160
of all I guess the robustness of the

00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,560
desktop I don't have a lot of history to

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:23,170
prove this but in my experience the

00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:26,160
desktops of it that's not - about to be

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,160
brutal it every night

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:32,530
if next place or know where something

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,840
starts misbehaving or crashes the simple

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,030
solutions routines box yeah so something

00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,130
like lumina being the single process is

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,990
something that we could actually drop

00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,090
into a shell or actually remotely

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,150
kill the process of restarted yes

00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,650
without having to go yeah that kind of

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:56,080
segues into the second question then

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:59,650
from a server perspective do we sort of

00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:07,060
the way you would X forward a desktop

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:09,640
system remotely like on the thin flan

00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,770
I'm hosting I got you know server

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,010
Herbert and data center somewhere but

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:22,120
locally I have this finder pull that

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:23,410
information forward that executor

00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,000
Rayment know but that's actually

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,860
something we've already done within the

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,410
truest project we have a project called

00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,890
true OS Pico where uses a Raspberry Pi

00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:35,440
hence the name Kiko as a remote

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:38,440
graphical thin client where basically

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,030
you have a desktop server basically in

00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,090
the backroom it's not hooked up to any

00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,280
monitors but then your high connected

00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,170
via network can find the system and give

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,150
you graphical prompts to it kind of like

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,280
you would get an SSH session or

00:38:49,150 --> 00:39:02,380
something but it's a graphical session

00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:03,910
instead of a terminal session yes that

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,470
does make that a lot easier and we

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,420
actually have some special stuff in

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,640
Lumina because we're developing moving

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,440
on specific before the true us project

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,450
even if it's cross-platform we do have

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,070
some special glue in there for true a

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,210
specific projects and things and that's

00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,100
one of the ones that we have some

00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,100
special things in there for and it does

00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,750
work very very well by the same token

00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,820
though you were talking about how

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,170
desktops are consumer-grade they're

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,710
designed to be rebooted every night

00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,630
Luminas not load I can be run months up

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,009
time of months

00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,049
all right and that's actually part of

00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:35,579
the tests that we do with Roma because

00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:37,049
with the truest project we used to

00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:40,140
actually do that and leave different

00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:41,069
desktops up for weeks at a time and see

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,740
what was happening and we would

00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:45,210
constantly see with KDE and Gnome that

00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,099
they're either leaking memory or

00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,200
constantly using more memory all the

00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:51,000
time and that's why you have to reboot

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,710
your system all the time to free up all

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,890
that stale memory and stuff which

00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,869
they've allocated and not used so with

00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,700
Lumina we actually do the same tests and

00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:02,579
we make sure that now it actually does

00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:05,369
not only free up memory properly but it

00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:07,559
returns back down to minimal levels or

00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:09,539
even over long periods of time so that

00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,069
you know the amount of memory it uses

00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:12,809
when you first start it up is the exact

00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:15,660
same as you get three months after

00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:17,220
uptime so we've gone through and done

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,170
all those scalability tests so you don't

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:24,390
have to worry about the fragility of the

00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,220
desktop itself and you can do that with

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:28,349
a single binary much much easier than

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,400
you can with a whole bunch of binaries

00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:36,280
all trying to manage memory

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:40,050
independently yes sir

00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,430
so I ran the i3 window manager yes and

00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,860
early on I had a lot of trouble getting

00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,260
it to open the right files to the right

00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,250
application and a lot of this stuff

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:53,050
that's codified in the desktop standards

00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,910
yes so you had end of them to install a

00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,690
bunch of little utilities that you don't

00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,850
know whether they're going to be

00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:01,510
supported or not is it possible to use

00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:03,400
Lumina as the desktop because I refused

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,950
to install the gnome the gbms and all

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,380
that I install Lumina and use a three as

00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,200
a window manager yes officially with

00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,060
Lumina one you can do that we use

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,220
fluxbox as the window manager in the

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,170
backend of Lumina one and we require

00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,970
that but we do have a hook in the

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,560
configuration option that lets you

00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,390
switch it out with something else like

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,670
i3 actually i3 is one of the most

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:27,280
popular options that I've heard from our

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,620
users so I mean you can do that you just

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,270
have to there's a little warning that ok

00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,670
then some of the configuration options

00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,800
and things that Lumina gives you access

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,390
to those will no longer work because

00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,820
those expect voxbox

00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,500
so you'll have to configure i3 yourself

00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,870
for that respect you're kind of on your

00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,100
own with regards to that but again if

00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,360
you're already switching to a different

00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,230
window manager is kind of understood

00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,230
that you know how to configure

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,120
[Laughter]

00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:02,089
all right I've probably got one minute

00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,440
left if I'm supposed to end it 10:45

00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:05,239
which i think is there right so one

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,900
minute left any last minute to Rosario

00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:12,049
when is the ministry ready okay

00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:13,460
Lumina 2 is in a pre-alpha right now we

00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,650
have the window manager stuff

00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,630
implemented and functional we have the

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,549
screen saver of screen locker systems

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,019
implemented and functional we're still

00:42:19,549 --> 00:42:22,460
finishing up some of the standard

00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:24,529
support for the wicked manager side of

00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,509
things really the big thing that we're

00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:28,700
working on now is we're cleaning up all

00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:31,160
of the graphics of luma itself because

00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,049
right now we use pure QT and stuff but

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,729
in order to actually do like the window

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,140
events for the window management stuff

00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:39,619
you really need something better than

00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,210
CPU acceleration so we're doing a lot of

00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:45,799
work right now to make sure that we have

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:47,509
fully OpenGL and GPU accelerated code

00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:49,069
for all window graphics and everything

00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:51,079
for the desktop itself so that's the

00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:53,599
next big push but I'm hoping to have

00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:55,789
like a beta of Luna 2 out of my

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,259
beginning the next year that's that's

00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,869
the rough schedule we'll see how things

00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:09,859
slip but at the timeframe at least we're

00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:11,509
looking at all right ok well I will take

00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,450
another couple minutes I don't see the

00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:15,680
next presenter in the back anywhere No

00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:22,309
ok we'll go ahead and take a couple more

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,599
minutes any other questions alright so I

00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:25,099
have to take a poll now now that

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,440
everybody's here I want to take a quick

00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:31,339
poll how many of you before this talk

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,499
had even heard about Lumina about half

00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:34,819
of you that's pretty good I wasn't I was

00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:36,170
worried it's the Linux conference you

00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:37,700
see a lot of stuff about lumen on the

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,769
BSD is I don't really see as much on the

00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,390
Linux side except for our specific

00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:42,920
people that are making the packages we

00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:47,239
have a lot of people that are very very

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,710
happy about it and stuff but so I'll say

00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:52,779
thank you very much for coming to my

00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,779
talk about limit at a Linux conference

00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,960
