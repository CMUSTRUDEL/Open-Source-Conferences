Description: 
	Speaker: Evan Miller


This talk covers why the linux/open source crowd are the perfect folks to work in offensive security, a.k.a penetration testing, and how to get started. This will be a combination of career guidance and available tools to get started, including an overview of OWASP’s Juice Shop and other resources.

This comes with obligatory disclaimers: don’t use any of this for anything illegal or evil.
