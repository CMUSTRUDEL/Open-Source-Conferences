Publication date: 2021-01-06
Playlist: 2020 Videos
Description: 
	Speaker: Evan Miller


This talk covers why the linux/open source crowd are the perfect folks to work in offensive security, a.k.a penetration testing, and how to get started. This will be a combination of career guidance and available tools to get started, including an overview of OWASP’s Juice Shop and other resources.

This comes with obligatory disclaimers: don’t use any of this for anything illegal or evil.

	00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,440
i wanted to do a talk about

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,720
careers in offensive security so um

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,080
you could say i started as a linux

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,040
administrator i would say i started as a

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,720
customer support uh technical support

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
person um

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
and that was kind of the beginning of my

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,960
career which we'll actually cover in a

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,039
minute but

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,720
um i kind of i just just to kind of

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
introduce the talk a little bit i wanted

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,199
to cover

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,679
what well first off what offensive

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,640
security is right it's kind of a big

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,920
field

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
um and there's a lot of different

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,920
elements to it and then who might be

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
kind of a good candidate for it

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
in my opinion and hopefully get some

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,280
people interested because it's a field

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,039
that i think you know it needs more

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
folks and we need

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,239
more talent and and i just you know i

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
really want to kind of just share like

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,520
my passion for all of it so i'm really

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,199
excited to have the opportunity to do

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
that today

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
so um we're going to jump in so like i

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
said an introduction so

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
um i do have to preface just a little

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
bit on the legal side of course we're

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,199
gonna we're gonna actually have a little

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
bit of a demo where we're gonna

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,520
show some things that um are legal only

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,119
if you're doing it on

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
your systems and or systems that you

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
have authorization for

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
um so just to kind of keep that in mind

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
right this is educational purposes only

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
um you can hack anything that you own

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
right you have kind of that legal

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
permission for

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,439
um or if you have kind of that written

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,200
you know legal permission obtained

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,880
and if you don't know if it's legal or

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
okay to do then just don't do it

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
um you know do some research figure it

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
out

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,360
and of course you know understand what

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,400
the laws say about this things you know

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
the

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,680
um there's numerous kind of laws that

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
cover this kind of stuff but

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,119
in any case lastly you know on this be

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,119
ethical

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,880
um one of the important things for

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,880
people in this field is

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
it's companies have to put a high level

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,000
of trust in in an organization

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
and an individual to do it

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
the amount of times you know even in

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,759
just the last few years that i've had

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,960
the ability to like completely

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,399
a hospital is really uncomfortable for

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
me and i'm not bragging

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,759
i'm just saying you know that's kind of

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
a lot right and

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,120
so for people that want to be in this

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
position

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
i can't stress enough how important it

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,599
is to be a person of high

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
kind of moral fiber if that makes sense

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,120
um obviously if you want to kind of hack

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
around at home and have fun with kind of

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
your own lab and stuff that's a

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
different question but

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
um which is you know of course kind of

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
that last bullet there

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
um definitely do um if you're at all

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
interested

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
do spend the time set up your own lab

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
we're gonna have a tool here today

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,920
uh that that it's really easy and you

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
actually don't even have to set up your

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
own lab there's

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
web interface and all that stuff so

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
it'll make it easy for you

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,319
so um so me right i

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
i have a certified ethical hacker ceh

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,040
certification

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
um that's kind of a it's kind of a base

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
level really honestly

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
in terms of penetration testing and the

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
offensive security stuff it's kind of

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,000
that

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
fundamental piece um they're in i think

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
it's it's

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,920
raising up a little bit with some of the

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
work they're doing but um

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
that's one plate one thing you could

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,959
look at but um i've been in information

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,040
security for a little over three years

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,200
um and i've been doing pen testing for

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,680
um two to three years

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,319
um so pentesting is you know kind of the

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
the core of what i do here um also i've

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,680
done a lot of you know kind of security

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
risk assessments and we work a lot you

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
can see with

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
the compliance uh in the name we work a

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,959
lot with

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,959
hipaa and medical organizations

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
so i did spend two years as a and well

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
there's actually full review of this but

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,959
i spent two years as a

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,440
linux engineer for tall performance usa

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,879
where that was a whole process um you

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,080
know managing a website that was getting

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,840
if i remember correctly something like

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
40 million hits a day

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
with just me and one other guy and a

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
couple data centers across the world and

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
that was a whole it was a serious

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
process or i learned a lot you know that

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
was my first job

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,280
just doing linux um or my really my only

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,640
job just doing linux i guess

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,319
it's been a few years kind of in the

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,599
general it administration and i've been

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,560
in it like i said

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,600
starting back early uh early on in the

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,079
late 2000s

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,440
uh i'd say early on um early 2000s in

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,320
kind of that customer support i used to

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,440
work for micro micro electronics which

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
is a parent company for

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
micro center which a lot of you guys are

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,880
probably familiar with

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
um so if you called tech support in 2008

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,479
to 2012

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,639
um you know could have been me you never

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
know

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
so my first experience with linux just

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
really quick um in kind of that early

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
2000s time

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,919
um i bought i convinced my parents to

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,199
buy a second hard drive and i decided it

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
would be a great idea to try to put

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,479
fedora on there

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,400
and uh grub i'm saying this purely for

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,320
the perspective of humanizing

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
uh everything so i i had some issues

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
with grub where um

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
i think i changed the boot order when i

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,880
was installing the disc and

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,919
so then sda0 became sda one and

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,199
uh basically the family computer got uh

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,199
it was kind of it was worked for a

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
little bit um

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
so uh that was the first thing that i

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
did right everybody's gotta start

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,360
somewhere

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
um that was pretty it was pretty early

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
on um

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,039
in that space and um but eventually you

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
know i got everything working and it was

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
a lot of fun

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
uh to to be there and i knew at that

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
point that that's kind of

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,360
where one of the one of the key places

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,400
that i wanted to spend most of my career

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,160
uh learning a lot about the ethos of

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,639
open source and linux

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
yeah i mean it made a huge impact on who

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
i am as a person

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,880
so there's a there's a lot of of me that

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,840
goes in there

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,759
uh and just purely to kind of enrage you

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,800
know a third to half of the environment

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,160
um i i'm a vim user um i was in the

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,319
slack channel talking about that a few

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,000
minutes ago or an hour or two ago

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,240
um emacs and and uh vim and how um

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
space max i think is what was called

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,039
that's kind of bridging that gap and

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,560
um that's a very you know uh just i just

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,840
say that kind of for fun but i

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
i definitely uh have opened emacs and

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,160
gone

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
oh now just like i did the first time i

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
opened vim

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,240
how do i get out of this so

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,520
um we'll take a look so

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,720
why are we talking about this stuff

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,919
today so first of all offensive security

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
is growing right there's there's

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,199
actually more kind of

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
legal things that are happening right

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
there are new laws that are uh

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
encouraging or even

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
some in some cases requiring penetration

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,639
tests

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,240
um so that's penetration tests being

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,000
part of offensive security

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,080
um it's it's it's it's really it's cool

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,360
um it's cool for me right and it's good

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,319
for the companies because having a

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
penetration test

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,440
is a really good thing to do

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
you can spend all your time setting up

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
security but until you've had

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,720
somebody come and try to actually kick

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,120
the door down you

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,080
can't really be 100 sure how well that

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,080
security is working

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
you know obviously more breaches are

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,919
happening just last week

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,039
um the week before last uh there was a

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,960
a big release from saisa and

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,160
and nist two of the government

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,400
organizations that cover

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
um information security for the

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,680
organization

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
um where you know they talked about this

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
increased ransomware risk and all the

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
stuff and

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
and it's just you know it's a big it's a

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
big deal

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,960
and which is kind of part of why sea

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,000
levels are paying more attention now

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
it's it's

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
hopefully you know the organization

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
where you work is forward-thinking

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
enough to realize hey

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,520
security is a big deal if we just kind

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
of brush that under the rug

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,680
our entire company could get locked up

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
behind some you know hopefully

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,879
when we pay the 10 million dollars in

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,879
bitcoin

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,000
a la garmin uh we don't know if they

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,280
paid that or not

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,879
uh earlier this year um then

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,520
hopefully our cup will get our company

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
back um

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
you know what are you gonna do that's a

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,599
huge risk so

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
and like i mentioned earlier i'm just

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
incredibly passionate about this stuff

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,599
this is something that i do

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,960
you know a lot of um even kind of in my

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
free time

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,400
and i want to kind of grow that

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,479
community of people who are in the

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,080
offensive security field and then i

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
think there's there are already

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,519
existing connections between kind of

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,440
linux open source

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,000
and the ethical hacking communities um

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
but you know those are communities that

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,760
have so much in common

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
that um i think it's important to have a

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
dialogue

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
between them and kind of hopefully build

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,360
build a lot of a lot

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
build even more bridges if that makes

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,080
sense

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,839
so really briefly right offensive

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
security i mentioned kind of pen testing

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,000
is part of offensive security so

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
i want to talk about what offensive

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
security is i'm going to talk about who

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
i think is going to be a good candidate

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
for this and then why i think that a lot

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,240
of people from the open source community

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
are going to be good candidates too if

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
it's something that they're interested

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
in

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,000
um so offensive security this is kind of

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
a list of some of the things that are in

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
there and it's not necessarily an

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
exhaustive list but offensive security

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,040
is

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,800
um you know hacking for for good

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
right um it's kind of taking that stance

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,959
of of

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,440
you know putting on your um uh

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,800
i guess not really putting on the the uh

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
the superhero costume i guess you're

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
putting on a super villain costume for a

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,800
couple minutes

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
and just trying to see what what you can

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
do um

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
so penetration testing right that's

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,800
where there's a few different kind of

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,920
examples

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
you know one might be um you know

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
a lot of times you call in an external

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
penetration test where would be trying

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
to hack into their organization from the

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
outside doing things like phishing

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
sending trying to get people to give

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,320
credentials see if we can bypass

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
multi-factor

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,920
you know exploits over the internet um

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,920
and then kind of an internal piece which

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
is where we would ship a computer and

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
then we'd have that kind of remote

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,279
access or or go on site of course

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,320
and have that remote access to say do

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,920
a lot of that to see what we could do if

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,120
we have that physical access to the

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
network

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,800
um so a red team

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
is sort of sort of um somebody will

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,440
probably get really mad at me for saying

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
this but it's sort of similar to a

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,880
pentest but

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
um i've heard it described as pirates

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
versus ninjas

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
which is a a a penetration test is more

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,519
like a pirate because

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,360
you know it's over the course of a few

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
days or a week or you know maybe two

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
weeks

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,600
um generally speaking and

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
it's more like a pirate because i'm i

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,519
don't really have the time

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
to be as stealthy as i could be so i'm

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
gonna come in i'm gonna you know

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
shoot my cannons i'm gonna board your

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,920
boat i'm gonna take your stuff and i

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,360
really don't care if you know whether i

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,720
was there or not

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,839
um it's it's loud and um

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,880
you know and there's some you know you

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,040
may do things a little bit more

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
stealthily sometimes but

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
then a red team might be over the course

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,160
of a month or more or maybe an existing

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,560
you know engagement where it could be

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,399
over the course of a year or something

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,839
or you could even work on a red team

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,040
within an organization

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,160
where that's your job all the time

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
um and so that would be that's more like

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
a ninja right so

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,839
i'm going to try to steal i'm going to

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
you know sneak past the guards i'm going

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
to hide in the shadows i'm going to

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
break into the vault i'm going to take

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
your gold and i'm going to leave and

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
you're not going to know until three

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,880
weeks later when you go

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,160
to you know try to pay your debts and

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,440
you find out that

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
there's no more gold involved

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
and in theory right if everything's done

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,399
right

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,680
they will have very little if any

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,279
evidence that i was there

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
bounty i think is another one so this is

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
pretty cool there's a few places um

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,160
hacker one bug crowd are two of the

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,760
bigger ones

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
um companies um internet companies a lot

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
of kind of

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
startups and big big internet companies

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,399
even they will put bounties on things

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
you can go

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,160
register you can pass a check and verify

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,600
your id

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
and then you'll be able to obtain

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
authorization to

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
go and test somebody's website and then

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
you

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,839
when you find a vulnerability if you

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
find a vulnerability you write a report

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,160
for them you deliver to them and they

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,360
give you money instead of

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,880
sending you to jail um so that's kind of

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
a middle ground and i think it's it's a

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,279
pretty cool place

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
to be um social engineering's included

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,680
in there of course that's things like

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,399
fishing

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
you know even kind of lying to people's

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
faces

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
in creative ways to get them to do

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,959
things uh phone calls

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,279
sms or smishing whatever however you

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,880
want to say that

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,320
physical penetration testing is one

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
where you might go and break into a

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,839
building

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,000
um that's a whole different kind of kind

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,240
of fish than what i do normally but uh

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
it's a thing you know reverse

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
engineering again which is kind of part

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,000
of that hacking if you're going to try

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
to

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
figure out the vulnerability of an

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,200
application or something

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
or a piece of software or what have you

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
then you might try to reverse engineer

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,519
you might have a binary that you're

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
reverse engineering or something like

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
that to

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,079
try to figure out how you could find

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,240
vulnerabilities in it

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,839
and again generally kind of hacking to

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,079
enhance security so that's kind of the

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,079
key

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,560
um so hacking to enhance security so the

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
first thing right somebody's going to

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,600
pay you

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
to test their security um that's the

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,399
first thing right you're going to get

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,600
kind of that legal authorization

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,720
you're going to have probably a time

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
window and you're going to try to find

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
the vulnerabilities

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,600
you can um and then you're going to

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,199
write them a report

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
and that report is going to be something

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,519
that generally speaking you're going to

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,639
want

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,079
to be understandable at a high level by

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,279
a board by sea level you know executive

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,959
types right

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,399
um i would say normally

00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
the example that i want to give in this

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,040
is something that like your mom would

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,360
understand but

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,240
my mom is also a linux user so she's a

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
little higher

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,720
higher up on that totem pole than a lot

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,240
of people a lot of people's moms but um

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
you know what i'm saying right

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,279
somebody who's generally a non-tech

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
person could get and then of course you

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,079
want to have the

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
another section where it's sort of the

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
nitty-gritty where it's here's the

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
config file that does this and you need

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,519
to go change you know this

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,240
here's your um you know x equals y you

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,240
need to change it to x equals z right

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,199
um whereas you know of course your

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,600
executives don't care about that stuff

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,480
they just kind of want it to work um and

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
then so

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
the end goal is that they're going to be

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
happy because

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,000
these security holes existed whether you

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,680
were there or not right all i'm doing is

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,720
is looking for security holes i'm not

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,480
creating them

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,040
um these are things that um

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
they were there before and i found them

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,720
rather than

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
you know i i created something that's

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
that's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
insecure for you um and

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
and then now they know what to do about

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,279
it so that's obviously pretty exciting

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
for people um

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,920
happiness of course they're happy um

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
some people

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,839
i i the way i explain it a lot of times

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
is um

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,320
when when you hire me to do a pen test

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,279
it's sort of like hiring me to

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
uh like tell me if you're like it's

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
hiring me to

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,399
rate your baby so like you have a baby

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,199
you say is this an attractive baby or

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,240
not

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,800
and i say no that's a really ugly baby

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,040
sorry

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,199
and that's you know it's a hard thing to

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,800
process sometimes so not everybody gets

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,399
gets joy out of it

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,759
um but uh you know it's it's something

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
um so we'll we'll kind of take a look uh

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
at

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
who's who might be a good candidate for

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
this

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,839
um so

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
sorry i just get really dry when i keep

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
talking so

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
um so right i see people so generally

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
speaking right

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
somebody who's going to be a good pen

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,120
tester they're probably not going to go

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
straight

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,199
into offensive security um you're

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
probably going to have to have at least

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,519
some kind of a background

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,680
like self um one of the best things that

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,720
that i have in my career past is is a

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
sort of um uh

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,360
jack of all trades kind of thing

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
especially when i worked for a micro

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
center right we

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
there's no specialization so it was

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
networking it was linux it was hp ux it

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,920
was windows

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,320
um didn't have to deal with macs at that

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
time but you know very broad

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
so i got to kind of get my feet wet in a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
lot of areas and learn

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,720
a lot of different things which has been

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,920
helpful to kind of put pieces together

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,000
but i could definitely understand if

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
you're a specialist um you're a web

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
developer

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,600
right let's say you're a web developer

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,639
there's there's things that you would be

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,959
able to tell me about

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,199
a website and how it's made that i just

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,600
don't know yet

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,199
so specialists are also really helpful

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
um

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,720
i'm a puzzle solver like if you put a

00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,759
puzzle in front of me like i really

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
can't help it

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
um once i know that it's a puzzle and

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,280
it's something that i can solve i'm like

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
oh no and that's that's my thing right i

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,520
have

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,319
um adhd so i'm just a confession time i

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,360
guess

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,959
um so when normal day-to-day stuff

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,520
sometimes it's hard for me to kind of

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,360
focus

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
on things and that's part of the part of

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
the

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,959
thing there um but generally speaking

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,240
with puzzles if it's a puzzle that i'm

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,559
remotely interested in

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,840
i'm just like oh like that's that's i

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,799
get locked in

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,960
right when i do um when i do a

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
penetration test and i'm solving puzzles

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
all day

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,799
uh i'll forget to like eat or go to the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,679
bathroom and it's it's sort of you know

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
i mean

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,320
you know it's it's pretty it's pretty uh

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,240
it's pretty amazing

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,440
um so something else is important is

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,720
people who love to learn

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
so obviously um learning is a huge huge

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,520
part of this

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
you have to you have to be able to learn

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,799
things

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
and you have to want to learn things i'm

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
i'm a perpetual learner

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
like if i'm not learning and or solving

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,679
things i'm bored

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,840
so um there you go um

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,679
so loving to learn is important um at

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,799
least at least a fair level of attention

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,840
to detail

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,400
because when you because there's a lot

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,000
of things that you can miss um you know

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
one of the things that that i learned

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
early on was the time when i was on a

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
penetration test and for anybody who has

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,480
experience in active directory

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,559
um there's you know looking through the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
the users list in active directory and

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,320
and then we see an account that has like

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,679
a random string of 10 characters in the

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,280
description field

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,960
and i just sort of went like oh that's

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,799
weird and then my

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
my boss and mentor at the time he's like

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,880
hey what's that and i'm like i don't

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,080
know

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
is it a password and so that's the first

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
time

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,679
one of the first times that we got a

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,679
domain admin password

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
in the administrative or in the

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
description field in active directory

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
which

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,280
just pro tip is available to anybody on

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
the domain

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,919
so uh don't do that but this is not a

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
windows talk this is a linux and open

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
source talk

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,480
um but i mean a little bit of bad

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,480
mouthing on windows you know

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,679
um and then being willing to fail so

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,000
this is something that was this is

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,480
probably

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
my biggest struggle um because another

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,679
thing that i have going on is something

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
called imposter syndrome which is a very

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,320
interesting thing that basically makes

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
you think that

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,840
everybody's gonna you secretly you don't

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
deserve to be here and everybody's gonna

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,679
find out that you're

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
uh that you're that you've been like

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,559
conning them this whole time

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,919
um and so willing

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,760
being willing to fail while you're in

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,280
that state is very difficult so

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
um but you know it's something that i've

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,080
been dealing with and getting better at

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,160
but for the ideal candidate having some

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,480
level of willingness to fail because

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,679
98 of the things that you try are not

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,960
gonna work

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,480
um and it's it's only that two percent

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,720
or one percent or you know

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
two percent in that example um that that

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,200
are actually going to get you anywhere

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
and so if you don't

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,799
try the first 98 then

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
99 and 100 out of 100 are never gonna

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,000
happen so

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,159
um i guess you could do the whole like

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,080
you miss 100 of the shots you don't take

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,559
wayne gretzky michael scott thing um

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,240
but uh yeah i mean that's kind of the

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,440
gist of that

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,960
and then of course i mentioned before

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
being ethical is a really important part

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,520
um so why the open source community and

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
i'm realizing that i'm just i'm talking

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
a lot and

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
i'm a little behind on time but we're

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,520
going to get there so um many projects

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
of course are open source right a lot of

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,360
people in the community

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,760
when they make a tool they open source

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,440
it goes on github it's you know gpl mit

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
however you want to you know one of

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
those licenses that

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,480
that will um kind of allow other people

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
to use it and modify it and all that

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,280
stuff

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,039
um of course that's an important thing

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
and that is part of the open source

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,120
community right

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,400
um a little different um then you know

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
the people are going to maintain some of

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
the big projects that enterprises are

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,400
running on but

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,799
it's all open for software it's all part

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,080
of the same community

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
i think there's a lot of overlapping

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,039
skill sets and interests between the two

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
right in the open source oh good sorry

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
my uh

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,480
there we go what

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,559
okay sorry um so

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,159
i think there's an overlap in skill sets

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,919
and interests i think that

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,200
there's there's a lot you know of

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,360
capabilities that

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
are going to match up on people who kind

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
of develop

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
you know develop software who work on

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,000
open source projects and

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
have that kind of tinkering mindset

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,559
right and that builders mindset

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,159
um and that also applies in capabilities

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,840
and then i think that that there's a lot

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
of overlap in the ethical standards i

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,400
think that

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,600
you know purely by way of contributing

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
to an open source product

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,760
project in a significant way um

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
you're not necessarily expecting

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
anything in return unless you're doing

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
this part of your job

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
it's kind of a um in a lot of cases it

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,640
can be

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,799
you know a purely good natured thing

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,240
that is a good indicator

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:01,520
for ethical standards right

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,280
so i wanted to take a look at um stardom

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,840
right so obviously this is about careers

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,760
and i've kind of wound around that a lot

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
to give some context

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,880
um but i want to take a look at where

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
you might start so

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,039
um for me what i would do is to kind of

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,960
take a look and start

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,080
start with three questions to ask

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,919
yourself right

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,919
um what do you know what do you enjoy

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,559
and how would hacking fit into that so

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,240
again

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,039
one of the best examples i think is is

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,159
kind of the web developer thing and

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,840
um you know i'm a web developer

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,280
or let's pretend i'm a web developer i'm

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
not um

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
and okay so that's my skill set right i

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
know maybe i'm a back-end developer or

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
maybe i'm a front-end developer

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
it doesn't really matter um

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,840
so i probably already know some ways to

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,200
break things

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
in ways that they shouldn't you know

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
make things work in ways that they

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
shouldn't or

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,200
to make things that shouldn't happen

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,159
happen um so you're already kind of part

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
way there

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,960
um is that something that you think is

00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,600
super fun it doesn't mean you really

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
enjoy

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,679
um kind of making things work in ways

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,320
other than how they were intended

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,760
um well then maybe that's maybe that's a

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,159
good way to kind of

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,919
mesh these two things maybe a web

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,320
application pen testing career would be

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,159
great for you

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,520
obviously a web developer career could

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,880
be great for you too but

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,120
you know just kind of something to think

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,559
about

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,039
and so for example right let's say

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,840
tying in this this puzzle solving thing

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,640
um so

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,000
you know you're let's say we're not web

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,880
developers maybe we're kind of

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,480
end users um but but we use a lot of

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,919
websites because well let's be real

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
everybody does

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
so um maybe you know a little bit you

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,559
kind of twitter around you're like

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,000
alright html maybe a little bit of

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,640
javascript okay i can like

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,760
set a variable or i can do like you know

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,679
a little bit of kind of

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
building something in javascript and but

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,240
i i really enjoy like kind of puzzle

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,840
solving and

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,919
so i guess then the question might be

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,279
to kind of put these three together into

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,960
one might be

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,720
how do i get access to something that i

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,720
shouldn't be able to get to

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
and then of course the context of in a

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,640
safe and legal environment

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,480
um well we'll take a look so

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
a safe and legal environment for this

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
kind of thing and i do have to give a

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,039
big shout out last year i

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,440
actually attended a training on this um

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,480
bill seth and uh brian king so bill

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,919
samphou um

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
i forgot who he works for but he does

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,279
the oauth chapter here in columbus he's

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,880
big in that

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,440
um brian king is a

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
pentester who uh he works for black

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,200
hills information security

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,400
which i have a lot of uh and the

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
acknowledgements here at the end a lot

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
of this is owed to them

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,200
so um you could set up an instance of

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,360
juice shop it's really easy

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
you basically just set up you set up

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,279
node

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,799
and then you do you know you download

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,360
shop the um the tar gz file

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,320
and then you expand it and then you just

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,000
npm start

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
and there you go like port 3000 on

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
whatever that system is

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,480
um you're running g-shock now so it's

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
pretty simple there's also docker and

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
stuff like that

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,600
so you know whatever kind of floats your

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,679
boat in that space

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,279
so start up firefox and then there's a

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,279
tutorial and it's great

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,720
um and you can kind of start through and

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,120
start going through things a lot of the

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,600
the things in there have

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,360
some really cool things where i'm going

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,559
to try to go into that a little bit here

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,559
today

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,679
but the next thing that's important is

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,520
kind of sharing that experience with

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,240
people like i had so much fun doing this

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,720
thanks to um the folks that work on this

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,159
and

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,919
um there's announcements on that as well

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,880
so

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,279
so really quick um i do want to kind of

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
touch

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,840
on i want to do a little demo um for

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
anybody who ever watches information

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,000
security things there's something of a

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,480
curse

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,320
in live demos but i i'm not

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,600
superstitious

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,039
so famous last words um so kind of what

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
i mentioned before right

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
so we have um hopefully everybody can

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
see this okay

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
um so i'm in a directory here this is

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,720
just a debian box i set up for this

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,640
purpose

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,760
um so i'm gonna just do

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,240
i'm gonna just extract it

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,159
just take a second i've already set up

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,279
node because that's kind of um

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,600
not too challenging um and you know it's

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,880
kinda

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,720
i gotta give you something to aim for

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
right so i'm in the

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,400
g-shop folder now let me just do npm

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,520
start

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,480
and we'll just give that a moment so

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
there we go

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,320
so now port 3000 is available server

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,120
listening on port 3000 so now

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,080
it's running and and you know other than

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,279
downloading it with

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,279
you know wget um

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,520
that's about the it's about the most

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
challenging thing so

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,720
um this guy's running now so i'm gonna

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,120
jump over

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
um and i just i want to talk i probably

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
should have done this first but i wanted

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,520
to talk about

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,440
the osprey owasp is the open web

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,400
application security project

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,400
um they're pretty incredible they do a

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,880
lot of amazing things

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,159
i've so many resources so many like

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
hours spent going through

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,640
some of their stuff including this if

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
you just go to owasp.org and

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
projects and then juice shop that's

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,039
where it is currently

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,320
um and this is going to take you to the

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,840
to their page on this topic um

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,880
really pretty straightforward right

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,919
there's installation over here you can

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,679
do it from source you can get the

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,159
packages from github you can do a docker

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,720
image

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
it's pretty straightforward um but you

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,399
come here

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,320
right and then we're gonna look at the

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,399
tutorial section and this is going to

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,520
kind of get you started

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,440
so if i want to get to

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,480
this get to this site

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,039
um so

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,880
this oops sorry 3 000.

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,200
so this is the juice shop site so this

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,039
is running um this is my local you know

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
the vm that i set up

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,120
um and this is kind of you know it's

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,640
just it's emulating kind of a

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,279
you know javascript based uh web store

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,159
so it's pretty straightforward it's

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,799
really cool

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,720
um and and when you set it up and

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,679
actually worth noting too there's also a

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,120
demo instance

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,039
um i should have probably mentioned this

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,679
before too this is a place where

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,039
you know you can go it's specifically

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,039
challenge that's their public

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,559
instance so you can go to this website

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,600
right now you don't have to set anything

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,360
up yourself

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,960
you can go to demo.osp-juice.shop

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,480
and then you can kind of get running and

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
test things out in that

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,320
environment which i think is just cool

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
that they just have it in a place where

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,399
it's like yeah go go try this out see

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,399
what happens

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,919
um all right so if we look at the juice

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,559
shop there's a number of different

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
things

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,360
and i'm not going to go into detail

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,200
about how everything works i'm going to

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,440
do just a couple of quick demos and then

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,360
i'm going to move on because i need to

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,360
talk about other things

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,679
um so the first thing right is our

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,799
scoreboard and the cool thing about this

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,520
if you click on it

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,200
it'll take you to a tutorial and you'll

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,480
have this little blue guy up here

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,679
that'll take you through the whole

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,799
process

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,000
um i'm gonna just kind of do a little

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,440
bit differently

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,140
um finding the scoreboard is a matter of

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
looking at um our

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,679
[Music]

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
code so if we do f12 probably people

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,080
know this right f12 is our

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,000
developer mode i'm not sure if that key

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,720
binding is the same across all platforms

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
but

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,960
um that'll get you there and then down

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,240
here there's a um

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,240
there's a button for to kind of

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,480
print your pretty source file so this is

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
like all the source that's minified

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,200
for people who don't know what that is

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,520
it's basically compressed so they remove

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
any

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,159
unnecessary spaces or new lines um

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
and then you can click this little

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
button down here that will change it to

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,720
print it in kind of a pretty format

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,080
so that way you can kind of see what's

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,919
going on and

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
the easiest thing is just start looking

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,520
for what we're looking for

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,520
so scoreboard okay so

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
this dot challenges okay so that's

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
probably in relation to their stuff

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,120
i know it's not going to really

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,320
necessarily all come through on zoom

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,120
so i'm going to kind of just jump

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,919
forward if you search a few times

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,440
i think maybe i go down to score and

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,559
then well that's interesting so here's

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
just like slash

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,799
score dash board so i don't know maybe

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,919
maybe that'll be it

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,840
um and if we just push that in then

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,240
i'm sorry i did this backwards we need

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
the uh

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
here we go okay so this is the curse

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,640
where my

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
fingers give out on me that's how i'm

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,039
going to be cursed today and i can't

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,399
type anything

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,760
so this will get you to the scoreboard

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,399
right and i know i'm giving away a

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
little bit

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,480
right it's a little tiny bit on this one

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
but um this is a really cool place that

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,559
they've kind of gamified all this

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,520
in such an incredibly cool way um

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,640
because now

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
they're saying okay here's our

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,159
difficulty levels so these are kind of

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,440
the one star so if you've never done

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,039
anything like this you can just start

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,640
with these one star

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,039
and just kind of go through and figure

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,039
out how to do stuff

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,159
um one of the easiest ones that i think

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,279
is pretty fun

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,919
um so a dom uh xss or crops

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,039
cross site scripting attack so this

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,480
one's pretty cool

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,080
um the gist of it is to kind of get the

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,519
page to

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,960
to load with this information in it um

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,640
and you so the easiest way for this one

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,240
what you're looking for is like a text

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
box um

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,600
to kind of put something into so easiest

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,360
one where you go up to search there's a

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,159
search box right there if we just take

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
that

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
and you know don't copy paste code but

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,360
also we can read it and see what it says

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,200
um and my fingers will definitely not

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,600
type that correctly right now

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,360
um so there we go so we got the xss

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,240
pop-up and then we get these messages

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
saying you did it

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,039
great job now if we go back to

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,799
the scoreboard

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,080
um we'll see that this has been solved

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,559
so this is green so

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,000
that's pretty cool um really quick

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,720
last thing that i think i'm gonna go

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,320
through today is uh sql injection

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,080
and i'm doing this because hopefully

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,880
david stokes is still watching because

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,559
i'm sure that

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,399
um he probably loves this one

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,480
this isn't a sql issue it's a it's an

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,159
input validation issue

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,840
but if we this is actually a two-star

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,880
one so it is a little bit more

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,799
challenging

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,159
um but we'll do this and then we'll go

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,080
to we'll hide

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,000
all of them and feminine into injection

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,080
right so now we're only showing two

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,519
stars that relate to injection

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,360
so log in with the administrators

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,679
account

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,919
so really cool stuff right if you click

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,679
on this little kind of graduate hat here

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,120
then it'll take you to

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,320
an interactive tutorial like the one

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,519
that showed up before where it has a

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,960
little pop-up that says

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,880
this is what we're doing go click this

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,200
button or

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,200
this guy right here will take you to

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,039
part their page

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,559
which you know you can see pwning.org

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,080
you know this is their website here's

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,320
injection um

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,159
log with the administrators account now

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,600
for anybody who knows anything about sql

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,080
injection you know this is a very

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,080
old thing um unfortunately it still

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,159
happens

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,679
so it's a vulnerability it's been around

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,240
for a long time but if people are not

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,960
careful

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,960
it can still happen

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,480
so um this gives you kind of a little

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,600
bit more

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,200
on the hint side on what you want to do

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,880
so for this one the gist of it is

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,760
what happens is the website takes

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,760
a query it takes information that you

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,480
type in and it merges that into a query

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,480
and then it

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,159
it sends that to the sql server and then

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,440
whatever comes back

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,120
um so

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,720
it will let's let's jump forward here so

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,000
um if we go into the login field

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,960
right so we're going to try to craft a

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,240
uh

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,120
craft something here and so really

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,279
quickly we're going to

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,240
terminate the sql query because a lot of

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,679
times they'll end with it'll be a

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
parenthesis or a quote or something like

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,960
that

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,079
and we're going to do or one equals one

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,839
and then we're going to drop it to a

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,399
comment so that everything comes after

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,520
it

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,359
is commented so if

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,280
people don't validate input then

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,639
basically this is directly modifying the

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,520
sql query

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,560
and then because we have to have

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,599
something in the password we'll just

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,599
punch a letter in there it doesn't

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,280
matter what you put in

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,599
so again we're terminating the sql query

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,119
and then we are um

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,200
dropping to comments evan yeah the the

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,639
voice is speaking to you from behind the

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,520
curtains saying that you have five

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
minutes left and

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,919
questions for you okay perfect just

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,040
letting you know

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,000
so all right i just kind of got that uh

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,280
notification there so

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,679
all right um

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,200
so anyway so we logged in there here's

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,159
our uh here's our account we're logged

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,119
in as the uh

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,920
the admin now because depending on how

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,720
things are set up

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,960
user zero is probably the admin so if as

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,680
i

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,640
as i remember if no z if or the first

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,400
row in the table

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,800
is the admin generally speaking so if no

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,320
user specified it just goes with that

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,079
um so you don't even have to know

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
anything about the admin if the sql

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,119
injection is there so

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
sorry i'm running out of time so we're

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
going to jump forward

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,599
right so some next steps important

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,520
things making an account

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,880
um get you know you can do when you when

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,320
you practice you know you can get a bug

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
crowd hack or one account

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,560
find somebody to kind of mentor and or

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,760
train you um portswigger's company they

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,640
make a really cool tool called burp

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
suite and it's

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,920
they have some really cool stuff on

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,920
there

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
um a company called offensive security

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,359
who does kali linux they um

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,640
and they're great they do a bunch of

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
other stuff they have a certification

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,400
for this

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
you know practice maybe get assert and

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,960
then you can start looking at a job

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,839
um and or pushing in in your your

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,320
environment

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,839
to kind of spend more time into the

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,640
space you can get that practical

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,920
experience

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,560
sorry i'm really bad at keeping time so

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,680
so some other stuff on the windows side

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,359
super quick

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
you know build a lab domain set up a vm

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,200
with cali um black holes information

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,320
security i mentioned them before

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,760
um and they they have some amazing

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
videos on youtube

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,880
the amount of information they give away

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,720
for free on there is incredible

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,400
um cyber mentor is another person has a

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
lot of good info start looking at some

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,720
certs and

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,800
and then start looking at a job so

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,160
if we want to generalize that decide the

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
thing that you want to learn

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,480
create or find a safe space to to learn

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,560
that thing

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,760
find a resource that can teach you the

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,920
thing

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
invest your time and effort in learning

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,599
the thing and and

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,040
consider certifications they're not 100

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,240
required but um

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,079
you want to have some way to demonstrate

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,839
that you learned it and then

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,000
find out how to get paid so find that

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,920
job that will that will teach you

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,760
um so oh boy i'm so far behind now uh so

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
my path right telephone technical

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,640
support i mentioned it i went from that

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,839
up to uh help desk it operations worked

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,359
at the company called rex squared here

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,760
in columbus for a little bit

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,520
back to microelectronics um junior and

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,960
then regular system administrator there

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
microelectronics again parent company

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,320
for micro center

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,920
then i went to top performance usa

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,599
enterprise linux engineer admin engineer

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,119
and i came over to blogs compliance

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,079
started on the kind of blue team the

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,680
defensive side

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,320
doing security analysts and then moved

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,520
over to the offensive side

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,520
so these resources um pretty

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,040
pretty cool stuff get some screen grabs

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,599
here because i don't have time to go

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,280
through each of these individually

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,960
but couple good youtube channels some

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,720
web resources some active learning

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,240
resources some stuff that black hills

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,520
they have a cyber range there's a site

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,320
called hack the box that's a bunch of

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,480
cool

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,680
um things uh you know virtual machine

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,400
setup you can hack into

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,920
stuff like that um juice shop obviously

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,000
some other technical resources there

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,839
and i don't necessarily unfortunately

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,200
have time to really talk about these

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,240
i'm sure that hopefully some of the

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,440
questions are really interesting and

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,800
i'll stick around in slack

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,920
to answer as many as i can um as well

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,119
there

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,800

do we have time do we have time for the

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,920
zoom question

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,480
man no dude i love this i i worked at

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,480
deja vu security and leviathan and i ran

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,079
2600 group and like everything you're

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,560
saying speaks to me so much

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,760
um so yeah is it cool to run through the

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,079
zoom question or

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,800
is our next speaker ready to go i think

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,079
we

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,920
can't do the one but that's always yeah

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,000
so uh if you wouldn't mind hanging out

00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,440
in slack afterwards i'll post some of

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,760
the other questions we have but the

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,920
zoom question right now is by uh

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,640
jonathan i've worked on pen testing in

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,800
my past

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240
jobs after i do the juice bar website

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,920
test what should i do next

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,839
i'm looking for my next career yeah that

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,640
was a lot of your slides in the end

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,839
there

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,160
yeah i know so the big thing is right

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,400
you

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,520
you find the thing you learn it and then

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,760
you figure out kind of

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,359
how you can start getting paid i for me

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,200
i got really lucky because i had

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,800
you know it was a physic it was

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,480
something that my company was doing and

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
were expanding into that space and now

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
i'm

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,640
kind of not fully in charge but

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
partially in charge of it

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,359
um and so learn it

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,440
the cert would probably be the next

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,000
thing so the awe advanced web attacks

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,560
and

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,079
exploits certification would be a really

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,560
cool way to go with that

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,160
um you can learn a lot in that space and

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,200
i've gone through the

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,720
training i haven't taken the test but i

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,359
did a lot of the training

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,440
and it's it's pretty amazing i empathize

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,040
with your reinstallation of grub man

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,880
that was the first thing

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,000
right out of the jump that you mentioned

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,839
i was like yep

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,839
i've been there yeah

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,880
right i know it was it made the family

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,079
sad because it was broken for a few days

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,480
before i could figure it out

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,800
uh and eventually i just ended up uh

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,960
reinstalling the windows bootloader

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,560
linux plays nice with windows windows

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,200
doesn't always play nice with linux i

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,040
found out

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,800
and it will eat your bootloader every

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,960
single time oh yeah

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,240
thank you so much i super appreciate you

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
coming on i'm gonna put some of the

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,599
stuff in slack there for you so you

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,680
hopefully you can answer them

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,200
cool thanks everybody i will talk to

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,200
