Description: 
	Speakers: Nathan Case and Andrew J Krug
Kaminsky said it best at BlackHat 2017 when he uttered the words “We don’t compete on security”. A call to action for open-sourcerers to develop security tools and share the secrets to their technology strategies to defend. Contribution though is not just code. Companies the world over should be thinking about their people and process. In this talk we’ll explore what makes an open source security strategy valuable to you and the world.
As a creator/contributor to popular open source tools ( Margaritashotgun and AWS IR ) Krug and Case ( the speakers ) will bring some pragmatic advice to new tool creators as well as a call to action to create and distribute re-usable code. The future of open source is one that embraces building cloud and leveraging cloud native technologies to protect our users.
Assumptions, data collection, and product market fit are often overlooked though when it comes to communicating how tooling should be published, curated, and maintained. Attendees will leave with practical advice on the full open source security lifecycle.
