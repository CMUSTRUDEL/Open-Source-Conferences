Title: [OLF 2020] We Don’t Compete on Security
Publication date: 2020-12-14
Playlist: 2020 Videos
Description: 
	Speakers: Nathan Case and Andrew J Krug
Kaminsky said it best at BlackHat 2017 when he uttered the words “We don’t compete on security”. A call to action for open-sourcerers to develop security tools and share the secrets to their technology strategies to defend. Contribution though is not just code. Companies the world over should be thinking about their people and process. In this talk we’ll explore what makes an open source security strategy valuable to you and the world.
As a creator/contributor to popular open source tools ( Margaritashotgun and AWS IR ) Krug and Case ( the speakers ) will bring some pragmatic advice to new tool creators as well as a call to action to create and distribute re-usable code. The future of open source is one that embraces building cloud and leveraging cloud native technologies to protect our users.
Assumptions, data collection, and product market fit are often overlooked though when it comes to communicating how tooling should be published, curated, and maintained. Attendees will leave with practical advice on the full open source security lifecycle.

welcome to

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,320
we don't compete on security you are at

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,639
the ohio

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
ohio of course linux foundation

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,440
conference virtually

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,440
because this is 2020 after all

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,359
and uh you know we are people so you

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,960
might hear a dog bark or

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,880
a door shut because we are at home

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
for all i know there could be a house

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
re-roofing right now

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,000
i'm andrew krug i'm a security geek at

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,480
datadog and this is my good friend

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
nathan

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,239
do you want to go ahead and introduce

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,840
yourself nathan hi i'm nathan i am a

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
security geek at aws

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
we thought it'd be fun today to walk you

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
through the topic of open sourcing your

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,559
security efforts

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
and challenge some of your base

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,680
assumptions about whether or not there

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,199
are some things in your work that might

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,879
be able to move

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,120
from your current workflow perhaps out

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,079
of the basement somewhere into the open

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
we're going to talk through the

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,239
different business reasons that you

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
might just

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
consider doing this crazy thing we like

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,920
to call open source

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
and we'll look at examples of some

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,000
projects that have worked out well

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,600
and what the attributes of those are and

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,040
at the very end of this call

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,360
we will have a call to action

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
which is a way that you can get involved

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
with an

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,439
open source initiative that the two of

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
us are working on right now

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,439
in a nutshell that means that you should

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
walk away with an idea of how to start

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,280
that conversation at your business

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
an understanding of some of the concerns

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,439
and issues around open source

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
and be given a link to a little survey

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,960
right at the end that you can do for

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,759
some follow-up after the con

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
we'll have a white paper a webinar etc

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
because we like takeaways

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
right nathan we love takeaways it's

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
unfortunate that today we're not going

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280
to be able to give you as many takeaways

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
as we normally do

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,479
which brings us to our fair warning that

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
this is a thought leadery talk

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,000
and you may or may not like thought

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
leader e talks and you may love

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,960
our fun demos that we generally do in

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,600
our presentations at reinvent

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
but we want to see your fun demos as a

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
result

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
of this 30 minute presentation we want

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
to see those out in the world and your

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,319
fun security tools

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
if you've never seen us talk before and

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
you're looking for demos

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
quite possibly the best place to look is

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
some of the old talks that nathan and i

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,760
have collaborated on together

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
we've been geeking out on security stuff

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
since 2016

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
all over the place trying to think of

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,120
new ways to solve interesting and fun

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,959
problems with a bunch of folks as well

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,360
if you look really closely you can see

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,640
us there at reinforced 2019

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,959
doing a workshop on an open source sim

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,480
and uh that was a great workshop a lot

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
all these are still available out there

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
on the web

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,280
but we've launched a lot of tools we

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
taught a lot of folks along the way

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
and we've had some great things that

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,200
came out of those talks it wasn't just

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,519
talks we delivered there have been

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
another number of white papers tools and

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
other work

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,519
that kind of came out of this collab

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,959
together all in the name of

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,720
this thing we call open source security

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
you really like the fargate ir one

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
frankly my personal fave

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
but yeah okay yeah fargate ir was a good

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
talk diy my guide to run books playbooks

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,560
and incident response

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
i look back on that fondly when i think

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,879
of in-person events

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,720
so some people might say that as a

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
result of this i've been heavily open

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,040
source influenced

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,159
but i actually think that's understated

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
i'm open source

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,959
infected and that might be a bit of a

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,519
charge term in 2020

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
but i spent three years as a mosilian i

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,400
did a tour

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,879
at the only place i think you can work

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,360
in the world that is open by default

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,959
and open by design and now when i can't

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
do that kind of work it just really gets

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
at me and when i see

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
other people missing opportunities to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,799
share their work with others

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,080
it really gets to me so i hope by the

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,319
end of this talk that we can

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
infect you with a little bit of open

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,879
source in a good way

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
in a good way and you'll be inspired to

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,480
open source

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
something of your own so why would you

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
consider building

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
a strategy on open source to run your

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,640
security program

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
it's crazy right like generally when we

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,599
think of security we think of things

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,160
that we hide as a means of kind of

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,720
evading attacks

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
but you know there are advantages to

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
doing this

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
open source thing but before we can talk

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,759
about that

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,080
we need to think for a minute about like

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,080
the benefits of open sourcing something

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
and the concerns around that and also

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,639
challenge the idea

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:42,160
that open source is only code right so

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,120
that brings us to this paper uh mozilla

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,800
framework for purposeful open source it

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
came out in 2018

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
a mozilla fellow by the name of patrick

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
finch

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
did a study to try and categorize the

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,919
different considerations around

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,520
different types of open source projects

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,280
this very cool study i suggest that you

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
take some time to give it a read

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,560
if you were going to kick off an open

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
source effort

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
but we'll kind of give you the the

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,600
bullet points here

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,880
basically patrick went and took the time

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,800
to identify these buckets on screen here

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,000
as some of the most common among all the

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,440
projects that

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,280
he looked at and he created an index of

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
considerations around the curation of

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
these projects

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
and why an individual or a company would

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
want

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,400
to even consider open sourcing

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
in security we see a lot of variety

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,280
across these various

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
archetypical models and the trade-offs

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
are just something that you need to be

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
aware of when you're evaluating the

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
reason that something is open

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
before trying to use it in your security

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,560
program

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,160
so if you look at these there's there's

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
things like b2b wide open

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
trusted vendor specialty library

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,919
controlled ecosystem

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,680
all of these different motivations and

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,440
we all know that we're we're sort of

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,360
yearning for the wide open but the real

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
reasons that that companies are involved

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,919
in open source very

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,440
greatly and we don't need to necessarily

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,360
preach to this community of course

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
because this is after all a linux

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
foundation

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,440
conference well let's look at a few of

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
these motivations

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,440
like these three archetypes here i think

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,720
are are fairly prominent in security

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,000
software

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,000
mostly because from a business

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
perspective they're an easy sell

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
in order to get maintainers and

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
community curation

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
the business to business of course we're

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
trying to onboard people

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,880
to our technology controlled ecosystem

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
something like a kubernetes

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
or specialty library something that

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
solves a a very specific problem in a

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
very specific way

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,600
that a large community has like rust

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,680
rust solves a significant problem for

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,039
example for a very large community

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
but we still want this wide open

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,440
archetype we want this kind of

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,520
the perfect future which is the dream

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,599
right we have large-scale collaboration

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,599
a self-sustaining community and it

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,000
scales by users helping users

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
instead of a large corporate structure

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,440
kind of coming in

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,440
and curating these projects

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
andrew and i do a lot of incident

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
responses you talked a lot about

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,960
incident response in the past and

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,639
because of that when we look at

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
wide-open things sometimes it can get a

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
little awkward for folks

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
especially in the large enterprises or

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,199
in large businesses where you have a

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,199
maybe a ciso that isn't necessarily

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,319
accustomed to looking at an open source

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
project

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
but specifically when we get into

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,759
security libraries

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
to wide open i would urge you to think

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
about the concepts of encryption

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,440
the reality is that when you look at an

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
encryption algorithm it's really not

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,319
tested until you've made it open and

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
everybody gets to take a look at it and

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
evaluate whether you made any mistakes

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
so in this scenario we're going to talk

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
about some strategies that help you

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
understand

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
where that open source product fits or

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,400
can fit inside of your

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,160
strategy and also why it makes it better

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,599
yeah and the assertion would be here

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
that that this community

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,520
really needs more wide open projects in

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
the ecosystem and not just software once

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
again like we're not just talking about

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
software we're talking about

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,759
anything that you can curate that solves

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
a problem

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,280
fills a need and you can build a

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
community around you can start small you

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,759
can start in one of these archetypes

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
and you can move to another but the

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
point is

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,400
you need to to do a good job engaging

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
with that community in order to kind of

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
leverage

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,319
this thing that we call open source

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,240
and you might be asking why you should

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,279
do this why

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,399
would you why would you open source a

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,159
specific

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,000
tool or framework etc in 2016

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,080
i had the pleasure of watching dan

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,279
kaminsky keynote black hat and he told

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,200
this story

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
about a bunch of banks sitting down and

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,240
sharing their security strategies in the

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
open with one another

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,600
because it was mutually beneficial the

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
answer is it is

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,360
mutually beneficial for you to share

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
your security secrets

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
with other people in your industry

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
because then you just get to compete on

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
features

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,680
you get to build customer confidence in

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,279
your your fellow technology partners and

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,920
in your industry

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,880
and security is in a lever to encourage

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
clients to move

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
over to you and that one statement it

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
stuck with me

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,959
over the years which is we don't compete

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,480
on security

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
and honestly if you think you don't have

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,320
anything that you can open source from

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
your security program i assure you that

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
you do

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,040
even if you don't have an army of

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,160
security engineers writing code

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
all day long you can open source all

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
kinds of things

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
frameworks run books job family

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
architectures

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
like you can even open source a doc

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,760
template and that's going to bring

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
somebody some value on it like

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,000
quite honestly the the mozilla incident

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,120
response template i still refer

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,360
people back to all the time because it's

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
one of the only publicly available ir

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
templates that's out there

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
well and right now for instance i'm

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,920
actually working on an organizational

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,440
structure that's going to be

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
open sourced and so as that

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,720
organizational structure gets out there

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
people actually start using it

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
we intend to increase an organization's

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,160
security by helping them respond and

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,360
deal with security

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
in a different way because they're

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
structured a different way how does that

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,000
change the way you do your processes how

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
does that change

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
the way you respond to incidents how

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,320
does that change the way you build your

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,519
run books and playbooks andrew and i

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
have done a number of talks around

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
building

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
good run books and playbooks but what

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,839
does that mean specifically to you

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,959
and i got news for you there are still a

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
lot of people out there that don't do

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
that it would be really helpful for

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,680
everybody else if you have a good run

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,959
book or playbook or you think it's

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
really solid and you're really happy

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
with it

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,560
open source it take a look at it

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
and this at the end of the day it's an

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
acknowledgement that we all have a

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,640
common set of problems to solve right

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
like regardless of your size or scale if

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,680
you're a new startup company that's just

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
walking

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
walking in today like you just get

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,959
started

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,640
you're gonna have the same problems as a

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,560
startup two years ago

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
plus a few others but everybody's

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
starting from scratch right like how

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,640
many times we made

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,200
a cloud security organization chart

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
or created a cloud security roadmap for

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,959
a brand new piece of software

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,800
from scratch like totally from scratch

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,920
how many times have have those very very

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,519
similar words been written down

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,079
or a chat client or a messaging service

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
yeah

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,160
messaging services and that's a great

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,560
segue into our next point

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,399
which is that there is one more slightly

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,800
more dangerous archetype right

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
and that is this one that my good friend

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,279
patrick finch likes to call the

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,160
bathwater

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,040
open source archetype from uh that 2018

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
study

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,720
and it's the idea that you just dump

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,399
something on github

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
just to distribute it and then you never

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
check back in on it you don't curate the

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,519
issues you don't respond to people you

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,680
never improve it

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
well we had a phrase for that before it

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
was called open source it was just

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
called

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,600
publishing and publishing has a value

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,639
don't get me wrong but the value

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
of open source is in the evolution of

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,800
your contribution

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,320
not specifically the act of publishing

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,639
all by itself

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,560
so nathan as a uh as a security expert

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,279
how do we start building an awesome

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,639
security program using open source

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
what do you think are some of the key

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,519
pieces and parts we might consider if i

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,480
were say

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,040
a cso kicking off a new program at a new

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
startup

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,399
or an existing company more terrifyingly

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,519
let's say that that company is running

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,519
running cloud

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,279
in in 2020 which i would think would be

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,000
an advantage right because we can do

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,360
things so much

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,040
faster with cloud

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
so i i would tell you that i think that

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,240
it is and it isn't when we

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,720
look at security strategies in general

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
the one thing that i as the advisor

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
when i walk in and talk to a cso don't

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,959
want to see is a product list

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
the goal for a strategy isn't to have a

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,680
list of open source projects that you're

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
going to contribute to

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,959
or work on that's great don't get me

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,880
wrong i'm happy that you're doing that

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,639
we are all happy that you're doing that

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,839
the intent is though that you get

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,839
something out of it

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
so when we look at things we want to

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,160
make sure that you have both things that

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
you can be

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
that we can quantify things that will

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
actually add up that you can say hey

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,680
look

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
we've made this many changes to the code

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,079
and it's gotten this much better or we

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
have this many features

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
we wanted to implement and they've

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
gotten better when we talk about risk

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,360
compliance and governance

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
near and dear to my heart as an incident

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
responder

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
how many of those governance policies

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
have you actually open sourced have you

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,240
open sourced any of those things and

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
could those

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,160
policies actually then incorporate into

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
another open source project and make

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
that project better

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
now as we look at your strategy right

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,440
you're going to say something like

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,959
i would very much like to have all of my

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
compliance

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,720
checked on a daily basis and evaluate

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
whether or not my governance standards

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,600
have been followed all year long and i

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
want to be able to know that when

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
something happens

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
it will be remediated that's a great

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
statement i'm really happy with that

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
action statement that makes me feel good

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,639
i know there's a business case behind it

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
not going to get into building business

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
cases obviously everything ends in money

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,399
but the reality here is that we have to

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
make the world a better place so

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
one of the things we also need to think

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,560
about as we contribute to an open source

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
project

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
is how are we training our people what

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,440
kind of things do we get out of that

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,040
what are the things that are maybe

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,560
non-non-quantifiable or non-tactile

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,320
well the nice part about open source is

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,519
we have a lot of code we have a lot of

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
things that people need to write and

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
change and do so

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,000
now we have the things like governance

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
and strategy we have

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
feature sets we have things that you

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
need specifically to do user stories

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,160
business cases

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
then we have your team actually working

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
on the training and the awareness of

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
those pieces so it's kind of a holistic

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
thing

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
and here's the great part when my

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
company does that and andrew's company

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,760
does that

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,839
the world gets to be a better place

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
and you know we don't have time to dive

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,560
deep into those business cases

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,079
today in this 30 minute presentation but

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,920
let's just talk a little bit about this

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,800
idea of open eye design right so you

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,320
kind of talked

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,160
a little bit about this at the beginning

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,360
of of uh

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,680
your your advice here which was

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
that maybe there is some some uh

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
policies or governance or

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
or papers that people aren't open

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
sourcing oftentimes

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,560
i don't know about you but i just have

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
this opinion that when

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,560
somebody starts with this idea that a

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,720
thing is open by design

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,240
it's higher quality because they know

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,519
that they're preparing to share it

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
it's different when you know everybody's

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,279
going to take a look at it isn't it yes

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,240
when you start with this at the outset

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,759
the building things in a way that has a

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,720
common language that you can really

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,320
level set with

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,079
your community on that you know that

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,519
you're going to put out in front

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
of additional eyes you inherently make

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,240
that

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,519
more accessible and by virtue that it's

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,680
higher quality

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,199
i agree and i think as we look at the

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
strategy and begin to include those

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
pieces

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,000
into our strategy things begin to solid

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,000
up so if we look at the next slide

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
we see things like well how am i going

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
to do this well i need to consider

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
things like my sunk cost i need to

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,920
understand

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
what my people need to be trained on so

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,240
as we start looking at the actual

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,759
physical things that go

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,320
into that business case that help us

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,480
define which open source project we're

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,320
going to invest in as our enterprise now

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
let's pretend that andrew and i are

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,399
in an enterprise together i need to make

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,000
sure that our enterprise contributes to

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
this thing and makes a difference we

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,199
want to make it better

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
absolutely i need to understand how it's

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,320
going to make me better too so

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,600
as as i don't know as onerous as i

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
suppose it is we have to deal with the

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,720
fact that it really is all about the

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,079
money in some cases to an enterprise

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
we have to make sure that we understand

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,800
where the money's going and in this case

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
we're actually making

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,079
kind of that cool moment where where

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,160
we've

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,639
injected something into a community

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,399
we've helped that community get better

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,880
we've gone ahead and trained our people

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,399
so that we are better

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,560
and things are good the things we need

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,560
to avoid however are things like

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
a developer coming up and saying hey

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
let's do this cool new thing

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
it's going to be really hard for you as

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,319
the cso2 defend your choice to

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,880
include rust into your strategy this

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
year if

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
the best argument you have for it is

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,120
it's cool or

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
hey by the way it fits in this framework

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,039
totally

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,120
totally cool that it fits in your

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,480
framework but as the business owner i

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,199
need to know what your business case is

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
for it

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
and there are plenty of ways to do that

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
so make sure that you put the the

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
numbers to the problem

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
yeah i think this is a an area where

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,039
open source can really help like if we

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
just go back to the rest

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,799
example like how many things if you have

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
a brand new startup company

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,919
can you take out of your sec pipeline

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,679
because you're building on something

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,240
like russ where russ is

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
built to be inherently safe from the

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,080
ground up the compiler literally just

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,240
can't build things that aren't

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,600
operationally safe from a memory

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,960
perspective from a type safety

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,440
perspective they make it

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
very very very hard to pursue

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
anti-patterns

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,120
and so how quantifiable it i can prove

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,640
to you it's safe

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,280
that's awesome yes provable with math

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
uh and that saves time it saves money

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
and it makes your users safer right so

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
this is like

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
a great example of where open source is

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
kind of coming in and being a hero

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
because i don't know about you i've

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
never worked at a place that just said

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
boy we just have

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,760
so much money to spend on security stuff

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
this year

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,559
we're literally we're just looking for

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,559
ways to spend money

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
and i guarantee you the cfo will look at

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
you as the cso if you come in with a

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
business plan that includes those

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
numbers and say hey by the way we're

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
going to save x amounts of millions this

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
year because we've done open source the

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,160
right way

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,919
that's that's a beautiful day speaking

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,360
of doing it the right way

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,400
there is some some good prior work here

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,280
one of my uh former uh bosses

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,880
actually did uh this study in 2018 jeff

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
breiner

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,880
on open source security solutions and

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,320
how prominent they were in security

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
and if they were actually really solving

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,400
problems we put out a little survey for

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,000
uh security besides portland which is

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
a great besides by the way if you've

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,840
never been to security b sides portland

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
happens every october

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,880
um and the video is available here but

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
just

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,000
to kind of run through the highlights

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,559
most people

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
were actually using open source software

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,520
in their security program

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
and i would even challenge the people

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,559
that said that they weren't that maybe

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,039
they just didn't know that they're using

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,600
an oss product in their security program

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,360
like have you ever used nmap or do you

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,000
use a vulnerability scanner

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
or do you use something like os query

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,679
which are all great projects

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,240
that are at the heart of some commercial

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,240
solutions

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,840
so two significant numbers from that

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
survey really stood out to me which is

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,760
the

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,080
52 number and the 66 number

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,039
where at least 52 percent of people

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
admitted

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,400
openly that they were using open source

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
in their security effort

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
which is totally great slightly over

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,080
half of respondents and like i said i

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
think that's probably skewed

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,120
a little bit low based on uh knowledge

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,400
of underlying products

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,600
but 66 of those folks cited a lack of

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
curation

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,679
and good support as the most major

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,039
barrier to adoption and usage

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
and this is the thing that's preventing

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,880
us from getting to that ideal

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
wide open kind of future

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
so if curation and support are a

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
challenge let's take a peek at three

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,840
projects that are doing an

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
excellent job of community curation and

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
also have a great product market fit

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
and of course we're going to pick on

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,960
cloud projects because that's kind of

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,960
mine and nathan's bread and butter

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
and i think primarily we're gonna well

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
first anyway we'll pick on prowler

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
um so tony's a friend i'll be very

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,400
honest uh

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
wonderful person like to work with him

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
and prowler is a great way for us to go

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,200
ahead

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,640
and evaluate environments to to decide

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,520
whether or not those environments are

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
actually

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
appropriate and where we expect them to

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,360
be with some some really nice baselines

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,559
um tony myself and another and a friend

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,720
of ours actually wrote a really nice

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,640
blog about this earlier this year

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,679
uh we walked through how to do it in aws

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,360
and actually even gave you some

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
demonstration code as to how you need to

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,320
get it done and how to even inject that

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,200
into security hope if that's what you

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,559
want to do or

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
frankly to inject it into whatever

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
assume you want to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,280
and this is a great example of the

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,559
specialty library case right because

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,640
it's totally a

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,159
it's a purpose purpose-built tool that

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
really solves a problem

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,280
like somebody somebody saw a problem in

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
the community and they just said i'm

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,320
gonna solve that

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,760
with automation and tooling that doesn't

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
exist

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,159
and that that is very cool and then

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,559
there's this project scout suite

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
like tell us tell us a bit more about uh

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,480
scout suite i think it's one of the

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,679
older

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
cloud auditing tools out there yeah well

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
i can't say that i know a red team that

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,480
doesn't use scout suite at some point in

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
their red team review or their pen

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,280
testing review

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,559
so i mean it's kind of one of those

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,960
bread and butter items again

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,159
that that we will use for an audit or a

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,000
review of an account that

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,720
we frankly may not know anything about

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,919
so if andrew paid me to come and pen

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
test his stuff

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,799
i'm probably running prowler i'm

00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,679
probably running scout suite against it

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
to evaluate

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,200
how that that whole system sits together

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,760
and and whether there's some basic stuff

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
that needs to be

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
corrected

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,400
and then that brings us to one of my

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
personal favorites cloud mapper so when

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,840
i go out and i do an audit

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,000
i love to use this tool cloud mapper

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,120
which came out of duo labs

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,960
and this is one of the the cases where

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
a corporation kind of is curating the

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
project right

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
but there's a huge community of people

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
who are active maintainers

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
kind of around this and when i say huge

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,080
i generally mean greater than one

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,320
because it's very hard to find folks who

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,000
are are willing to step up

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,400
and do this level of maintenance but

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,080
oftentimes as a user of this tool

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
i receive better support than i received

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
for many commercial projects

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,360
well weren't you telling me he responded

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,280
to you in like two hours at one point

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
yeah uh the the support for the pull

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
requests and

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
uh github issues is actually quite nice

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
merging issues

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,600
just doing this generally good job of

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,039
kind of engaging with the community

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,640
and getting their feedback i think is

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,400
one of the things that makes this tool

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
really really successful

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
just in addition to this idea that's

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,760
kind of leaning into the idea that the

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,720
only kind of auditing

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
is continuous auditing right this uh

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
your environment's

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,640
changing in the cloud at the speed of

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,760
light

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
you know and you need something that's

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,039
kind of always out there always watching

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,559
looking for misconfigurations which is a

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,480
different talk in it of itself but

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,400
misconfiguration sorry trend that

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,640
continues to tick up

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
over the last two or three years and i

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
have to be honest the fact that i mean i

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
know he's kind of pivoted away from this

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
but the fact that it does give you that

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,640
visual output

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,240
i mean from my for my time it was well

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
worth being able to utilize it for some

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,960
of that where we would walk into an

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,559
environment not have any

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
background on the environment be able to

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
kick this off and know

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,080
oh i get it so this connects to that

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,880
that's important

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,000
yeah it's a it's a very active project a

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,080
very cool tool

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
take a look at it if you have some time

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
but the point here

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,080
with all three of these right is that

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
they they receive a lot of attention

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
from their

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
creators and the communities around them

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,720
uh they have they have

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,640
excellent curation and there is a

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,000
incentive for the businesses in the case

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
where there is a business involved to

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,039
kind of

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,600
support the work and that helps make

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,919
these three projects really successful

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,799
so we have a call to action for you

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,159
which is that

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,840
we are trying to refresh that 2018 data

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,200
with new 2020 data which we hope will

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
will trend a certain way or we have

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,520
theories about the way it may trend

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,880
but we'd like to hear from you so if you

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,960
have time

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,799
please fill out the survey uh jeff

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
breiner is going to refresh that data

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,559
and you have the ability if you choose

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,520
to it's not a required question

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,559
you can opt in to a mailing with the

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
results

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,880
or a later webinar we'll kind of do a

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,919
readout and talk about

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,159
the trends whether they're up or down

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
and kind of make some predictions based

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,559
on that

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,360
cool with that we thank you i'm andrew

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,760
and this is nathan

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,039
and that's our contact information there

you can follow me on twitter

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,120
i'll tweet about the security survey the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,039
the white paper uh coming out and you

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,840
