Multi-Factor-Authentication is nowadays known to a lot of people and used at many different places. MFA is meant to secure the users logins.

But if you do not only want to use MFA but if you are to provide 2nd factors to the employees in your organization, to your customer or to any user group, then you are faced with a lot of organizational challenges.

How can you ship hardware tokens to the users? How can users enroll their smartphone, without any secrets being compromised? Is it possible to use modern technologies like FIDO2 in your situation at all? How can you handle lost 2nd factors with the least effort for the users?

In the first part of this talk we will discuss several of those challenges that an organization is facing, where these problems originate and how those challenges can be handled in general.
In the second part we will take a look at the Open Source solution privacyIDEA, which is an enterprise ready MFA management system. We will see how those challenges can be coped with in a very flexible way using a unique event handler framework that allows to automate arbitrary processes.
