Title: [OLF 2020] An Open-Source Documentation Workflow loved by both Data Scientists and Engineers
Publication date: 2020-12-27
Playlist: 2020 Videos
Description: 
	Speaker: Colin Dean
I observed a white paper authoring collaboration workflow problem at my Forbes 50 employer wherein a tedious workflow around legacy tooling caused undue stress, headaches, rework, and, ultimately, a cosmetically poor-looking document with inconsistent content and styles. Knowing that a good document requires both good content and presentation, I proposed and led the creation of a simple workflow amenable to our team’s software engineers and data scientists: treating the white paper text as code with technologies including Markdown, GitHub Enterprise, Pandoc, LaTeX, and a review process that gets the tooling out of the way in order to enable content authors to focus less on logistics and more on writing and reviewing.

The result was that a team of seven engineers and data scientists created a 50-page document containing text, diagrams, equations, graphics, and more in just two weeks. The result greatly pleased our directors and executives. They praised our team not only for the incredibly valuable content, but also the professional appearance of the document. When they learned about the peer review process we used to create it, they wanted more teams to use it.

This talk focuses on the problems of passing around files by email or shared drives, the problems of collaborative editing of online documentation, and the problems we’re still addressing in our solution that we’ve now used to author several significant internal documents.

hello and welcome

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,639
i have some really great information to

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,719
share with you about how

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,559
corporation that i work for use some

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
really great open source software produ

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,520
to produce an absolutely fantastic

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,840
looking scientific document

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,039
and automated this system with

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
collaboration

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,560
and we had a great time doing it so

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
this is a documentation workflow loved

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,039
by both data scientists and engineers

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,039
alike

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
i'm this guy i'm generally wearing a top

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
hat and scarf at conferences

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
so in that spirit i'm wearing on right

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,360
now

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,200
lawyers say it's a good idea to display

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
and read this

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520
the views expressed herein are my own

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
and do not necessarily represent the

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
views of my employers or associated

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
organizations

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
past present or future

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,920
i work for target i'm based out of our

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
tiny pittsburgh office on robotics row

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,280
and the strip district

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,879
like most other tech workers i'm working

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
from home during the pandemic so i'm

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
recording this from my home office in

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,400
beautiful

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,200
wilkinsburg pennsylvania i run code

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,119
supply

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
a pittsburgh-based organization of more

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
than 6 000 software professionals

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,479
we run a co-working space in which we

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,000
normally hold meet-ups

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,920
and we run some conferences you may have

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,680
heard of like abstractions and artifacts

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
i've been involved in metamesh since its

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,159
humble beginnings as a bunch of 20

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,479
somethings

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
trying to build a citywide mesh network

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
in 2020 we're actually kind of getting

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
there

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
as we pivot to being a non-profit

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,439
wireless isp

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
so the task before us

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,560
our manager came to us one day and told

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,240
us about an upcoming off-site meeting

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
in which we'd been asked to present

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
about the work we've been doing

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,759
a part of that necessitated a write-up

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,200
detailing about how our product worked

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,560
at a high level

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,640
multiple people would be consuming it

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,479
we knew that we needed a well-designed

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
document that could be easily read when

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,079
printed but also take advantage of the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
aspects of hypermedia that we were using

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,959
to distribute it digitally

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,360
we would most likely deliver a pdf but a

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
long web page wasn't off the table

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
we knew that we needed to produce good

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
content but it needed to be

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,280
well summarized and be navigable

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,400
then there was a big change

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
a development pause

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
a product development was paused so we

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,959
needed to document

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,840
everything it may not be our team that

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
continues development

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,000
with that development our scope grew

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,160
and we had a whole lot more in-depth

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,599
knowledge that we needed to capture

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,800
for our team for prosperity stake

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,519
for example we we'd intended to

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,440
what we'd intended to be um the work the

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
depth of a quick tour of a house

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,840
turned into being an owner's manual

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
documenting every quark and hidden

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,959
compartment

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,000
back then there were seven of us

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,159
normally co-located

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
we each had different concerns and

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,800
interest to be recorded in the document

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
the engineers needed to show how the

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,599
product works

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,920
and how it's deployed as production

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
software the data scientists needed to

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
show the business logic behind that

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,239
software including the equations and

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,480
citations

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,599
with a veritable cornucopia of acronyms

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,519
initialisms

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,760
and other terms likely requiring need

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,200
for a glossary

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
we needed something that we could all

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
easily use and to which we could all

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,440
contribute simultaneously

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,519
after all we had just a handful of days

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,519
to complete this document

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,799
we needed a workflow that would get out

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
of the way and

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,080
let us focus on the content while still

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
looking professional

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
it's a good practice to figure out about

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,239
the things you value about a system

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
before you start building it

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,360
when i'm building software after the

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
initial idea comes

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,840
before i start engineering a system from

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
it i think about quality attributes

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,720
we assume that our content would be a

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,640
lot of text and diagrams and equations

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
we wanted a markup format that was very

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,160
easy to read

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
but preferably didn't require a special

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
program to read as we all

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,040
like to edit things differently that is

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
we wanted it to be reviewable on github

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,440
as well

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,440
and we wanted to not be able to control

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,919
the styling within the document

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,800
except for perhaps some semantic markers

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,120
calling out special sections

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
we wanted to be able to use latex if we

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,000
needed it

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
mostly because we knew we might want to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,919
draw a diagram

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
using txi one of the several diagramming

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,800
packages available for latex

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
lastly it needed to be easy for use for

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,720
both humans and computers

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
one command should build the document

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
and we should treat that document as a

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
build artifact

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,160
that is versioned and archived

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,919
the key idea is this this concept of

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
treating documentation

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,199
as source code is probably not novel to

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
most seasoned documentarians but for

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759
those for whom documentation

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,880
is all too often all too often an

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
afterthought

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
um

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,080
like many engineers and data scientists

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
this concept can be life-changing

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,919
this basically eliminated word apple's

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,759
pages

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,039
straight up latex and even our own

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
confluence wiki

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
and virtually every less well-known text

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,320
format

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
we considered some of the newfangled

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
tools like md book but found that they

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
didn't have the quality of pdf

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,280
output and the integration with the

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,479
niceties of the pandoc ecosystem

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,800
really we wanted to avoid this the team

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
really despised working in word and

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
strongly wanted to avoid authoring

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,280
it in our wiki system which we treat as

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,400
ephemeral and quickly out of date anyway

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
so a solution presented itself

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,319
we built a solution based on these

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,759
technologies in a few weeks

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
while also writing the pros

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,120
this got us simple text easily read

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,440
reviewed agreed upon through our

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,720
established systems of consensus

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,319
for source code review and produced the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
same way every time

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,440
it could even automatically notify

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:35,360
stakeholders whenever we released

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:40,240
a major new version the biggest benefit

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,160
was this you know latex without latex

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
our final document actually had very

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
little raw latex in it outside of

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
equations and a couple of diagrams we

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,160
were

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,199
simple enough to be redone using txz

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,039
instead of having them

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
as ping or svg images

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,000
let's talk about pandock the universal

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
document converter

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
pandock was started a while ago and hit

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,919
1.0 in 2008

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,680
with the 2.9 x release coming out

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,240
just as we were starting to build upon

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
it in late 2019.

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
pandoc is written in haskell but

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,440
supports lua for writing plugins

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,280
that process the abstract syntax tree

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,639
that pandock uses as an internal

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,800
representation

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,360
of the dozens of document format it can

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
read and write

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,599
some let's let's talk about some pandoc

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
basics

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,639
pandoc is available in virtually every

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
package manager and there are

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
downloadable installers available on

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
pandoc.org

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
pandoc attempts to figure out the input

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,479
and output formats based on the file

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,319
names but it's oftentimes better to be

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,000
explicit

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
this is an example output of running

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,879
pandoc on an early version of these

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
slides

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,240
which is written markdown and actually

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,599
uses pandoc to produce the code which

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,599
comprises this presentation

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
break down the chapters and sections

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,599
into separate files

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,960
and pandock will simply concatenate the

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,479
output

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,599
and the input you notice the use of

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,160
filters here

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
the choice of pdf engine that enables xe

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,360
latex

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
in order to use unicode and some other

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
implementation specific features that we

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,000
liked about xc latex over

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,879
pdf latex or some other engines note the

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
choices about

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
the table of contents section numbering

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
lists

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
of figures and tables and the

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,479
bibliography

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,120
really we really liked that command line

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,919
metadata options could be put into the

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,839
yaml

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
front matter of the document as well

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
metadata and some other options can

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,640
easily go into the yaml section at the

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,080
beginning of the document

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,640
pandoc also supports a configuration

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,399
file containing defaults i use this in

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,399
some newer projects to shorten

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,320
the make file reveal and powerpoint

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,440
are supported for first class output as

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,519
well

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
this presentation as i alluded to

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
earlier is written in markdown and

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,000
simply converted to her field.js

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,000
presentation

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,920
one of the things i constantly say about

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
whether you want to write a build system

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,360
or build a script is that any

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,640
sufficiently advanced build script

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,680
eventually simply re-implements make

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,519
there are some pando plugins for gradle

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
that will allow you to use that

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
ecosystem

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,480
i've almost always just come down to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,959
using make

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
there are many common plugins available

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,040
we've used siteproc

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,920
and crossref very extensively through

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,279
this

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,200
i've also used them through some other

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,080
projects that i've worked on

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,040
in this same stack some other cool

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
plugins

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
include code pulls in files which is

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,560
great for pulling in snippets and an

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,000
external file that might change over

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,200
time

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
in i'm making extensive use of pan pipe

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
in a workshop that i put together

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
i put code examples directly into the

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,040
document write those examples to a file

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,279
during the document build

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,440
and then subsequent code blocks would

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,480
actually execute or be the result

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,680
of the execution of a program on

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,320
those written files this made it really

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
great

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
to produce live documentation that was

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
changing as i was

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
adjusting examples and that i could be

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
sure that my example

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,360
output was never incorrect

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,959
these two together are fantastic for

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
ever changing data and source code

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
if you want to write your own plugins i

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
would strongly recommend writing them in

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
lua

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,079
which doesn't require installing or

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
compile compiling anything additional as

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
an anecdote

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,760
i needed to recompile panpipe and it

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,519
took about four hours on my

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,000
15 2015 mac versus if i would have

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,680
probably rewritten the same thing the

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
same software in lua i probably could

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,040
have written it in about an

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,480
hour so your mileage may vary on which

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
stack you decide to use

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,000
there's also python plugins that work

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,839
pretty well as well

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,200
but lua built right into pinetalk these

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,600
days

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,519
images can be in a variety of formats i

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,360
tend to convert everything to pdf and

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
then include the pdf version in the

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,640
markdown

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
because i know that pdf will look right

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
versus svg

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,760
because svg output rarely converts fonts

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
to paths

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,320
here i redrew a diagram using dixie

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,480
it looked a whole lot better than the

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,480
ping derived from a screen shot of a pdf

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,079
using the pandox site proc filter we can

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,279
easily enable bibliographical references

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,680
here you can see a a bibtex

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,680
entry

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,519
the next component in this system is git

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
git was originally

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,360
written to manage the linux kernel

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,800
source code linus and linus torvalds

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,639
himself wrote it

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,680
but it was really popularized in the

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:11,600
late 2000s and early 2010s by

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,200
github github is of course a widely used

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
public website with an on-premises

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,200
version called github enterprise it's

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,839
very widely used in the corporate world

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
you may also kind of mentally substitute

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,000
in gitlab in

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,240
almost all cases for this because the

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
methodologies that i'm prescribing as a

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,399
part of this

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,320
workflow work just the same in gitlab

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,839
and i've used them in gitlab

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279
to produce information for other

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
organizations

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,720
next i'll tell you about how my team

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
used this powerful tool

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,880
and these other powerful tools as well

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
to create a workflow that enabled

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,760
us to collaborate without having to pass

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,800
around a file

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,959
there are four primary tools here pandoc

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,959
git github and droneci

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,120
those of you familiar with github will

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,839
recognize this workflow

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,839
note how changes move around the system

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,560
there are some markdown specific text

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,440
editors out there

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,279
i'm a fan of macdown on because i use

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,440
mac os for work

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,279
but all too often simply come back to

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,800
vim with a bunch of plugins

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,760
for easily editing markdown one sentence

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
per line

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
makes it easier to suggest small changes

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,240
to documents during the review process

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,279
and i

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,000
highly stress writing in that

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,000
methodology

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,120
when you limit relevant content to a

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
single file you can definitely extract a

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,959
single chapter

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,880
or a few chapters into a single pdf this

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,680
is great for a summary pdf

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,000
or for testing only one file in a large

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,120
document as a part of the build process

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,839
debugging a build process our final

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,079
paper which is approximately 45 pages

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
took about 12 seconds to compile on my

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,320
2019 macbook pro

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,199
compiling only one section takes only

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
about two seconds

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,040
committing is important you want to use

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,000
git commits to tell a story about the

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,360
changes without necessarily describing

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in prose exactly what you changed

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,160
this is incredibly important over time

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,320
to make sure you understand

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,440
why the changes were made think of them

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
as

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,079
letters to your future self about why

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,079
you made a change

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,920
reviewing is

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,560
pretty much standard when it comes to

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
code review standards

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,480
you're going to have people who are

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
better at copy editing than others

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
you're going to have people who are

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
better at

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,000
word choice than others so your mileage

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,959
may vary based on your team

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,680
and their ability to be good copy

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,079
editors

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,120
i do a whole talk about code review and

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,480
pull requests

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,079
so i suggest watching um

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
watching some of those talks or reading

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,000
some of those talks that i've that i've

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
published in various forms if you search

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
for colin dean code review on your

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,680
favorite search engine you'll almost

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,519
assuredly find it

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,880
using automation like code owners in

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,199
github

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,959
is super important because people get

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
automatically assigned notified that

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
they have

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
review work to do

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,360
every time i've not set up a ci system

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,079
on a repo using this template

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,000
someone has managed to merge to master

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,399
something that breaks the pdf build and

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,079
it's been difficult to track down

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,440
i i know what to look for now

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
mostly that zelitek doesn't like greek

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,279
letters

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,279
inside of formatting inside of equations

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,600
and that's actually apparently no longer

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,519
a necessary practice it was a habit

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,680
of the mid-2000s that some people still

00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,680
do

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
use github's review system as it was

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,480
intended to be used

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,720
and you'll be in pretty good shape the

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,199
big thing is establishing a consensus on

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
any

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
on any changes that you're making

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
this was not without some pain some

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,839
things were easy to fix

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,959
others were hard and some are actually

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
even still unresolved

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,120
um some things that we we hit at first

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,639
were problems with installing

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,720
dependencies of course

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,360
uh mac tech is a very large download

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,880
it's almost a two gigabyte download

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
downloading that over the corporate vpn

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
is kind of painful sometimes

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,440
some folks had difficulty learning

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,639
pandox flavor of markdown

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,199
also a little bit difficult at times

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,920
especially when it came to tables the

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,759
way that markdown or the way that pandoc

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,800
handles regular markdown table format

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,440
is more restrictive than

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,880
pandoc's own built-in way of handling

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,120
tables that's a lot more expressive

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,880
we had some people who said why can't i

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,919
just use latex

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,839
i'll talk about them more a little bit

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
lastly we had some conversion problems

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,640
people who

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,400
had been maintaining some documentation

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,319
in word or in latex

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,319
wanted to come and play in our sandbox

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,919
but we found that some fidelity would be

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,360
lost whenever they did that

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:36,720
notably in losing cross references

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,880
um some other things uh we had this

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,120
um incomplete wysiwyg story where

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,039
folks would be trying to compile their

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
document and not understanding why

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,120
things weren't showing up

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
um rather than using like word where

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,760
you're you're

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,919
literally um wysiwyg or using a latex

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
editor like licks or tech studio where

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,080
you can

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,120
press a button and immediately receive

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
an in in editor feedback this was a

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
little bit more

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,600
janky at times because you'd have your

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
text editor and then you'd have a

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
preview

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,600
like apple preview running beside it

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,880
that would sometimes automatically

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,840
automatically reload or using a fancier

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,760
pdf editor

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
that pdf reader that would show you the

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
changed

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,240
document as the only

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,760
developer stakeholder in this project we

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
had bugs in the workflow every now and

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
then

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
i was the only person who was really

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
able to fix those bugs so

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,960
that kind of slowed us down at times

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,559
it's a standard bottleneck problem

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,559
moreover and probably the most

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,480
frustrating for almost everybody

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,919
was just editing equations was difficult

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,440
eventually we found latex latex

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,720
and mathjax.com those were good enough

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,200
for us to be able to

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,600
test a testing equation and have a

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,720
pretty good

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,200
assuredness that it was going to

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,360
actually work inside of

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,559
inside of pandoc we did have some

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,280
objections that folks had um a lot of it

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,480
came down to

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,080
well but i want to use latex okay that

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
kind of works

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
you can you can do that but you have to

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,360
own that file

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,840
because we we don't want to have to have

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,919
everybody else in the team learn latex

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,480
in order to be able to

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,919
manage your one file of course that is

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,280
not really scalable

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,200
if that in the same degree that oh a

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,480
developer wants to go write this module

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
in a different language than everybody

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
else knows

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,840
well what happens when they leave latex

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,120
is a little bit easier to learn

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,520
than a new programming language but

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,039
latex is a programming language so there

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,320
would be some

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,440
some safeguards would have to be in

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,679
place in order to make that really

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
happen

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,840
some folks also wanted to write

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,480
in whatever like word or latex and then

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,000
export

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,640
to pandoc markdown but there were some

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,640
there were some nasty sharp edges that

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,559
we found in that process as well

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
because there was an additional

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,600
transformation and they wouldn't always

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,640
propagate their things back

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
propagate their changes back the

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,240
greatest risk of these additional

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,280
transformation tools uh was overwriting

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,159
transformation output overwriting other

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,320
version files a bit is pretty hard

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,200
on three or four occasions we had some

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
major wework

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,480
rework because of it amounting to

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,480
several hours of

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,320
ever several hours of making the same

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,240
changes over again

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
in a subsequent use of this system which

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
i'll talk about a little bit later

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,799
one person strongly preferred to use

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
latex and another really strongly

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
preferred to use our markdown

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
and convert both to regular markdown and

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,679
be versioned so we have

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
both the like latex r markdown version

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,400
in the repository and the markdown

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,679
version um

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,559
this one okay but we have some caveats

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,120
i recommend avoiding this entirely store

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,919
the original document in the repository

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,000
and adjust the build system to handle

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,159
the conversion from the old format

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,159
into something that works with pandoc

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,679
but you don't have to take my word for

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
it

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,039
one person on my team a phd who loves

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,320
latex and still

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,000
uses latex for a lot of things he said

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
this level the pale the playing field

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
for contributions it's great for

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
collaborating and building documents

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
with all of the features of latex

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,240
because you can very easily drop down

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,400
into latex within the markdown document

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,600
because pandock is what pandoc is really

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
doing is just

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,240
converting anything that it doesn't

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,360
understand in the markdown document

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,559
to its own abstract syntax tree when it

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
encounters latex

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,600
it just treats it like latex tech like

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
latex text

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
the negative though we did find that

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,880
there were some problems

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,360
with fine level control of positioning

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,799
for figures and subfigures

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,520
what not they were just kind of small

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,600
things that

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,679
bothered us um and we haven't ever

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,720
really figured out how to

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,960
put a put a graphic on up

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
on a specific page we've almost always

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,320
just let pandoc figure out where the

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,320
where the figure should go

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,280
um current use our leadership was quite

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
impressed

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
not only with the document that we

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
produced

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
but also the system that we produced to

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,200
produce the document

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,039
we've since expanded to use to many

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
other teams including

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
one that's a fork of my original repo as

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,039
a basis for a documentation

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,039
project across several different teams

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,320
content is brought in by git sub modules

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,799
where each

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
repository is actually its own document

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,600
as well

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,280
one person inquired about writing a book

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,720
using this system

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,320
which is pretty awesome because the

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,159
basis of this system was actually what

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,159
was used to write the first edition

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,640
of a friendly friendly introduction to

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,360
software testing by bill laboon

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,200
i've used this system subsequently for a

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,799
yet unreleased

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,919
compensation survey project that i'm

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
doing for code and supply

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,880
this it was comprised of many tools

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
notably of course

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,960
the ones that i've been talking about

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,039
pandoc and

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,159
zaytek make git github

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,760
but of course there are many other in

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,159
here as well mac tech was our our chosen

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
tech installation because we're all on

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,679
macs

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,799
pandora crossref and site proc plugins

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,720
that i talked about

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,480
tektonic is another latex engine

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
written in rust that automatically

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,520
downloads modules so it's a very very

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,480
small

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,279
installation base very small and nimble

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,440
unfortunately

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
it didn't support all the things that we

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,080
were looking for

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
lib rsvg is what we used to convert our

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,039
svgs to pdf

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,720
and proselynt was a fantastic tool for

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,840
catching um copy editing mistakes and

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,799
archaic terms

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,159
and overuse of the word very in a

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
variety of things in fact

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320
when i was working on some revisions to

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,960
this this very presentation

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,919
uh proselynt caught that i was using the

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,360
word very

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,520
in multiple places so if you uh

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,799
go back and listen to this presentation

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,159
at some point in the future you'll find

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,919
that i'm almost never using the word

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
very

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,919
lastly i want to call out docker and

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
pandocker pandocker is a specific

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,360
container that

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,320
has a lot of a pandock ecosystem inside

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,080
of it widely used for

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
being able to use pandock inside of a

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,840
container which we used inside of our

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,440
our droneci system

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
my long-term vision for this is to have

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,159
a single source for this document system

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
that gets

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,799
turned into a bunch of easily consumable

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,400
formats creating a searchable archive of

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,480
sorts like an internal

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,440
archive.org the ar xiv.org

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,799
for our internal scientific documents

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,880
mike the team that i work on

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,240
is primarily data scientists with

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,279
several engineers

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,360
and we would really like to be able to

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,120
create a library of all the documents

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,880
that we've written that comprise

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:38,080
the describe and how all of the software

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,840
that runs the corporation is written

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,400
and then of course their style our

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,080
documents used mostly out of the box

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
pandoc and latex with a few

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,440
customizations

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,279
i'll probably leave computer modern as

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,760
the font because it just

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,640
conveys a certain error of

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,640
respectability

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,799
so when you get a chance uh go check out

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,000
pandoc

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
at pandoc.org

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,120
um some references and attributions i

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,000
used a few icons

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,720
from font awesome and then of course i

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
would be

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
remiss not to mention a friendly

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,520
introduction to software testing by bill

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,159
laboon

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
the source code on which a lot of this

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,640
is based

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,360
and it's also just a really good book by

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,360
a good friend of mine

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,039
you can find the raw source for these

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,039
slides including the build system to

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,360
help build the slides

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,960
on my github repository and of course a

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,919
rendered version will be available on my

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,919
speaker deck profile

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
that's all folks thank you very much for

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,640

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,840
she's like hey you should take your

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,480
sweatshirt like in a socially distanced

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,600
questions for you but

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,520
i wondered what conferences are you

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,760
missing the most now because you're not

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,279
missing olf

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,120
um uh so uh i ran hard facts back in

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,240
august uh heart affects the code and

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,000
supply conference

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,840
on um mental health for software

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,640
professionals and

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,919
i was missing uh the the physical

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,159
presence of people there but we still

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,399
have a reasonable facsimile of it

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,159
with our online presence that's what

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,520
we're hoping for the reasonable

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,720
facsimile standard yes yes

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,159
um likewise with uh devops days buffalo

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,080
i enjoy going off to buffalo for that

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,240
conference yeah

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
you have people saying pass my congrats

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,279
on to colin and pittsburgh

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
heart um so so i want to talk pdf

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,200
because

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,399
there's a few questions here about um

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,440
is it an open standard you know

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,279
how do you feel about it people

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,640
you know what are what is your thoughts

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,200
on adobe

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,080
and like you know it is a standard that

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,880
everybody uses

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,200
so do you have any opinions i guess yeah

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,360
so

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,559
um it's my understanding the pdf is an

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,760
open standard there's

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,159
there are a big pdf

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,960
we're up to like 1.5 of the the open

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,520
standard

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,080
i know that adobe puts some proprietary

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,480
stuff

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,760
into their into pdf documents that

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,480
um their particular software produces

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,159
um and most open source software and

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,200
pretty much everybody who's not adobe

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,640
just uses the standard um 1.4 was the

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,679
the kind of the target standard for a

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,600
long time and i think almost

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,360
everything's moved to 1.5 i know i think

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
1.5 came out like three or four years

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,919
ago

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,960
yeah that's it's an open standard and

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,360
um i guess another question see

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,880
i have a lot of kind of end users so

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,720
sure um they

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,520
so basically like what is your favorite

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,880
pdf reader and why

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,360
i also have some q a um in the zoom chat

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,919
to

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
send over sure yeah let's let's let's

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,640
hit pdf stuff first um so

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
i tend to use um apple preview most of

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,720
the time um

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,640
i'm i'm on a mac for work and a mac

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,919
it's kind of split pretty evenly between

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,279
mac os and windows

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,120
and linux for my home stuff

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
and i'm using apple preview a lot of the

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,080
time um

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
on windows i like fox it um oh yeah

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,720
i really

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,360
try to avoid using adobe reader as much

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,919
as i can i've got just too many stories

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,840
just wait like let me let me edit this

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,880
oh i can't oh i have to pay oh wait

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,640
it's okay there's another pop-up um yeah

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,840
that's basically my experience

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,919
yeah yeah on linux i'm i just use

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,559
whatever whatever work whatever works

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,360
um i think events was uh events was the

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,679
the big thing

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,880
back in the day that came out of um um

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,200
i can't remember the name of that

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,000
project now events was like the pdf

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,600
reader from

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,440
a kind of niche um niche distro that

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,799
just kind of took off everywhere

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,679
yeah yeah

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,279
yeah so um i guess people are wondering

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,679
about like the scale

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,320
and of being in a big corporation and

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,120
having to scale up to it and

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,080
like what was your experience in just

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,240
thinking at

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,200
massive scale for things is that did

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
that come into play

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,960
not so much in this particular um

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,919
this particular product this particular

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,240
project

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
um and when we were working on the

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,200
product that we were working on which i

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,760
unfortunately can't talk about

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,279
um we did have to get that a very very

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,559
very large scale

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,000
um i i can say that it dealt with

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,240
um basically a a tremendous amount of

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,840
data

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,720
over 9000 data okay yes

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,279
uh and that um that was an adjustment

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
for me

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,320
uh i i've worked on i've worked on

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,919
um certainly gigabyte scale i've worked

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,760
on terabyte scale data i've not worked

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,799
on petabyte scale data before

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,159
um that was that was an adjustment for

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,000
me to deal with

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,799
and just the that's oh go ahead sorry

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,519
yeah this this and and then this product

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,919
um you know

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,760
this particular thing like we were

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,880
working with a lot of data but this

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,720
um when we were writing the document um

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
a lot of the work had been done so we

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,840
were able to very clearly

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,640
write down in um in concrete terms as

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,679
well as

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,159
using good old-fashioned equations

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
to to represent what we were doing you

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,320
know there's

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,760
it's one thing there's two different

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,720
representations whenever you're trying

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
to express

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
how business logic is formed like you

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,519
can write things in equation formatting

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,240
you can write things in code

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,760
um and our target audience for the most

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,960
part was writing was

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,799
expecting to read uh equations um

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,559
yeah i wanted to set up something that i

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,519
was able to write in code in some places

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,760
and we and we

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,039
ended up ended up eventually writing a

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,159
little bit of code in the document

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,880
although that wasn't the

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,640
the primary way of con of conveying what

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,360
we were doing

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,360
yeah and i guess um this is kind of just

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,000
a general question like what makes you

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,720
prefer the workflow this workflow over

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,960
others

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,080
like did you try other things that

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,919
failed

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,240
miserably i'm sure the answer is yes to

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,200
that question but

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,840
um uh as i said during the presentation

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,159
we really

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,000
really really wanted to avoid the

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,919
constant renaming of a single

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,399
like binary word file like that was

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,880
that's

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,919
that's that's a special level of hell

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
and i

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
just didn't want to deal with it it's

00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,760
really good that you knew that ahead of

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,320
time

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,600
because as i taught i talked about in my

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,120
talk that was

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,119
far less advanced but just essentially

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,079
picking a standard and like running with

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,280
it that that speaks volumes

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:19,119
yeah thinking about it it's a

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,800
a life-changing exercise to be able to

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,240
consider something from what

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,280
you want out of it like i'm not i

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,320
i i was a long time linux user and i

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,320
specifically chose to purchase a map

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,560
because i wanted something that i could

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,560
close the lid and it would reliably

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,560
be ready to go the second i reopened the

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,280
lid that wasn't the only reason

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,960
that was that was a a major reason and

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,879
now i'm finding myself going

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,720
back to linux because i don't have that

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,320
i don't have that requirement

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,159
there's a there's some other things

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,720
about mac os that i don't

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,599
i don't need anymore you know i i that

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,440
the rise of docker has changed my life

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,880
and now i'm fighting i want to use

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,760
docker everywhere

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,640
yeah we we had a talk i don't know if

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,720
you were in our

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,480
talks and the boss i think we talked

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,320
about docker we had like a container

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,599
talk we had a container all the things

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
talk we had

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,200
um a lot of stuff going on for the but

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,320
you're more than welcome to i think

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,960
we're going to end up spinning up

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
another one

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,640
at the end of uh today but i guess i

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,880
want to ask

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,160
one more question because i love asking

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,079
this like what

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,920
for how did you first learn about linux

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,800
like what what's your first

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,920
you're go back take us back way back to

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,200
the time

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,680
before the before times okay so

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,520
um i have a mine might be a little bit

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
of weird story compared to some other

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,040
people

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,680
oh okay i used to play ultima online uh

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,119
a a video game in the late 90s early

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,280
2000s

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,040
and um uh i tend to rise into the

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
leadership of any organization that i'm

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,920
involved in it just it just happens

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,040
naturally personality yeah

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
yeah just my personality and um i ended

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,119
up

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,599
being a gm or asked to be a gm on a game

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,839
master

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,280
on an ultima online shard it was a

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,920
fantasy role-playing game

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,240
with like a three-quarter view ultima

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
online i feel like it's dating ourselves

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,920
right now but yeah totally um and it

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
just so happens

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,040
that the software that was

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,359
running the server was running on this

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,480
thing called linux

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,760
and um yes the the other gm's who are

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,440
running the server

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
asked me they're like okay we can let

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,800
you we can let you directly edit

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,079
the the scripts that um govern how the

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,599
game works

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,839
um but have you ever used linux i'm like

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,040
no they're like have you ever used dos

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,760
i'm like yeah i've used

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,720
dos a good bit i was i was 13 or 14 at

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,240
the time

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,000
um and uh they're like okay well

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,599
here go read this go read this website

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
and i think it was like the the linux

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,880
documentation project

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,040
and um so for i

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
it was in like 2000 or 2001 was the

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,320
first time that i ever

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,920
connected to a linux server and i was

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
like using ssh

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,760
to connect to this linux server and then

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,400
in your mind you're

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,599
like a kid sort of so that this was just

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,839
like what you needed to do

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,800
to get the result of having exactly

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,480
exactly

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,560
and not a it was like a month later or

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,520
so i just happened to mention in passing

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,000
to my mother

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,760
who was always very much like buy me

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,520
anything that i wanted that was related

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,040
to learning because she was a teacher oh

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:34,640
very cool um she bought me this this box

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,119
was called linux for windows and what it

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,520
really was was a live cd with fat linux

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,920
on it

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,280
a little distribution it was one of the

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,400
first live cds

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,320
very cool and i used and i

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,640
i basically used linux for a summer and

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,880
it was it was really awesome

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,880
and so i love i love how your story is

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,560
like we i used linux but i didn't

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,040
necessarily know at the time that that

00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,440
was what i was using

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,880
it was it was a cool um it was a cool

00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,079
requirements-based way to do it like

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,119
there's there's a lot of people who come

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
to linux

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,400
come to to free and open source software

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,119
through

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,480
um of a philosophy but not necessarily

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,920
requirements

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,000
yeah exactly and that's um i love

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,760
the way to do it you know that's

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,839
actually my favorite

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,839
quote and i might steal that like they

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,000
come into linux with a philosophy

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,680
like through the philosophy i think

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,160
that's why we get the warm and fuzzies

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,720
about it

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,520
but thank you so much for your time oh

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,480
my goodness

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,400
like so very much i was like i want to

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
have more birds of a feather so we can

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
like

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,119
keep this going forever because this is

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,160
a wonderful conference experience thank

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,560
you so much

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,560
