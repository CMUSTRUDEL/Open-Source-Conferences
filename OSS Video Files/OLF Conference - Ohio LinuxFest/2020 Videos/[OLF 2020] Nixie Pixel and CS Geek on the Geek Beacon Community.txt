well here's nixie

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,440
tell us about game night thanks warner

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,040
yeah that's

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
some of the main challenges that we have

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,759
going digital is getting the time zones

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,320
right

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,240
having everybody overseas be able to

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
also enjoy everything we're doing

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,760
um yeah thanks for the intro for those

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
who don't know me

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,519
i'm nixie ten years ago i worked for the

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
likes of

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,560
tech tv if you remember this is like

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,199
calling out my age but screensavers

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
call for help i used to hang out with

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,120
chris pirillo and leo laporte and

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,200
patrick norton a lot

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,079
and i was basically the first and the

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,280
last person probably to bring linux to

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,920
and open source to the discovery channel

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
maybe the last actually because open

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,440
source was cool but

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,719
maybe not cool enough for broadcast

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,320
television for long

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,160
can't compete with a reality tv so

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,360
i hung around my youtube channel for a

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,920
couple years and then i

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
spun off geek beacon and we're an open

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
source community

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,880
but now we have around 6 000 people

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,640
and coders gamers techie lovers and we'd

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
love for you to be one of those people

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
and hang out with us and we're kicking

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,920
off the buffs

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
birds of a feather i think everybody

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,600
here that's that knows about olf knows

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
what aboff is right warner

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,880
yeah for the most part um

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,840
boss are known in other communities as

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
um well open spaces so there's different

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,240
names for it

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,079
but i i think kara the olf crew knows

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,040
boss pretty well

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
yeah i remember at some of the like far

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
eat well not that far

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
east but east coast um conferences that

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
we did we had

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
fish bowl conversations have you ever

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
heard of that before that's like

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
completely foreign to people i guess

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,520
it's essentially like most people are

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
quiet and then

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
you they're outside of the fishbowl and

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,240
the people who are inside of the

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,759
fishbowl talk

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
and then if you want to speak about

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
things you kind of like

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
politely poke the people in the in the

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,520
fishbowl and then you switch seats

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,920
and that's kind of like the atmosphere

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,160
that we'll have in our discord so

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,280
i'm not sure where the discord link is

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,440
located in

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
this conference maybe you wouldn't mind

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
