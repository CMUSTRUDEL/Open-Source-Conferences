	00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,160
today what we want to do is give just an

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,800
overview of the work

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
of the fsf campaigns team uh what we

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,519
spend

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,120
all of our time doing um because we know

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
that a lot of people in the audience

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
will be familiar with the technical

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,240
aspects

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,039
of free software and the gnu linux

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
operating system but they might not know

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,480
what the free software foundation really

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,680
does or how long we've been around or

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,199
things like that so

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,119
really our goal today is to give an

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
overview of

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,960
all the aspects of our work especially

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,719
the work of the campaigns team and then

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
let everybody know how they can get

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
involved so we're really excited to

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,760
be here and then uh this is pre-recorded

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,520
obviously

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
but uh i'll be sticking around for

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
questions a little bit later so if you

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
have any just

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,120
feel free to shout out um and this is

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
just an outline of the general stuff we

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,920
plan to go over today so

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,120
i'm going to start off with an

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,760
introduction you know if you've never

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,199
heard of the fsf before that's okay

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,280
free software a lot of the conference

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,800
presentations today will use the term

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,320
open source

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,960
we prefer the term free software for

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,600
reasons we'll get into a little later

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
we'll focus on some campaign initiatives

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
give you some encouragement

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
on how you can live a fully free

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,759
software life

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,159
in the digital world and then how you

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,920
can get involved uh both with the fsf

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,520
community and the fsf

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,439
in general so uh let's get going um

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,560
so what's free software and what's the

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
fsf well

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
the our mission statement you can see

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,439
this at the top of our website

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,280
which is where i got it from the free

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,360
software foundation is a non-profit with

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
a worldwide mission to promote computer

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,799
user freedom

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
um and that can mean a lot of things

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
obviously that's a very broad

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
mission statement but in practice this

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,360
means educating the public

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
about free software and the dangers of

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
proprietary software

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
and one thing that the episept is known

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,680
for famously and infamously

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
is that we do all of our work with free

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
software

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,119
everything all of our laptops are about

00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
11 years old because they run a free

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
bios

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
and free software even powers our office

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,799
phones

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
so we're very committed to using fully

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
free software to do our work

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,000
which i think gives us a pretty

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
distinctive perspective

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
when it comes to encouraging other

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,160
people to go 100

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,160
when it comes to software for you

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,640
we i'm gonna introduce you a little bit

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,080
into uh what we do here at the fsf

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,239
um we are split up

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,480
mostly in three teams uh the campaigns

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
team the licensing team and the fsf tech

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
team

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,239
the licensing team as it says right here

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
is the steward of the new general public

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
license and defense copyright on the gnu

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,920
project

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
the licensing team does compliance

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,879
management they also

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,920
have an organization called

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,159
ryf respect your freedom in which they

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,519
certify hardware products to make sure

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,840
that they are free

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,159
and they hold a seminar um

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,239
annually which is a sealy seminar

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,640
on copy left and legal ethics

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,879
just to help educate law professionals

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,879
and

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,040
licensing advocates to

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,800
know sort of what is the latest when it

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
comes to copyleft and licensing

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,000
regulations

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,200
we then also have a tech team the tech

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,360
team is

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,920
four people strong and they

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
maintain and provide the infrastructure

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,799
for the new project and

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,200
a few other fully free software projects

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:49,040
they build and maintain our servers

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,920
they maintain the mailing lists and um

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,959
uh help other developers uh and answer a

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,120
bunch of questions

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
when it comes to technical free software

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
stuff

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
um then there is the campaigns team of

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
which greg and i

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,080
are a part our third member is dana

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,720
morgenstein

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
the campaigns team basically advocates

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,159
for free software and pushes against

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,280
proprietary software

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,040
so we produce educational materials we

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,400
organize protests um petitions

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,720
we do the international day against drm

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
um greg will tell you a little bit later

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,960
about that we also host superplanners

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
which is our annual conference on free

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
software issues

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
and technology which i will tell you a

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,360
little bit later about as well

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
generally we make sure that we spread

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
awareness

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,919
organize events and educate people on

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,040
what free software is and how they can

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,040
help spread that message

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
uh yep so a lot of people you know we're

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,280
throwing around the term free software

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,479
but just in case there are people in the

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
audience who

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
may not know exactly what that term

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,960
entails and maybe how it uh

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
is distinct from the concept of open

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
source

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,280
um we provided the free software

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
definition here

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
and any program is free software

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,600
provided it gives its users

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
four basic freedoms so freedom zero

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
because a lot of things in the computer

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
world start with zero

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,759
uh the freedom to run the program as you

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,120
wish for any purpose

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,479
so a lot of um uh eula's or

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
end user license agreements or

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
proprietary software they'll actually

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,639
discriminate against fields of endeavors

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
so

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
famously the itunes eula will say that

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
you can't

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,680
use itunes in a nuclear testing facility

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
just in case you know that bloated piece

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
of garbage

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
sets off a bomb or something so that

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
would be pretty bad

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
but in contrast to that free software

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,919
allows you to use the program for any

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
purpose that you want

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,759
and also allows any person to use it

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
some proprietary software will also

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,360
discriminate against

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,320
people based on where they live uh for

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
example or

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
you know certain beliefs they have

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
they're really all kinds of things you

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,199
can find a viewless if you actually

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
uh take the time to read them but

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
freedom one

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,280
uh that follows freedom zero is the

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,000
freedom to study the program how the

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
program works

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
and to change it if you want so this uh

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
will obviously require the source code

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,960
to the program

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
because if you're just looking at binary

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
code it's not really very fun and it's

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,400
not really easy to tell

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,319
the actual functionality of the program

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,319
freedom 2 is the freedom to redistribute

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
copies so you can help others so

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
you know if i have a copy of a really

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,759
cool free software program i like

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,440
i can send it to zoe without fear of

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
somebody breathing down my neck

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,039
saying that it was wrong for me to share

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
with my neighbor so freedom 2 is a very

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,039
important freedom when it comes to

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
democratizing the access of free

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
software um it doesn't mean that you

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
can't

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,960
sell it it just means that anyone

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
is free to to copy it and share it with

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
a friend if they want

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,639
and then the final freedom freedom three

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,560
is the freedom to redistribute copies of

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,080
your modified version so if i take

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
you know a cool free software program

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,960
and i change it a little bit maybe

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,639
change the name to like craig's cool

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
software program and like add a function

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
or something

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,800
uh freedom three would give me the

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,360
freedom to distribute copies

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,520
of my modified version to others with

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,440
the same kind of

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,039
ability that that freedom 2 would grant

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,599
me

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,479
and in practice open source and free

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,440
software

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,319
they refer to the same programs but free

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,960
software

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,120
is a term that we use because it puts

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,160
the emphasis solely on user freedom

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,720
the fsf is a technological

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
social justice organization and since we

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
view

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,400
proprietary software as fundamentally

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000
unjust

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
we want to keep our language always

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
grounded and always focused on freedom

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,759
and open source is a kind of

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,039
technologically neutral term

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
if you look at the history you'll see

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,840
that open source was coined to actually

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,680
avoid

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,039
uh certain political connotations with

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
the term free software

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
uh we're not afraid of those political

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,680
connotations and in fact we

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
embrace them and uh because we we think

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
that

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,039
all computer users deserve freedom so

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
that's just a basic rundown of free

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,879
software definition in case you're

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
unfamiliar

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,840
then a brief history on the new project

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,199
so the gnu project was started in 1985

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
by richard salman

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,039
with the goal of writing an operating

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,599
system that was fully free software

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,280
um for those of you interested and have

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,720
not read about this yet

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,919
richard salman has published his story

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
on how he ran into difficulties with a

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,440
printer at some point that which

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,519
prompted him to start

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
working um against proprietary software

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
which

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,360
sort of came up around that time um

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,160
he started with some

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,839
simpler projects and then by 1991 most

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,800
of the new

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,720
system was complete um but it didn't

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,320
have a kernel yet and so

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,640
when um linux

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
came out uh that was a perfect

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,360
combination so when combined with canoe

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,279
glue linux

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,200
was the operating became the operating

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,160
system uh that we all now

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
know and still use and um is fully free

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,760
software

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,880
when something that um has developed and

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,240
sort of

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
became the core of um what pushed free

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
software forward

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
canoe is still developing still going

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,399
strong as well packages are still being

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,959
created

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
uh and collected and this is something

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
that you can also see through our

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
website

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,440
you can see that i think there are about

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,800
16 000 packages right now

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,680
maybe even more and

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,640
there are some projects that are still

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,160
going really strong and doing

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,720
progressive and important things

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
so one of them for example is new geeks

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
a reproducible package

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,839
manager and then there's gnu taylor

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
which is a free software payment system

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,320
um and then of course there is movie max

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,480
which is one of greg's favorites

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
uh and they wrote this presentation with

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,560
it

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,120
um so a lot of the time uh everybody's

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
using free software you know if you use

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160
gnu linux you're using free software um

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,880
but you're

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,399
likely not using 100 free software or

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,480
fully free software

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
um and this is pretty important uh

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
because as i mentioned before you know

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
the fsf considers proprietary software

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
to be

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,240
a social injustice so really i mean if

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
there's a single proprietary component

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
left

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,040
in your you know software distribution

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,040
or left uh that you're dependent on

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,720
in your laptop for example you're being

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
uh you're being oppressed right

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
literally

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
um and so we recommend the use of fully

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
free distributions

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,040
of gnu linux there's a list of these on

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,040
gnu.org

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,079
triscale is the main one that we use at

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
the fsf

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,480
for all of our office computers um it's

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
actually headed by our cto reuben

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,800
rodriguez

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,600
um so we're big fans of that um but

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,320
you know often uh the matter of like

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
choosing

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
a fully free software distribution it

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
can be kind of technically difficult

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
which is why the fsf started the

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,440
respects your freedom initiative

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,440
and that's a way for manufacturers to

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,279
certify that their hardware

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
runs fully free software so if a laptop

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
was certified and it got the ryf

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
certification

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
that would mean that that laptop

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,680
entirely runs on free software down to

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,279
the bios level

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,480
um and often you know it's it's

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
people say like well what's the point

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
like what's the point of having 100 free

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
software

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
um and there are so many places where

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
that can really

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,000
kind of come to uh be important right

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
because

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,240
if you're using like a proprietary

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
network driver uh for your wireless card

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,079
uh which is often the case in gnu linux

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
like who's to say that there's

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
not some kind of malicious function that

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
uh a

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,399
you know three-letter security agency

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
could use to

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
uh you know intercept your

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,279
communications or anything like that and

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
at the same time you know a free bios is

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,000
important because

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,440
uh the uefi bios in most laptops you

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
know that's six million lines of code

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
that's like

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,120
an enormous attack vector for one thing

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,800
um but

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
more crucially you know that's like a

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
giant piece of your computer that is not

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,120
directly under your control

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,600
so we always emphasize the need to run

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
uh

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
fully free software

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,440
on advocacy and community then a bit one

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,720
of the chief ways that the fsf

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,120
team our team of greg myself and dana

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,560
promote free software is through writing

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,959
and doing local

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,000
advocacy efforts we try and include the

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,240
community

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,920
um and have a big voice that can be

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
heard all over the world

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
this can be a challenge of course

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
sometimes

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,680
we need to make sure that we explain uh

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
the concepts of free software

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,120
um to people that do understand and have

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
a technical background but also

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,040
sometimes to people that don't

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,040
understand it as much and that we want

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,000
to sort of include in our story as well

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,760
because if anything

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
we need to be welcoming to make sure

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,920
that we have a big crowd of people

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
to be able to advocate for free software

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,200
in the future

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,360
as well um so at fsf.org we're

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,240
regularly commenting on how recent

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
events

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
impact our computer user freedom and how

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,120
organizations like

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
google apple or microsoft put them at

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,720
risk

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,800
and how for example

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,880
sometimes the way politics or

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,959
society is responding to the different

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
kind of power that they have

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
those large corporations and

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
organizations

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,639
should be seen through the window of um

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,639
if any if only

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,920
we would be working with free software

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,760
then a lot of the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,199
situations that we find ourselves in

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,839
daily where our user

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,279
freedoms are being encroached um

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,480
wouldn't happen as much

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
so we try and uh jump on top of recent

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
defense

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,639
and uh communicate about that and help

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,120
see people where the injustices lie

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,839
as much as possible um and as much as we

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,959
can within

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,560
our small team we are also the fsf's

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,240
main point of connection with the global

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
free software community and

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
we do our best to stay involved in

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,959
discussions on how technology can

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
empower us and deprive

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,680
them of their freedom um

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,040
we uh host a forum

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,800
on our website for our associate members

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,399
where we communicate with community

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
members and learn from them sort of what

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
the asians are that are

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,839
on their on their minds and there are

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,360
also new email lists that help us

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,040
where we see community members

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,320
communicate about different issues that

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,360
are happening in the world

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,800
and that we can jump on as well

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
we're always looking for members of the

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,079
community to help us

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
work with this so if you are already an

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
associate member please jump on the

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
forum forum and share your voice

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
we are not always communicating there

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
but we are always following what's

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,959
happening

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,000
um as well as uh the the planet discuss

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,120
email list has

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
the same effect we don't always

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,399
communicate or

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
add to the conversation there but we do

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
definitely follow and

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,760
find it unbelievably interesting and

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
important to read and hear what people

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,279
have to say

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,959
um and then there is our working

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,079
together for free software project which

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,279
is something that we do

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,279
on our fsf.org website where

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,320
this is a bit two-fold so on the one

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,320
hand

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
the fsf is the financial steward for

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
some other organizations

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,920
um that are important for the future of

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,959
free software and that are doing

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,639
important things

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,320
and you can see through our website

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600
which organizations they are and if you

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
want to support those

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
organizations you can do that through

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,959
the fsf and we will make sure

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,800
that they get the support that you give

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
and then the other side of that is

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,240
really the um

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,000
more community focused side of it in

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
which we try and

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
talk to and listen to community members

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
and have you publish

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,320
um on our website what is free software

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,959
and why it's important to you

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,800
or for example how you encounter working

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,480
with free software or dealing having to

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,480
deal with proprietary software and your

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
work and how you deal with those things

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,920
um and we feel that those things are

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,959
very important there's often

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,639
question for example about whether or

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,759
not you can earn any money doing free

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,680
software and

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,639
um if you are not a technical person

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,959
what can you do

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,519
to still build your career in this world

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,000
um fighting for user freedom

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,920
and questions like that can really be

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
answered by us or by anyone that you

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,160
know but it's

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,759
um a sort of homecoming feeling when you

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,440
can find on a website a story

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
written by someone that you know is

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,320
successful you respect

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,639
um and uh sort of you can

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
it helps you find out how they got to

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
where they are

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
um so when you have a moment dive into

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,480
that read about it there's some really

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,480
interesting people on there

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,880
yeah for sure um and

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,320
we understand that if maybe a few of

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,519
these have been played as bumpers

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
in the olf uh schedule but just in case

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
they weren't

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,600
uh we've lately been making uh animated

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,199
videos to explain free software concepts

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,679
the first of these was shoe tool which

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,600
we debuted last year

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,919
it's kind of holiday themed and kind of

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,280
paste the picture of an elf who doesn't

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
have control over his

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,120
hardware and that kind of ends up

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,480
being uh pretty bad for him more

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,319
recently we did the university of

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
costume heroes which was a

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,080
warning about the dangers of proprietary

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
remote education

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,360
when implemented in a university of

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
superheroes

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,520
can go pretty dangerously wrong and then

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
i think last month we developed a rewind

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
which is a video

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
to teach others about the positive

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
impact free software can have on the

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,799
scientific community

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,440
covers a scientist who's researching um

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,960
a cure for a disease and it shows the

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,640
positive impact that free software could

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
have but then it kind of rewinds since

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
the title

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
and shows what would happen if you know

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,360
she didn't have

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,919
access to free software if instead the

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,960
program she was using was proprietary

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,559
um and we think that that's a pretty

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
good video so we hope that you'll check

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,360
them out if you haven't already

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,039
i uh can i add to that a little bit grey

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,559
yeah sure

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,960
um the um what we have

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
uh issues with sometimes within the

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
stuff is that

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,360
free software is something that sort of

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,480
stretches out over a lot of different

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,039
aspects of life um it's not just about

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
software

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,320
it is it affects us in many many

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
different ways

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,600
and what we're trying to do with these

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
videos is really sort of make sure

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,840
um that we explain all these different

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,760
angles and that we

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,360
that when when people that don't really

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
know the concepts of free software or

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,400
even if you do

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,840
you run into these issues in daily life

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
and there's some sort of a moment of

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,600
recognizing

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,200
um that this is something that could be

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,039
different or should be different

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,240
uh and then your freedoms are really

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,919
sort of being

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,440
um abused in that sense and so

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,039
what we're trying to do is really

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
highlight all of these different angles

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,880
and shoe tool

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,559
for example really focuses on drm and

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,559
user lock-in

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,400
in that sense and the university of

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,160
costumed heroes as it says here is about

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
remote education but it's also really

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
about

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,760
sort of back doors into your machines um

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,640
and uh you not having full control over

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
the machines uh the technology that you

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
use

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,799
and how that can be abused and how

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,480
that's dangerous for

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,200
society but also for our future and of

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,760
course there's also the aspect of

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,160
um how in education it's important to

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,320
use free software in general because uh

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
when it comes to

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,480
being a student um what you are being

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
taught is how things work

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
uh but you're not allowed to see how the

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
tools that you

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,799
learn this through work actually

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
wiggle bump they talk about this a

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,280
little bit more later

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,000
uh and of course in the rewind video we

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,280
talked about

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,320
um really the core of the free the four

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,640
freedoms is when you

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,400
uh want to be able to see the software

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,280
see the source code and be able to share

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
it and

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,559
enhance it which is something that is um

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,960
how science is moving forward and how

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,679
society keeps moving forward if we have

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,200
the right

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,880
to actually improve on things that

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
already exist and we can't improve on

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,840
things that already exist if we can't

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,840
see what it's made of

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,520
yeah definitely um so one of the major

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,919
campaigns that the fsf runs

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,280
is the defective by design campaign

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
which is our campaign it

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,520
digital restrictions management uh

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
commonly known as drm

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,360
um and the reason for the defective by

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,600
design title

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,799
is that you know if you think about how

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,159
drm works

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,840
and how it's used they're really

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,679
creating a product that is by intention

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,159
defective by design right so like

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,799
who would think to make an ebook that

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,400
you can't

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,000
share with a friend for example you can

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
share any normal file

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
with a friend so by you know putting

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
something in the ebook that you download

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that prevents it from being transferred

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,200
uh they're intentionally making some

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,559
kind of faulty

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,720
uh product or faulty file or item and

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,080
uh this is i mean this is an injustice

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
in itself but often

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,840
uh in the way drm is implemented it

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
becomes a grave threat to computer user

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,960
freedom

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,799
uh because it also relies on proprietary

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,640
backdoors to function

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
these this can be in software uh and it

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,200
could also be hardware so

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,600
with the widevine drm uh that

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,280
uh is behind uh netflix and a lot of

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,480
other video streaming sites

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,200
um there are multiple levels of uh kind

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,039
of

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,440
multiple levels of a stranglehold right

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,200
that uh the company has on you so

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,559
at the lowest level there's software but

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,320
actually um

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,840
increasingly and this is a big problem

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
for free software is

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
uh drm is being implemented on the

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
hardware level um so

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,559
you know it just bypasses straight

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,200
through the os and then runs on a chip

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,919
that we

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
are you neither us or anyone else has an

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,360
idea of what it's really doing

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,600
so you can see where this would be a big

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
problem for free software and anyone any

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,480
free software activists because if we

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,840
insist on having 100 uh free software

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,520
components in the systems that we use

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,720
um having this malicious chip you know

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
that's running

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
uh this entirely different set of

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
instructions just to

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
prevent you from doing something you

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,640
should be able to do anyway uh it

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,799
becomes a pretty big deal pretty fast

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
so each year we also sponsor uh through

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,120
defective by design

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,799
an annual day of protest against drm uh

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,720
called idad and this year's is on

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,240
december 4th uh this is the

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,280
14th that we've done i think so uh we're

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,520
excited to

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,360
uh be having that it's going to be

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,120
targeting netflix this year

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
um just because in times of the

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,799
quarantine people have been

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,480
increasingly dependent on streaming

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,840
services to

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
get their entertainment which is totally

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,000
normal but

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,840
when they also uh subjecting themselves

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,880
to drm that's a problem right it's

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,240
a problem for the the user because

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
they're being oppressed it's not you

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
know

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
we're not attacking the people who are

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
actually watching the sub we're going

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,280
after the corporations that

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
insist on using drm to lock down their

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,679
media

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,440
and you can learn more about the

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,600
defective by design campaign at

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,559
defectivebydesign.org

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,360
and then the day against drm specific

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,840
website

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
is day against drm.org

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,039
then we also have a program uh called

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,440
email self-defense

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,440
and uh that has its own website you can

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
see that at the bottom of that slide

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,960
which is email selfdefense.fsf.org

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
and that is about bulk surveillance

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,039
mostly in encryption

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,120
um so because block survive surveillance

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,840
really violates our fundamental rights

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,880
and makes it risky for us to practice

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,559
free speech

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,000
we want to make sure that people are

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,679
skilled or have the skills and the

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,799
knowledge to defend themselves against

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,559
this

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,039
and one of the most important things is

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,400
that sometimes people say

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,039
that they don't need this protection

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
because they don't do anything that

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,440
requires for them to protect themselves

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,120
but the idea is that there are actually

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,799
people in this world

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,559
that do need protection whether it is

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:17,200
from governments or whether it is from

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,960
oppressive systems or societal issues

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
that they run into or even in their

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,480
personal lives

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and a lot of people don't have the

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,400
freedoms that we have

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
and to be able to also support those

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
people

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,799
we also need to use encryption and that

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
i think is an argument that people often

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,200
don't

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,840
grasp when it comes to why encryption is

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
important

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,760
we use encryption to protect ourselves

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
but also to protect others

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,360
and email self-defense is really our way

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,240
of

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,600
educating people into what they can do

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,159
to protect themselves and

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,679
others to do that so it's really a

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
step-by-step

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,000
guide to help you set up encryption in

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,760
your email

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,240
um it helps you create a key

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,480
no matter what operating system you run

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,480
and we have a bot in the system

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,520
that can communicate with you whether or

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,440
not your key

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:14,720
is actually working so have a look at it

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,120
and install it it's really

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,640
easy it's really a step-by-step thing

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,320
and if you run into any issues you can

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
always email us as well but we've been

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
running this

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,880
uh guide for a while now and there's a

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,840
lot of people that have used it

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,360
before you so um we've made a lot of

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,440
adaptations

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,520
to make it as simple as possible so that

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,039
anyone of any skill level can go through

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,279
it and really sort of set this up for

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
themselves and or their family members

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,120
um like i said if you run into any

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,760
issues or if you see any issues with the

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
guide

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,679
then you can always email us you can

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,760
also help us by translating this

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,679
guide so it currently has i think about

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,480
14 translations already

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,919
um you can look at the translations

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
check those and work on those but you

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
can also start an entirely new

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,320
translation

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,320
for the country that you're in and that

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,840
way you can help us spread this even

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,080
further

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,200
yeah and just add on that uh one or two

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,480
things um

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
you know something we often hear when we

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
talk about encryption is like well why

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,799
should i use encryption

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,799
if i have nothing to hide right i have

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,840
nothing to hide um but if you think

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,240
about it like

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
our goal with esd in particular and why

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
we encourage encryption

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
as much as possible is that we want to

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,559
just normalize the practice

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559
because you know if everyone was using

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
encryption it would kind of increase the

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,279
protection of the people who really need

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
encryption right because then it would

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
be normalized

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,640
and those people uh wouldn't be singled

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,799
out for using encryption right as all

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,880
this data is passing through the wires

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,840
it's uh intercepted by the nsa and

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
others

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,400
and you know when they when they see an

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,600
encrypted communication that's kind of

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,440
cause for

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,039
uh suspicion on their part you know and

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,080
if it were more normalized

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,039
maybe it wouldn't be so it's always uh

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,240
important to use uh not only email

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,240
encryption but uh

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
hard drive encryption uh if you're able

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,799
to uh just because it normalizes the

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,919
practice and

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,480
actually does i mean quite a lot to um

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,760
defend the uh kind of rights of the

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
people who do really need it you know

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
journalists

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,159
um whistleblowers people of all types

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,799
so uh if you haven't set up a gpg q pair

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
yet

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,200
uh we encourage you to try it um you

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,039
know maybe even email one of us if it's

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,840
set up

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,120
and uh yeah so the esd is a great

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,120
resource i think because uh

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
yeah yeah people uh you know you know

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
you don't have to be especially

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
technical so we hope you'll uh check it

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,120
out

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,200
yeah and last even on that is that even

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,679
if you do have nothing to hide uh

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,919
no one still has a right or a place in

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,840
your communication so

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,840
if protecting others is not a real

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,720
reason uh enough which i think it should

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,600
be then

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,640
also just think about just the fact that

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,320
you have to protect your communication

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,159
alone and if you just ponder on that a

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,480
little bit i think uh encryption becomes

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,039
a very sort of logical

00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:00,240
idea yeah definitely

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,320
um so one uh campaign that we also do is

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,320
the free javascript campaign um

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,240
because actually most pages on the

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,919
internet now uh require these non-free

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,159
software to even function you know so if

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,679
you go to google doc google docs

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,080
you'll end up downloading downloading

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,080
like a 50 megabyte javascript library

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,279
and this is proprietary javascript um

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,880
because even though

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,480
you know at any time you can like right

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,960
click and view the source

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
of the website that you're on uh often

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,120
the javascript that you read is all in

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
like

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,200
one gigantically long line that's like

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,799
you know millions of characters long

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
and not only that but it's obfuscated

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,120
right so they'll run it through an

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
obfuscator to

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
hide what the program is doing and these

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
have gotten so good

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
that they're there's really no

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,679
meaningful difference between

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
this obfuscated javascript code and

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,480
binary so

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,799
as everything kind of moves through the

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,559
browser we run the risk of people

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,000
like using a free operating system like

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,039
any linux but then when they open up

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
their web browser

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,960
they're dependent on proprietary

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,159
software um and that's a real problem

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,840
um because we don't want the web browser

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,760
to become like the number one

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
way that people experience proprietary

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,880
software right it's such a

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,279
kind of ubiquitous part of the web now

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,919
that uh we really want to

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
get uh average users and also website

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,600
developers

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,960
interested in reading their javascript

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,559
and there's also like a lot of free

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,919
software libraries

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,960
javascript libraries that are in use

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,679
today and to those we would encourage

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,919
them to

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,120
label their javascript libraries

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,039
properly

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,399
so that they can be machine read and

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,960
then

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,679
easily kind of filtered out for users

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,559
who

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,760
are concerned about their freedom so we

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,080
encourage site owners to release their

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
javascript under free license

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,480
and the free.js campaign also promotes

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,159
the use of libra.js so library.js

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,520
is a little bit like noscript if you've

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,799
ever used that except

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,399
um it will read the uh javascript source

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,080
of every website that you visit

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,840
and then it'll look for certain headers

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,600
and if it sees this header it'll say oh

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,279
i know this this is under a free license

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
so i'll run this piece of javascript

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,600
but i see this one doesn't have a

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,440
license and it's not trivial you know if

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,120
if javascript is only there to like

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,279
collapse a menu or something

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,279
it's we we think of it as trivial and so

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,880
it's kind of less crucial that that

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,960
becomes free software because it's just

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,480
a one-line piece of code or something

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,600
um but the libra.js will

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
do all this work for you because

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,480
otherwise you would have to just kind of

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,360
go through every source file and see for

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
yourself

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,120
um and it's it's gotten a lot faster

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,559
lately if you've used it before

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,159
so we definitely encourage you to check

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,440
it out and if you're interested

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,640
in um helping us out with labeling your

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,399
own javascript

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,159
uh you can go to the fsf.org page on

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,520
free javascript

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,279
and the same information is also

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,760
available on gnu.org

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,399
if you search for the javascript trap

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,039
which is

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,840
rms's original essay on this a number of

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,840
years ago

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,880
is our uh annual conference on

00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,480
technology and social justice

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,039
we are in our 13th

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,399
edition uh this year last year we had a

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
fully online event

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,799
it is a conference in which we have

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,679
about 40 to 45

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,200
speakers every year uh talking about

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,720
their fields of knowledge

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,399
in the range of whatever touches upon

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,880
free software um

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,120
and so those are people that either are

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
organizers or community members or they

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
are developers and they have their own

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,200
projects

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,640
um and uh those people share their

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
knowledge their knowledge and their

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,919
interest

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,720
and um because of the covet 19 pandemic

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,480
people planet 2020 was held online last

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,799
year in march

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,559
and uh because we don't know what the

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,120
future will bring but we want to be

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,039
safe and make sure that our audience is

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,159
safe as well we have decided that being

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:51,200
attended 22

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,640
our 2021 will also be held online in

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
march next year

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,799
um so we are currently in preparations

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,799
of that and our call for speakers is

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,000
open right now and you can still submit

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
your presentation for this year's

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,640
conference at peopleplanet.org

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,519
2021 and the theme for this year is

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,120
empowering

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,480
users um

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,880
what we saw in the pandemic is that a

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
lot of people got together and started

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
working

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,440
on solutions whether it was sewing their

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,600
own masks or other ppe

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,600
um whether it was um

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,080
developing um faster on

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,120
video conferencing possibilities or even

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,960
if it was just about

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,559
sharing information our new tenant.org

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,720
website is a network where a lot of

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,039
people can come together and on that we

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,799
also had a remote communication

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,399
site that just became bigger and bigger

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,960
and bigger which was an amazing thing to

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,679
see where

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,039
the community added information on tools

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,039
that you can use that are actually

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,640
respectful of your

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,640
freedom that you can use in

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,320
having to live and work remotely things

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,760
like that

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,440
as well as people really

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
using their expertise and sharing their

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,240
expertise in different fields

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,000
to find ways to uh go against the

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,840
pandemic or protect themselves from the

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,760
pedentic or educate people

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,519
uh was really something that inspired us

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,840
and from there we

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,120
really thought to ourselves what is it

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,159
that brings

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,600
um that is like at the core of free

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,760
software right now and that is really

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,080
this empowering users is having

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,840
for users to have and take the power to

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,399
stand up for themselves and protect

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,159
their rights and uh really get things

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,080
done because that's really what they did

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,720
over the past year and that was amazing

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,760
to see and we want to hear from

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,519
you if you have anything to say

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,880
uh whether it is pandemic related or not

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,960
free software is really all about taking

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,080
the power into your own hands and and

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,240
developing

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,120
on that and we want to hear your story

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,720
if you uh have something to say

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,800
yeah for sure

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,839
oh high priority projects that's also me

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,359
i'm

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,359
sorry um so we um

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,119
got together a committee of free

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,079
software luminaries

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,879
uh the campaign team manages the high

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,760
priority free software projects lists

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,599
but we do not own it and we do not make

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,200
the final decisions when it comes to

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,320
what is added and what is not

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,320
added there are currently

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,079
a range of projects that are already on

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,399
the list and then this was last updated

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,679
i think somewhere in 2017

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,159
um and uh examples of what is on there

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,320
is

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,679
free captcha tools or free video

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,159
conferencing platforms

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,879
uh decentralized social media and things

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,679
like that

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,639
they're really it's really about what we

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,520
feel

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,440
or what the community feels that free

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,640
software organizations and developers

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,000
and also

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,400
funders or donors should focus on

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,760
when they invest into pushing free

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,800
software forward

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,400
and we have opened the

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,520
call for submissions and we really want

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:17,040
to hear from everyone

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,839
please email hpp feedback canoe.org and

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
let us know

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,440
what you think is important for people

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
to focus on and what should be the

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,800
things that we highlight when it comes

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,400
to projects that can really sort of

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,320
define the future of free software um

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,000
we are running the submissions until

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,839
january you can still submit

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,200
after that uh it's just that our

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,800
committee at some point has to start

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,640
reviewing everything that comes in

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,040
and they will do this in january and

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,640
february and then the idea is to

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,280
launch a new list and have a

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
presentation at steve planet 2021 in

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,599
march

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,880
of uh next year right yeah just to add

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,000
to that real quick i mean the high

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,359
priority projects list

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,960
if you're you know a very talented

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,440
programmer or something it kind of

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
exists

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,680
to say like if say you know person a

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,599
who's a very talented programmer

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,119
um really gets interested in free

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,440
software and they want to help out you

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,440
know

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,880
lending their development skills they

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,040
could look at the high priority projects

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,720
list to say like okay like where is free

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,359
software really

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,400
badly needed um and the list would be

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,800
there to provide them

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,800
uh suggestions on what to what to

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,359
develop and what to assist with

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,480
so it's really just a way of kind of

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,079
taking a

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,680
i guess a litmus test of the free

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,040
software movement um

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
because we know that we've come so far

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,520
you know we know that people can

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,880
use their uh computer without using

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
proprietary software at all but there

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,480
are some aspects of life where they're

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,119
definitely still experiencing pressure

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,040
to use proprietary software uh we

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,320
even we get it at the fsf every day you

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,240
know if we're working with another

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,599
organization and they want us to like

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,119
electronically sign a document or

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,119
something we can't do it because

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,720
it requires time for javascript so uh

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,359
there are really a lot of aspects like

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,839
this

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,960
and it isn't hard to think of them if

00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,240
you um

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,079
if you think really carefully just

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,960
because uh you know if you're using any

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,560
kind of

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
tool that you don't know of a proprietor

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,680
or a free solution for

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,079
then you can send it to hpp feedback

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,839
because

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
you know maybe a good candidate for the

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,000
list

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,240
and uh something else the fsf also does

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
at least planet is give out the free

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,880
software awards

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,880
we've been doing this i think since

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,200
before there was a libra planet

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,160
um but it's our way of recognizing

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,359
individuals

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,119
and also free software projects who

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,400
have done something significant for the

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
free software community

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
or alternatively have applied the

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,440
principles

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,200
of the free software community to some

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,320
other field of endeavor for example like

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,839
a hospital

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,560
that runs on free software or something

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,160
like that and the three categories are

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,359
the award for the advancement of free

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,520
software so this one

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,839
is a uh a kind of technological award so

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,920
if there's a particular person who is

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,119
uh you know pioneered a project that is

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,079
that is uh

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,520
given a lot of benefit to uh everyone in

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,119
the free software community

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,560
um you know some past winners include

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,440
larry wall who wrote the pearl program

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
language

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,880
uh yukihiro matsumoto who wrote the ruby

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,160
programming language so

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
these big kind of uh watershed uh

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,480
programs

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,240
in the free software movement uh that's

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,160
kind of what the award for the

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,160
advancement of free software exists to

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
recognize next one is the award for

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,280
projects of social benefit so this is

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,800
kind of what i mentioned with the

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,079
hospital scenario but it's

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,720
really um a award to recognize people

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,560
who

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
do some other kind of social good other

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,320
than fight for free software

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,480
but use the principles of free software

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,880
or use free software programs

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,520
uh extensively in their work so one

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,640
example

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,560
uh was uh the openstreetmaps

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,760
uh group which was awarded two years ago

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,000
because they're you know kind of

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,400
democratizing access to map data

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,560
which otherwise uh would be locked

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,520
behind a restrictive license

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
and we debuted a new category last year

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,720
which is the award for the outstanding

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,240
new free software contributor so if

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,760
there's a person

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
in your free software community or

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,480
project you know it could be like

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320
somebody on your

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,880
distributions forum or it could be

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,520
somebody who just got involved with

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,079
some program that you're involved with

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,839
are running

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,000
um and if they've like really made great

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,200
strides uh in the last year so you know

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,560
like hit the ground running in terms of

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,920
the work that they do

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,240
um and in terms of uh just being a kind

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
of

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,720
good uh role model for people in the

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,480
free software movement both ones that

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,400
have been around longer than they have

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,240
and ones that have been around less than

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,880
they have we'd really like to hear from

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,680
them

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,119
get your nominations for the award that

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
category

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,560
so the nominations are still open

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,040
they're going to be open until november

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,119
11th and if you'd like to nominate

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,599
someone just go to

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,839
fsf.org awards um the way that it works

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,839
is uh we read all the nominations and

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,119
then these go to a committee

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,400
of past award winners who will grant the

00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,200
award and then they're traditionally

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
given out

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,359
at library planet in boston um but since

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,280
we're going

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,839
online this year we'll have a creative

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,839
way to award people so don't worry about

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
that

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,640
uh mobile phone freedom is actually also

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,599
a high priority project if i say this

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,839
correctly um

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,200
it was listed on the high priority free

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,640
software projects list because mobile

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
phone freedom of course

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,160
is one of the major things that should

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,119
be on our radars when

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,599
talking about free software we currently

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,160
have

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,319
the opportunity and the possibility to

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
have fully free operating systems or

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,000
even

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,240
fully free biases and computers um

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,200
running only free software when it comes

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,680
to laptops

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,319
and desktops but it is uh not somewhere

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,040
where we are

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,960
yet when it comes to the mobile phone so

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,839
um

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,440
of course we want to move into this

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,359
field and we want to develop

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,040
um or help stimulate the development of

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,720
operating systems and mobile phone

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,200
freedom

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,319
um android is normally free software but

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,240
almost always ships

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,599
with non-free google libraries and

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
non-free drivers

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,520
we recommend using the replicant

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,040
distribution of the distribution of

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,560
androids to make sure your freedom is

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,040
protected

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,480
so that's one of the projects that we

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,480
are also

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,599
is also in our working together program

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,119
replicant is

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,119
um an important project that is

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,720
is moving forward and they've done some

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,280
really amazing things in the past

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,640
and they still are moving um quite

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,200
progressively

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,119
forward and i know that they um made

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,640
some big steps last year we

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,839
had uh dennis also published something

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,920
through our website

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,520
um on his update so if you want to read

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,720
the latest and that's

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,319
also on the fsf.org website um i also

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,079
know that they also update their

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,359
replicant website with information on

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,800
where they are and what's developing

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,040
there and how you can help

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,680
um so have a look at that then of course

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,000
the pure there's purism tourism 5 is

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,040
very

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,359
promising and looks very sleek as well

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,680
but we haven't had a chance to review it

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,599
for ref certifications they have

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,480
submitted so we will be looking into

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,480
that and we do know that it runs pure os

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,599
which is an fsf approved distribution of

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,839
new linux

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,680
these are uh two ways that um

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,880
sort of give us hope and there are

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,240
positive developments

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,920
uh in the mobile phone fields but it's

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,880
definitely something we need to make

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,200
sure that we keep

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,440
updating and keeping our radar and if

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,160
you have any knowledge or understanding

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,680
here then

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,599
reach out to these projects to see if

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,760
you can help

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,280
yeah definitely and then if you uh

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,720
already have an android phone you don't

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,520
have to be running

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,200
you know a custom rom or anything to

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,400
download the f droid

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,359
uh store which is a repository of only

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,200
free software

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,960
packages for android we we use it at the

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,000
fsf for our phones

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,440
um but uh yeah it's just a great way to

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
get started on

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,319
you know using free software especially

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,960
on your mobile phone you know because if

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,680
there's

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,800
a google app that you use uh you know

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,359
chances are that there's

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,880
an f droid app that could replace its

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,560
functionality um

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,960
i know my personal phone while it

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,760
doesn't run fully free software does run

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,880
uh fully free has no google libraries

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,440
and it runs fully free

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
applications um so f droid really has

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,960
like a wide range of

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,160
of programs that you can choose from so

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,520
if you haven't checked it out

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,520
i definitely encourage you to do that

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,960
um and one thing we also like to

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,920
encourage this is another

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,640
uh hyperbolic project um or at least

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,760
from the

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,240
2017 list and is the kind of step

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,920
that uh we like to encourage people to

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,160
take when it comes to

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,960
living a more freedom-minded digital

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,800
life

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,359
is being discriminate about

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,960
um the social media that they're on and

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,040
which kind of tools that they use

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,960
um so here it's important to clarify

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,440
that network services like twitter

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,119
they're neither free nor non-free

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,960
because they're not really

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,400
being distributed to users as a service

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,599
they might be distributing their user

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,280
software

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,640
typically in the form of like a non-free

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,160
javascript

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,480
page that you use to post on twitter or

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,119
something so this is a slightly separate

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,440
issue from

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,400
free software versus non-free software

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,240
but we still like to encourage people to

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,640
to use federated social media because

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,119
often you know the server side software

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,560
of programs like mastodon or peertube

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,520
are free software

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,160
um and they often kind of align more

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,200
with

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,240
freedom-minded ideas ideals than the

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,400
alternative

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,520
so we really encourage these to avoid

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,480
centralization

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,119
and corporate surveillance so uh just a

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,200
range of

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,920
free software uh federated social media

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,319
platforms we recommend our mastodon

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,200
uh gnu social and pluroma which are all

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,480
compatible with

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,760
activity pub um and we ourselves have

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,960
been taking some strides in this

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,560
recently

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,560
we signed up for a peer tube account

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,280
which is a federated alternative to

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,400
youtube

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,520
so the fsf has an account on the

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,400
frimasoft instance um who create

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,960
youtube um and so through our account we

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,000
can then

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,280
reach everyone else on peertube um

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
no matter what instance they're on

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,319
because it's federated um so this is

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,040
like a great way to

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,720
kind of bust people out of siloed

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,200
services like youtube

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,319
um because you know i can have my own

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,839
instance if i wanted to

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,200
but i could still see the episode videos

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,000
they could still see mine if i uploaded

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,079
them

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,319
um so it's really kind of like it kind

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,839
of is a way of translating the

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,359
uh community principles of the free

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,000
software movement into a into

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,839
the space of social media um and if you

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,880
want to find our peer tutor account uh

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,160
the url is below

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,560
uh lately we've been publishing some uh

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,359
videos from our anniversary celebration

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,000
which we did

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,560
at the beginning of october um and we're

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,160
also

00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,520
distributing the animated videos there

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,400
so hopefully if you're on pier 2 you

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,560
might see it

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,560
on your timeline in the near future

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,920
and remote education and free video

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,760
conferencing so

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
you know obviously in the pandemic we're

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
all transitioning to

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,040
remote methods of work in education like

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,599
zoe and i are not in ohio right now

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,720
we're in boston massachusetts um so

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,040
we're you know using

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,160
free software you know often we're using

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,520
on-free software

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,960
to uh communicate with people um and

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,200
so that's that's not good you know

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,560
because if if your work life now depends

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,079
on non-free software

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,119
that's a problem and if your education

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,760
is being funneled through non-free

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,839
software

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,640
that's also a problem and education is

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,160
one we've particularly targeted recently

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,000
we launched a petition against the use

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,560
of proprietary software in education

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,960
particularly remote education

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,760
and we're using the information that we

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,520
collect

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,800
to approach schools and invite them into

00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,400
a discussion about the importance of

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
software freedom so if you go to sign

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,800
the petition

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,720
which you can still do um the uh we ask

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,800
you if you want to provide us

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,560
with contact information for schools and

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
if you do that we'll contact

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,240
them on your behalf and say you know a

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,359
concerned person

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,480
uh says that you require microsoft teams

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,400
for example to

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,599
to participate in school this is a

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
problem because it's proprietary

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,160
software

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,240
uh you know have you considered using

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,359
big button etc so we would

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,240
um be encouraging people to

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,599
use those to explore alternatives to the

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,280
proprietary software that they may be

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,400
using

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,119
and we kind of put our own efforts into

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,079
this because

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,040
the fsf tech team has also helped the

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,960
mit professor

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,160
and episode board member gerald j

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
sussman uh

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,319
transition his classes to a fully free

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
setup based on big blue button uh if

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,960
you'll notice bigbluebutton is the

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,200
program that we're using

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,559
actually using to record this uh streams

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,040
on so it's actually pretty

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,640
uh diverse in what it can do you can

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,599
manage classes it can do all kinds of

00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,839
stuff really

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,040
so our write-up of this can be found on

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,319
the gnu website

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,960
at the address below so we really hope

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,340
that

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,559
you'll kind of consider the use of

00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,839
[Music]

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,599
free software tools when it comes to

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,119
your video conferencing needs

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,280
and also if you're an fsf associate

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,720
member uh we have a

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,480
fully free jitsi meet uh server server

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,440
that you can use um you know you just

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,440
sign in

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,800
uh you can call you can use it to set up

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
a room and then the other person that

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,160
you talk to

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,200
they don't have to be an fsf member um

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,720
it's just kind of

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,559
doing our part you know using our like

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,520
technical expertise and our server

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,640
expertise

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,680
to um yeah give people a free

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,760
alternative to

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,079
uh you know zoom calls for instance

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,119
which nobody likes being on so

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,800
um yeah we're uh really

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,040
really excited about that and we're also

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,520
um you know doing whatever we can to

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,559
promote

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,559
uh free methods of remote education and

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,640
talking to one another

00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,359
yeah and i think when it comes to

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,160
education uh gerald stutzman he works

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,880
not only with

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,680
big blue button but also with canvas

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,720
which is

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,160
um also free software and they the

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,760
which is a blackboard system and

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,040
particularly for education i think it's

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,160
important to note

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,440
that it is actually possible to have an

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,359
educational program

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,240
running on non-proprietary software

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,800
um so if you are an educational instance

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,319
or a student anywhere then

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,559
take a note of that and make sure that

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,960
you communicate with your organization

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,640
or with your um

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,880
educational institution about the

00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,480
software that they make you use

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
yeah definitely and this is another case

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,480
where normalizing the practice

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,920
will help it kind of catch on you know

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,000
the first few schools

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,680
to take uh this step you know often

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,559
they're places like mit who are very

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,559
technical

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,680
um but the more people we can get into a

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,160
community of

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,800
uh users and school administrators and

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,160
teachers

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,440
who are using free software to conduct

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,559
their remote classes i mean the more

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,559
normal it's going to get

00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,599
and also the larger the support network

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,160
is going to get

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,440
um so even if you have like a very tiny

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,359
school you know even if you're from a

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,720
very small town any kind of step

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,720
in this direction is a good one because

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,000
you're not only freeing um

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,839
you know yourself potentially but you're

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,960
also giving freedom to you know students

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,559
potentially like

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,960
all over the world so it's very

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,960
important

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,599
and each year we also publish a given

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,359
guide so

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,720
when doing holiday shopping it's often

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,000
difficult to find devices if not

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,119
impossible to find devices

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,720
that are freedom respecting so each year

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,200
we help people out by

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,559
publishing our latest recommendations on

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,839
computer hardware and other gadgets so

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,559
these can include mobile phones for

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,680
example

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,559
laptops really anything that runs

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,200
software to a substantial degree we

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,200
address it

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,319
in the given guide and so this year's

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,520
update isn't ready yet

00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,000
but it will be published in late

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,119
november but you can view the 2019

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,400
giving guided that link and really it's

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,480
our recommendations for

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,520
uh how best to live a free life when it

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,000
comes to

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,359
hardware that you use so uh all the fsf

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,640
employees will use

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:08,000
typically the uh nx200 thinkpad uh

00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,119
with libre boot um which is mentioned on

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,240
the giving guide

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,000
um and yeah it gives our like really

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,079
what we know you know how free things

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,079
are um and the tools that we can like

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,839
definitely recommend at this point so

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,839
check it out if you haven't yet

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,960
volunteer uh we have gone through a

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,680
bunch of things of course that

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,599
we think that you can do to either help

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,520
us or other organizations

00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,800
um when it comes to carrying your weight

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,640
in the free software world

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,079
or in the free software community it

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,920
happens a lot that we run into people

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,520
that just go and come to us and they go

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,960
how can i help what can i do

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,720
so i think if you go through this

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,400
presentation you can find a lot of

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,880
different ways that we can help

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,720
uh that we can use your help whether it

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,880
is submitting translations for the

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
videos or for the email self defense

00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,920
guide

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,960
or even just installing uh encryption on

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,200
your email server

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,160
things like that will all of those

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,280
things help

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,920

um there are things that happen where we

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,359
need extra people so we can then email

we have um i don't know if i made this

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,440
clear enough in the beginning but

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,359
liberal planets

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,520
is both a network and a conference and

00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,040
liberalplanet.org

00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,440
is our network website and

00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,880
legalplanets.org

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,599
2021 is our conference website and on

00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,760
the network

00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,800
website you can find other community

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,640
members

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,559
and teams and groups of people that you

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,640
can connect with all over the world

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,319
and that can be part of your group of

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,200
local organizers

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,640
we run we run the naval fanatic for

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,280
exactly this purpose

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,040
um we want to give people a place for

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,800
and local groups also a place to

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,839
collaborate and organize actions for

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,800
themselves

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,160
if you do uh have a group have an id for

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,480
a group or have an

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,839
idea for an action within your group we

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,760
are always on the other side of

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,760
campaigns at fsf.org

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:33,040
to help you either communicate

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
your message um share your information

00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,800
or whatever

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,160
action it is that you are developing and

00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,599
of course to answer any questions that

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,480
you might have

00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,240
we currently are still not allowed to

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
have in-person events so we don't want

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,680
to motivate

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,319
anyone to have in-person events but once

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,640
we do

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,760
again the fsf wants to make sure that we

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,640
can support

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,319
local organization and activism and so

00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,240
we will then launch

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,240
a program to help people

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:07,520
get their expenses back uh for a part

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,119
or for a whole it depends a little bit

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,920
on what you're organizing and

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,400
how much of it we actually can take on

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,760
um

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,359
so we um want to just

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,359
tell everyone to find like-minded people

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,920
and start local groups and organizations

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,000
and

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,200
if you're interested in knowing more

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,400
about this you can email us

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,880
as well definitely

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
so one other way that you can support

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,720
the fsf

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,319
and actually the main way you can

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,400
support the msf financially is through

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,400
an associate membership

00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,079
it's the bulk of our revenue it helps us

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,559
stay independent and focused on our

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,599
mission

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,040
uh it's very important for us um

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,880
you know financially but it also is the

00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,440
show of uh support for the free software

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,640
movement

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,880
or at least our work in the free

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,160
software movement um so we really

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,920
appreciate you know every single

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,359
associate member that we have

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,160
and it also nets you a lot of great

00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,079
benefits um access to our jc meat server

00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,000
which i mentioned previously

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,920
the member forum and also we'll send you

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,799
in the mail a bootable

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,160
usb card with triskel getting linux

00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,119
pre-installed so you can either run it

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,040
from the card

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,640
or install it to a separate computer

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,400
and this is just a few of them there are

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,760
actually many other benefits

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,240
so many that i forget some of them

00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,520
