well i wouldn't say that you're tearing

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,639
me away from

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,960
the information for all program uh

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,080
i think you were actually referring to

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,600
the igf

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,160
the internet governance forum which is

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
um another conference running this

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
weekend next week

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,359
um but probably we'll get to talk about

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
that

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,079
later um yes at the moment i

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,600
am the chair of unesco's information for

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,120
all program

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,719
and it's um very interesting because

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
it's an

00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,800
intergovernmental council so it's made

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,480
up of member states

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
and some of the people do tease me

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,600
that here you are somebody who's been

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,719
working with civil society

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
for a lot of your life and with the un

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,440
and now member states have asked you to

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,239
take on this role but

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,199
it's a great opportunity uh in the last

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,720
session

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,960
um sff was discussing

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
um the challenges that we have in

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
education today

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,320
it's a kind of new scramble that is

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,080
going

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,240
on uh for the education space

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,280
and to tie in educators into proprietary

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
platforms

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,439
that will eventually have huge

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,479
implications for education

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
budgets you know so um

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
there are so many issues that we have to

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,799
address

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,560
as a community as a global community

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and um one of the things that unesco

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,520
got approved by all member states is

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,399
the room indicators that

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
our internet should be rights-based it

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,000
should be

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,159
open it should be accessible and it

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,600
should be multi-stakeholder

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,799
and when we see these global challenges

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
such as what happens to education

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,360
under rapid digitization

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
then we really need to have that

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,720
multi-stakeholder dialogue

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,280
that would involve civil society actors

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
such as

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,440
sff and of course um

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
you know uh many of the people who are

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,160
attending

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,280
um the ohio linux fest

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,280
and i was just thrilled to hear that

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,440
ohio is um so advanced that it has

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,720
a live express as you know

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,160
i i recently joined the board of the

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,760
lineups professional institute and

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
uh for more than 20 years penguins have

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,599
been

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,599
my dearest pets

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,519
oh great i i did notice uh over

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,720
um my social networks that you

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,000
have joined the lpi

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,800
as a born member how is that

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,319
important specifically to your part of

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
the world

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,560
the collaborations with lpi

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,080
well um it's extremely

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,440
important that's a short answer uh

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,840
basically while we've had many

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,440
open source enthusiasts on the continent

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,159
um if i were to be very candid

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,959
i would say that we haven't received

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,799
enough

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,280
attention from some of the lead

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,120
organizations that

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
work in this area and so it's been a

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
struggle to

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,560
get certifications uh when i was heading

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,640
up uh the ghana india kofi annan center

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,760
of excellence and ict

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,200
we reached out to many of the leaders

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,680
in open source software

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
because we knew that if people got

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
trained

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,720
on their software then there would be a

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,879
greater take up

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,079
within the countries but um for many

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,560
i think they had kind of absorbed

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,840
um how could i say it diplomatically

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,840
um let's say they had

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,040
absorbed the normal storyline about

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,680
africa they were afraid to get involved

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,240
they didn't see it as a market and

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
meanwhile now everybody is waking up to

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,440
the fact that by

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,840
2050 um we're going to be

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,479
we're going to have the bulk of young

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
people

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
on the planet and probably going to be

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,840
the largest market

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,880
uh but for lpi um

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,040
i think that their presence in

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
africa and they've always had a global

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,639
vision

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,720
um but i think it takes more time to

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
form the relationships in different

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,400
places

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,520
uh i was just talking to um

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
one of the phosphor leadership the other

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
day

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
and they were telling me the difference

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
that open source

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
made in their life the fact that they

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,639
were

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,919
able to acquire skills

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,360
the fact that they didn't have to become

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,400
broke in order to equip their

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,919
office um when we

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,919
look at the

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,120
situation today where so many people

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,400
are having to um incorporate

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
new tools into their work you can see

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,240
that

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,800
open source solutions offer

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
a great deal for africa because they

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
allow

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,240
us to address those

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,639
how can i put it let's just look at

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,840
health and the kind of solutions that

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,080
you need in health

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,919
um you can imagine what that does to a

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,960
government budget

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,120
uh if you're going for exclusively

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,720
proprietary solutions

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
and in so many sectors now you're going

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,880
to

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,000
have to have the software which kind of

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,560
software

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
so when you look at lpi and the fact

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,000
that lpi

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,199
has always had uh a motive

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,479
of delivering certification

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,000
that is accessible to as many people

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,479
as possible and um

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
the design of the certifications at the

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,919
moment

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,639
from your lineups essential through to

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,919
your

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,280
various flavors of the lpic

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
means that people have the opportunity

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,680
to

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,520
actually be recognized as professionals

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,639
and when we have professional

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,199
software developers or

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
system administrators on the continent

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,000
it just makes it that much

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,840
easier to run our own systems

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
and if you are

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,240
educated in

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,120
open source software that means

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,720
that you have an understanding of how

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
that software works

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
you have an understanding of how you can

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
build

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
new solutions on that and i think i'm

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,599
preaching to the converted here

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
everybody knows

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,400
the value of open source so

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
uh i can just say that the linux

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,879
professional

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,199
institute really offers that opportunity

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
to

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,360
grow professionals in linux

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
on the continent

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:04,400
i think we have about 180

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,919
000 um professionals

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,639
in over 180 countries and we can only

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
hope

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,840
that that number is going to grow

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,680
exponentially in

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,440
africa absolutely

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,800
it is important to network

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,000
with others who

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,720
are motivated to work in free

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
software and i know that you touched on

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,680
this um

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,800
a little bit but how

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,240
powerful is free software in resolving

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,159
the digital divide

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:48,320
well that is um a difficult question

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,040
to answer we have a lot of potential

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
power

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,240
of free software to address digital

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
divide issues

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
but the people who need it most often

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
don't know

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,640
enough about that and that applies even

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,000
in um more tech ready societies

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:12,320
such as the us and

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
for most people i've noticed that

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,560
just saying the word source code and

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,160
their brain goes

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,360
off um they they they don't want to

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,480
think about the technology that they use

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,320
in those terms they

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,880
um so they don't understand

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080
the differentiation very often i think

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
we we can do

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,240
better in terms of explaining the

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,200
differentiation between

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
free software and proprietary software

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,519
and that has become

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,480
far more complex today because so much

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,519
of the software that is used by major

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,800
platforms

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,839
is actually open source but

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
it's being used in what they would

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,920
recognize

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,120
as just a big company selling them a

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,560
solution

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,839
so we don't have the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,200
the uptake that we would like when it

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,120
comes to

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:17,360
um free software and

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,839
um i'm very happy that we're

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
quite a number of civil society

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,480
organizations that's what we call them

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,680
in the u.n but i think in the u.s

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,120
they like to call them pbos

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,560
am i right what is the terminology in

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,360
the us

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,800
there's the community development

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,920
organizations perhaps or

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,600
just not for profit you can find

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,160
something like fsf or lpi

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,279
what would you call them oh they're

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
they're definitely not

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,720
for profits okay not for profit so there

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,040
are a lot of not-for-profits

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,160
um that are getting to know how to use

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,160
uh free software for example

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,839
um particularly applications like

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,440
os geo that help us in so many different

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,959
fields they help up with surveys etc

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,399
but um i think that we

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,839
really need to have far more systematic

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,240
education

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
that will address the needs of different

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,040
sectors

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,519
and um we need to work on our outreach

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
and our advocacy and understand what

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,800
messaging

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,560
works for the different communities that

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,519
we want to reach out to

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,560
so open source software has huge

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,920
potential

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,680
impact and it's

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,040
at the same time having a huge

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,200
impact right now but it's hidden

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,240
and people don't understand that

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,519
distinction

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,279
i don't know if you agree with me

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:06,639
well i i do agree with you i think that

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,000
there is a confusion between gratis and

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
free software

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,920
particularly in the developed world but

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,760
i think

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,600
that you you might have something to say

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,279
about certain inconsistencies

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,760
on communities that

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,519
try to be about free software but are

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,920
not

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,200
necessarily using free software all the

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,200
time

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,760
i think you're referring to the fact

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,079
that i sent you a tough

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:43,440
email asking why you were using slack

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:47,120
i i i think that um it's

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,800
good if we promote

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,800
free software that as much as possible

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,120
we use free software especially when we

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,399
have

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,000
great solutions for doing the same thing

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:05,200
there's no real excuse in my

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,480
in my mind for using um

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
a closed solution where

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
when you have open solutions that can do

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,720
the job

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,000
and that by using those open solutions

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,560
you are actually

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,480
doing your advocacy so um uh

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,720
as you know you met me at the ghana

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,160
india kofi annan center of excellence

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,200
and technology and um

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,320
while we were there we made sure that

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,399
all our systems back back-end front-end

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,680
whatever were exclusively open source

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,800
the only time we use closed source

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
is if we had been hired to teach a

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,279
particular

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,360
proprietary package and in this way

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
we were able to demonstrate that it's

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,959
entirely possible

00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,399
to run an institution within governments

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,440
that does that and of course it did not

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,959
make

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,880
certain people happy because while at

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,240
the same time we don't have many

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,440
open source companies um

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,880
reaching out to africa we do

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,079
have in the corridors of ministries

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,920
very seasoned marketers for

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,120
uh proprietary solutions and

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,440
you know some people argue well you are

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,480
never going to get that traction

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,240
but i think that today people

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,600
are recognizing that our technology

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,040
ecosystem

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,639
needs some serious rethinking if we are

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,760
going to build

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,399
the kind of future we want as humanity

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
and if we're going to promote the values

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,440
that we hold dear

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,680
so i'm hoping that all of this

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
um upheaval as a result of the pandemic

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,040
this

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,160
year will get people to start thinking

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,160
about how we can

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,600
um highlight

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,720
the value of free software

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,720
the value of the collaboration the human

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,160
values that are behind the whole idea

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,000
of free software um and we can

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,240
um build on that to build a better

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
society and that's the kind of thing

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,639
that unesco is about

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:41,839
that we are trying to build a peaceful

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,839
and um value-driven society

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,880
beth

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,000
hello

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,519
uh i i think beth's phone probably

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,480
stopped working

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,480
beth are you still there

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,000
well you can ask me a question while

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:11,519
we're waiting for her

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
sure um um you know living where you are

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,360
living

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,480
um and the experience that you have

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,079
um is there any major difference that

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,880
you have seen

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,880
from the perspective of developed

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
societies compared to developing

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
societies and

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,160
if there's a difference in attitude of

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,160
people towards

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,160
open source software and free tools

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,759
you know frankly

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,800
when i talk to people who are not

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,920
techies whether it is

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,000
in the uk in europe

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,519
and very often in paris because of the

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,519
unesco work

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,639
um let me say let me let me

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,759
say that what i find is europeans

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,319
are far more aware perhaps

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
but in the uk i don't find them very

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,120
aware

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,400
and in the u.s when i speak to my um

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,559
maybe i can call them civilian friends

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,679
um non-techies they haven't a clue

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,480
you know so when i'm talking about

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,959
um the privacy issues you know everybody

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,880
followed cambridge analytica

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
but the implications of cambridge

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
analytica for how they behave

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
on their devices they don't get that at

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
all

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,080
i mean i'm using that as an example that

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,200
is

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,240
has received so much media attention

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,400
so free software it's

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,760
too um should we say philosophical

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,919
esoteric

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,520
it doesn't seem to be something that

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,559
they relate to

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,679
at all uh in general so

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,039
um i'm not seeing that differentiation

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:05,120
uh when i watched the senate

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,400
hearings um and interviews with tech

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,559
leaders

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
i saw that the same problems that i

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,840
observe in africa

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,799
in terms of an awareness of our

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,320
leadership of

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,360
the technology issues are also very

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,760
real in other parts of the world you

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,679
know

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,559
so uh we have a huge amount of education

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,120
to do

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
around these issues and i think that we

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,720
have to

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,000
figure out how we can market the whole

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
thing better

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
and how we can take it out of tech

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,039
communities

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,000
and um one of the things that i've

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,280
noticed

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
that we could do is and this one

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,480
is one of the things that lpi the linux

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,400
professional institute will be doing

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
is to form partnerships with

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
universities

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,600
and not just people who are studying

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,080
computer science and universities uh

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
reach

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,480
out to the entire younger population

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,400
who are following courses in university

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
and give them the opportunity to get

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,880
certifications to get

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,799
to understand which software makes sense

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,000
for them i was just talking to an

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,160
architect

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
and he was saying that how much of a

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,880
difference open source solutions

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,919
have made to his work good to see you

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,919
back that

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,960
i was worried well it's great to be

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,400
back um whenever i was a part

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,520
of the deployment the most

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,679
requested piece of software that we

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,640
forgot to bundle into our distribution

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,640
happen to be

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,000
um a cad

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,110
software which there is a

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
um free software for

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,640
[Music]

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,480
computer aided drafting as well

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,360
as planning electricity

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,600
so um it was something that we were able

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,679
to to patch on the fly

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,799
but i definitely agree that it

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:19,120
you do need to consider

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:22,320
free software for all sorts of

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,240
problems of human endeavor

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,159
and not just um for the computer science

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,559
students listening to you

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,400
it just occurred to me that i could do

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,559
something about that

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,640
um by maybe uh crowdsourcing

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,720
so that it could be that it already

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
exists somewhere and i just don't know

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,679
it but if we go through

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,120
the 17 sustainable development goals

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:53,120
we could identify the free software

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:56,080
that helps you achieve each of those 17

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,799
um sustainable development goals we

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,159
usually refer to them as like sdgs

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,080
so whether it's that would be amazing

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
yeah whether it is in health whether it

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,559
is any in education

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,679
whether it is uh to promote gender

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,840
equality

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,120
we could have all the different

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,000
softwares

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,440
that are available for that and then we

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
would have to link

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,799
to how you can get yourself trained on

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
that

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,120
and i think that that that could be uh

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,919
you know very very useful uh whether it

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
is for somebody who has been looking

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,240
after kids

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,360
for five years and is looking to

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,919
enter a different profession um

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,200
you know and would like to get trained

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,400
and certified

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,640
on uh the you know

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,120
different packages i don't know which

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,320
but i'm sure she would start with an lpi

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:57,039
certification or whether it is for a

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,039
professional um who

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,200
is looking to expand their office and is

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
looking at

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,679
some very serious costs related to

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,400
proprietary software

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
and you know we do tend to get tied up

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
in this cost

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,200
issue and um

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,000
the fact is that that's not the most

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,880
important

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
issue it's the capacity building issue

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
and

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,799
um at the moment i've been talking a lot

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,720
about

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:30,720
the introduction of new dependencies

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,760
as a result of the rapid digitization

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,240
during this pandemic period

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
and um the thing about

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,640
open source software is it

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,760
really gives you the power back

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
you know you are no longer tied in and

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,240
dependent

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,520
on somebody's uh solution

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,360
so uh because you can take it apart

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,559
build on it etc etc so i think that

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,440
um having something like this

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,360
uh would be very good and i promise i

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,240
will start working on it and

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,679
for me i'm always happy when i have um

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,640
interaction

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,320
i realize we've spent almost half the

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
time already i don't know if we're going

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,840
to be taking questions

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,840
but this interaction has been very

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
valuable to me because it gave me this

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,880
idea

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
yeah well you heard it first here at

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
open

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,440
libra free that dorothy gordon calls

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
upon

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,320
all of us hackers to

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,159
check out the sustainable

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:48,000
development goals which will

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,440
attack the world's problems especially

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,720
ones pertaining to

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,159
to poverty in a way that

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,679
is um good for the environment and good

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:04,159
for free software

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,159
