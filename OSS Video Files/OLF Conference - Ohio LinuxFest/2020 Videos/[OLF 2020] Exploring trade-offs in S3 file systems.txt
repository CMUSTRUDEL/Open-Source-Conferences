Many Linux user-space file systems (FUSE) layer on top of S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) to allow existing applications to use scalable storage without rewriting. These work well for many applications but for others compare unfavorably to NFS. Performance of some operations can differ an order of magnitude while other operations cannot be implemented at all. In this talk, we explore the trade-offs between s3fs, goofys, and s3ql including performance, interoperability, and POSIX compatibility.
