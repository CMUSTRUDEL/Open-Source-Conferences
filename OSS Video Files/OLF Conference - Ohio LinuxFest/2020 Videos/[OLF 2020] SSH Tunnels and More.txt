SSH is the go to tool for sysadmins and developers for interactive connections to remote machines. It creates secure, encrypted connections between computers, even across hostile networks. Unless you accept keys without verification (DONâ€™T DO THAT!!!).

SSH can also create tunnels for encapsulating other connections, including other protocols and data. Sysadmins can bridge protocols across networks for ease of access such as a one-off data sync. Devs can present the dev database on their desktop to ease use of graphical development tools.

After attending this session, audience members will be able to create a local tunnel from client to server, a remote tunnel from server to client, and do simple analysis of local vs remote evaluation of a command. Attendees will be able to use tunnels for SSH or sample other protocols (MySQL and HTTP), and tunneling via a third party system. They will also be familiar with dynamic SOCKS proxies and using SSH to tunnel graphical applications. Finally, attendees will also learn SSH configuration and command line tips for convenience of use, including using forced command to restrict an SSH key to one purpose.

Topics:

* Local Tunnels
* Remote Tunnels
* Tunnels via 3rd-party Hosts
* Dynamic Tunnels
* FoxyProxy
* X11 Tunneling
* Service Tunnel Examples
* Configuration Tips
* Command Line Tips
* Tools That Use SSH
* SSH Home Game
