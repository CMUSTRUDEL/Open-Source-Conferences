Nobody complains that the database is too fast. Many seek to improve the performance of their queries by adding indexes and are shocked to find performance may worsen. Histograms do not have the overhead of indexes but it is not a one size fits all cure.

This session will cover indexes, histograms, there best uses, and how to determine which will help your situation.
