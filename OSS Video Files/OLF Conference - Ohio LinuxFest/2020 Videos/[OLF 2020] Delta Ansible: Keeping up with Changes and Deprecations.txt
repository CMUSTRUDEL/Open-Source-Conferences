Ansible is a very well known tool that is now owned and maintained by Red Hat 
that simplifies configuration management. In recent years,
 its development has been fast-paced and has frequent iterations and new feature releases. 


Despite the benefits that this brings, it has made it hard for sysadmins and devops teams to keep up with the latest best practices, deprecations, and the newest features. Starting from the 2.0 release, I will walk through select features that have undergone significant changes and deprecations from a sysadmin’s perspective with the intent of providing easy-to-implement upgrade strategies. Additionally, I will outline what is required for a minimal integration testing environment, mentioning the pitfalls and gotchas that I’ve run into on the way, in order to provide a path for ongoing upkeep and maintenance. All this, of course, always pointing back to the release notes.
