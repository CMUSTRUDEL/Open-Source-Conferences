Title: [OLF 2020] 404 Not Found: How the internet works (or doesn’t)
Publication date: 2020-12-31
Playlist: 2020 Videos
Description: 
	Speaker: Patrick Shuff
We all use the internet every day – we send emails, binge watch our favorite shows, “Like” cat videos, and browse content from all over the world from our living rooms. But have you ever wondered how we got to this point? How did the internet begin? And what happens behind the scenes to make that movie magically show up on your screen when you press play?

In this talk, we’ll discover the origins of the internet, explore how it evolved over time, and learn how digital “goods” like our videos and emails are delivered directly to us in an instant. You will come away from this talk with some high-level knowledge of how the internet is built, why it sometimes breaks, and a better understanding (and hopefully appreciation!) of the world wide web that you interact with every day.

and um today i will be um sharing

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,320
hopefully a useful kind of a story or

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
analogy of how the internet works

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
um and how the internet sometimes

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
doesn't work and

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
um this is my i believe fourth time uh

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,359

you know happy that the team was able to

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,679

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,719
kind of dive in

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,520
and and we'll go through it so

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
whoops here we go um so i did have a

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,239
really cool

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
uh video to show here but it doesn't

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
look like my internet's working

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
uh this is a joke where if i was a live

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,640
audience everybody go crazy

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,760
and holler but um here we are so

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
so who am i and why you know do i you

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
know why am i up here

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
talking about the internet so i'm going

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
to give a kind of a brief introduction

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,200
on to myself i've been very fortunate to

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
um to one have um

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
grown up around computers for much of my

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
life i

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,159
my first computer was a commodore 64.

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,159
long long time ago

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
um so i've just always kind of had

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,119
computers around

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,159
and um with that um in my career um

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,960
both here in ohio and columbus and i

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
also

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
spent a few years at um two really big

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,759
tech companies who

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,040
combined or even just uh separately they

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,320
comprise a really sizable portion of the

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
internet traffic

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,119
uh and you know the bits delivered over

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,119
the internet editing it on any given day

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,240
so um kind of fast forward to 2006

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,799
um i joined ohio state

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,399
as a an undergraduate in the computer

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
science and engineering so

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
having grown up around computers for a

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
long time i really

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,200
uh you know i kind of knew i was going

00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
to go into computers in some capacity

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
and

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,000
cse just kind of made the most sense uh

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,159
in terms of kind of a mixture of theory

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,520
and actual practical application

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,440
and it was in 2006 and i'll i'll

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
wait till the end to share my first

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
experience with linux

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720
um because i remember it well from about

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
2006 is when i really

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
started using linux for the first time

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
and um

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,599
it was actually uh i i kind of

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
kind of fell into it um because it was

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,120
really really frustrating for me

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
and i was completely on windows at the

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
time but um

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,599
it was so frustrating that i just

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,200
decided to wipe every system i had from

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,760
windows and go to linux and

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
you know fast forward 15 plus almost 15

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
years later

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
actually ended up being a really amazing

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
career move for me um

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,040
also while in school i learned about

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,120
python so that's

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
you know i never really started coding

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,200
in a real way until college and it

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,760
really wasn't until i learned python

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,360
that

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
the world really opened up for me and

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
things that i wanted to build and

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
problems i needed solved

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
the python language helped me do that um

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
so

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
i really you know i think like the late

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
2000s were really where um

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,879
i i i i kind of i guess

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,959
progressed in in my career in a big way

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
and i want to add too i was a very very

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
average um

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
student like i did the things i needed

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
to get done but i was much more

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,280
interested in building things

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
outside of the classroom and that's

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
really where kind of the roots of my

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,239
linux and

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,319
software engineering background kind of

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
stemmed from so

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,239
following college um again i was using

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
linux and i was using it full time

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,440
all throughout school and in 2011 i

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
joined my

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,840
first full-time company or my first

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,599
full-time job was with nationwide

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
insurance on the linux team so we were

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,640
essentially doing

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
a lot of system administration work and

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,920
at the same time i was able to

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
automate a lot of the annoying

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,720
repetitive things um

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,959
that you know is involved in sysadmin so

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
doing a lot of linux um and you know

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
kind of

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,439
we had a few thousand servers that we

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
managed at the time and it was you know

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
really great for me to kind of apply all

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
the things that i've done previously in

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,319
school you know at home

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
to you know real world situations i'm

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,280
only going to make one political

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
statement um throughout this whole

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,519
presentation and

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,319
it's with uh this slide here um i

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,760
am i really prefer emacs so i'm i i i'm

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
emax over vim

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,680
i actually you as a sys admit if you're

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
really a good sis admin you have to use

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
vim all the time so

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,479
still use vim all the time but um emacs

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
is is

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,040
the editor that i prefer um i will say

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
these days i do use vs code but still

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,880
have the emacs key bindings

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,080
cool so um an hyd was i was really

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,759
pretty happy there i was working there

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
about a year and a half and i got hit up

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,560
by a recruiter on linkedin

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,479
from facebook who asked me if i wanted

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
to um interview with them so at the time

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,880
i didn't think i had a chance getting a

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
gig with them

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,919
but fast forward two phone interviews

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
one flight

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,919
out to menlo park and five grueling

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
on-site interviews later i ended up

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,120
getting a job full-time uh with facebook

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
so

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
um my uh my fiance and now wife at the

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
time

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
uh or my now wife uh made the trek from

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,960
ohio to california

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,320
so i joined a team called the global

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
site reliability team

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
and um again like i really my background

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
i consider myself a python and linux

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,880
person like i'm kind of cis admin you

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
don't have the python knowledge but

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,039
um in this role we managed um i traded

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
in a few thousand linux servers at

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
nationwide to

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,960
a few hundred thousand linux servers at

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,479
facebook so you know we were managing

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
the global site we didn't really own

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
anything

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
in except the general reliability of

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,280
facebook so

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,639
um i not only got exposed to really big

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,639
distributed systems

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,080
which was a really great experience but

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,440
um i also what

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,360
more importantly and where i've learned

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,400
way more in my career and any role that

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
i've ever had is

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
i get to see how things break we were

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,160
literally the 24 7 break fix

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
team who had coverage here in the united

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,759
states and also in dublin ireland who

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,039
were involved in every single outage so

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,880
seeing distributed systems how they're

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
built and seeing how they break

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
really um you know it puts an impression

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,759
on you and makes you

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
gives you a really good insight into how

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,479
to build things and how not to build

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,440
things

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,280
so one of the um i think one of the main

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
goals of any engineer in any role that

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
you're in

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
is your job is to automate yourself out

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
of your job like

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
you should you know replace yourself

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
with ideally code

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,400
and then you can go move on to bigger

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
better problems and a year and a half

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
into facebook

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,360
that's actually exactly what my team did

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
we had about 20 engineers in the team

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
where we were doing like literally and

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
this is crazy to think about even in

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,319
2012 but

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,759
we were doing database migrations and

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
for you know for facebook

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
and we ended up automating all those

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
things away and building systems to

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
to do that job so that team actually

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
dissolved and we got to go figure out

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,560
where we wanted to

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
to go and one of the areas that i

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
thought was really interesting that i

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,720
had very little

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,479
knowledge of at the time was networking

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,919
and specifically like how does the

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
internet work how do people get to

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,840
facebook and one of the really cool

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,479
things

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,680
that they had um is it still exists to

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
some extent today is

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,039
uh you could actually send people from

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
facebook

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,319
and from one continent and move them to

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,319
an entire another continent by

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
editing one line in a single file and

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,160
that was kind of fascinating to me i

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,280
needed

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
i wanted to know how it works so i ended

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
up joining the traffic and cdn team

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,080
so their job is to make sure no matter

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
where you are in the world whether you

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
use facebook

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,880
instagram whatsapp etc um when you use

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
those apps

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
we know we detect where you are in the

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
world and that is not based on gps

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,199
location

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,880
those don't matter at all we based that

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,840
based on the internet and where you're

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
at located

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
within the internet so um i ended up

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
joining that team for

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
a couple years and we ended up helping

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,440
build out the global

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
internet infrastructure and photo and

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,680
video delivery uh

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,360
systems on that team so if in the last

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
eight or nine years you've ever seen any

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,400
of these memes on facebook and they got

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
delivered to your phone or your website

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
or

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,479
your browser really fast um you're

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
welcome um i i

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
some of the teams that i that i worked

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
on um you know both those systems to

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,039
make sure that delivery was really

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
quickly

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,440
so um the last team i worked on at

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
facebook was um the disaster recovery

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,960
team uh so

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
when you work on a site that big and you

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,560
have a global presence

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,440
as they do um one of the things that you

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
need to think about

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,039
is and you and you have a multi-data

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,440
center kind of region

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,560
or you know multi-data center system

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
sorry website

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
um you need to think about disaster

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,680
recovery and one of the things that has

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
happened many times is you know big

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
hurricanes have come through and

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
you can wipe out an entire region you

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
know an entire east coast so

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
i was on a team that we would go and

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,879
simulate those types of events

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
and make sure that facebook stayed up

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
cool

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,320
so going to 2018 um i had my wife and i

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,120
had a child in california which set in

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
motion

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,399
are want to move back to ohio so

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,919
um at the time i was trying to move back

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,720
to uh with facebook

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,320
um to to work remote which um it didn't

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
end up working out that way which is

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
which is kind of ironic because now

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
they're um they want to lead the uh

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,920
the remote workplace um i guess in the

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,519
industry which is actually really cool

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,959
um but

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,480
since i wasn't able to do that with

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,000
facebook i ended up by deciding to join

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
netflix so i joined their site

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
reliability engineering team

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
too and which allowed me to move back to

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,560
ohio and work

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
for them and and work on their video

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
delivery team so many of the things i

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,360
was doing at facebook

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
um working um and doing that with

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,839
netflix so

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,000
cool so after moving back to ohio uh

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
last year in 2019 uh again i was really

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,320
happy at netflix i love the product

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
i love the company um but i things have

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
changed a lot in the time that i was

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
gone

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,560
from ohio to california and one of the

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,240
things i wanted to do was just

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,920
see what you know get the pulse of the

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
the community things had changed a lot

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,040
in terms of startups

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
in terms of you know conferences like

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
this they've grown crazy

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
in a crazy amount and i just wanted to

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
see what people were working on and so

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
i met with a bunch of different folks

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
coffee and lunch and i ended up meeting

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
the co-founder and ceo matthew benson at

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
e-fuse um he explained to me

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
um you know kind of the mission of what

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,519
they're trying to do um and i ended up

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
making the move from netflix to join

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
efus last year

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,000
as the chief technology officer so just

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,720
to give you a really brief introduction

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,880
to what they do

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
um there's over 160 universities that

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,920
either have

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,600
varsity sports programs or building

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
collegiate esports teams so

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
just like ohio state has varsity

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,440
football they also have

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,320
a varsity league of legends team where

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
students are getting full ride

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,360
scholarships to play

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
games on a full ride so um what youtube

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
is trying to do

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
is help build that professional gaming

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,519
resume to help find aspiring

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
either professional players collegiate

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
players or even you know

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
people who are are looking to you know

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
you know join a professional team you

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
know help them

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,120
you know build out their resume and on

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
the other side of it we're working with

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
um college coaches universities

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,079
recruiters to

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
help bring those opportunities to the

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
industry

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
um to the the people on our platform and

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,480
we also have very much

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,600
a community networking aspect of it as

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,959
well so

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
um oh that's based on linux docker ecs

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
amazon

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
um so but i'll just go for the talk

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
today

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,920
so um this is going to be a slightly a

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
much higher level talk last year i gave

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
a talk

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,720
advanced site reliability engineering

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,760
networking um it went very deep on the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
networking side

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
and um this talk is going to be much

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
more high level and

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
we're going to talk about kind of the

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
origins of the internet and

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,000
applying it to something that i assume

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
everybody's pretty

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
comfortable or familiar with this

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
ordering packages on amazon and how

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,519
those packages get delivered to your

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
home

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,519
so um this is um you know where we'll be

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
spending um

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,680
the the next bit of our time again it is

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,959
a lot higher level if you're looking for

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
really deep tcpip you know dns related

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,480
things i definitely recommend going and

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
looking at that talk last year or

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
i've done a global uh global load

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,320
balancing talk as well um

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,839
while on facebook so let's um assume

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,880
that we're at ohio state

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,760
in the 70s or so so you know we're

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
we're here we're um we're working on

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
research

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,600
and you know we're starting to build

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
this local network

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
around the campus so you know

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
researchers and and professors want to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
share

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
information you know between each other

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
so we build this local land

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
local area network and everything's

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,639
great you know ohio state you know

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
they're they're building this

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
you know they're sharing research

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
together collaborating and you know

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
overall life is pretty good

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,680
and at the same time indiana is doing

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
the same thing where

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
you know graduate students professors

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,240
you know they're all researching

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,120
collaborating and you know the the the

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
quality and the

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
the speed at which they can do this

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
research has really increased in a big

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,279
way

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,120
so everything's great but then all of a

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,519
sudden you know

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
both indiana and ohio state want to you

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
know

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,440
share information together so they both

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,279
have this local area network this land

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
and but they want to figure out like how

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
do we share this information without you

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,720
know

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
actually physically driving you know

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
between the universities to

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,720
to be able to do this so this is where

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,440
um what we're going to do is we're going

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
to create

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
this internet or the inter network

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,440
so what we're going to do here is we're

00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,920
just going to actually physically run a

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
cable

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,040
between these two universities we're

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
going to put two routers

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
on each side of them and then they're

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,040
going to be able to talk to each other

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,639
so this is awesome so now these two

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,000
really big institutions will be able to

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
collaborate much quicker

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
you know do research together and

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,519
everything is great

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
so we've got this cable now and it's

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,040
just between these two

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,560
but now there's more universities that

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,519
want to join this network

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,880
so you know and they're also you know

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,200
they're building their local network as

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
well

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
so illinois jumps on board and then they

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
physically you know connect to the other

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,480
networks

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
and then ohio university joins and then

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
they connect to this network

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,040
and then as you can kind of see and as

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,320
you kind of probably envisioned the

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,399
evolution of this

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,639
um is such that you know we have a big

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,560
network of academic universities

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,240
and when people are looking at this from

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,560
the outside in particular the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,920
service industry or you know the the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
for-profit industries

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,519
they're like wow this is really amazing

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,000
we want to also you know collaborate

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
with

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,040
these universities and we can probably

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,639
use this ourselves

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,639
we need to you know share information

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,000
you know across our company across our

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
different uh you know

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,160
cities around the world and then this is

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
where the internet service provider is

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,959
actually born

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,959
so um and then this is where um you know

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,480
let's just say acmeco and these

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,240
different companies

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
they instead of just connecting directly

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,079
to you know these different universities

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
there's this internet service provider

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,079
and we're just going to say spectrum it

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
wasn't

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
spectrum back then but um they're the

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,680
ones that actually you know

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,519
connect to this global internet network

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,120
um and then they sold that service to

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,399
university or sorry two on these

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,199
corporations outside

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
and you know as you can kind of imagine

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
it just kept growing

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,680
you know more isps came up

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,360
um obviously you know in the in the 90s

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,079
this became much more consumer based

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
with uh

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,800
with dial-up internet etc and this is

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
just kind of how the internet

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
grew and you know became what it is

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,040
today it is literally

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,399
a bunch of inter networks that are

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
interconnected together

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,920
with global routing tables to make sure

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,639
the magic works

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,600
um on all the packets around uh you know

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,279
getting from

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,040
destination source to destination so

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,440
let's talk a little bit about the

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,560
architecture of the internet

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
and first i'm going to talk about or

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,800
show you

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,079
a visualization of the interstate system

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,759
so this is um back in the 70s um dwight

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,680
eisenhower

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:39,279
base put a um a mandate or

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,600
a directive out that we need to you know

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,440
create this interstate system so that we

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,839
can not only um not only for

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
you know defense and military purposes

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
um which

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
other big countries have you know set

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,839
precedent for in the past

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
but also to increase commerce and you

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,920
know and allow

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,279
people and goods to move more freely and

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
more quickly throughout the united

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,079
states so

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,000
um this is um approximately what the

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,320
interstate system looks like today

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,759
um i'm sure we're all very familiar with

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,279
the ones around

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,839
uh you know around columbus so um

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,920
interestingly um let's look at the us

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,040
internet system

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,199
so if we go look at a map of

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,199
the cables that are physically laid in

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,320
the ground these fiber optic cables

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,000
this is a very high level view of what

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
this actually looks like so

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,440
if we look at this compared to the

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,120
interstate system um

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
interestingly it actually the map

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,800
doesn't look that much different

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
you know the way cables are laid you

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,199
know throughout the united

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,959
states is very similar to that of which

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
you know the interstate system is laid

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,360
out and

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,040
again there's a lot more cables than

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,519
this throughout the internet but this is

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,920
just

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,199
again a very high level of kind of what

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,480
this looks like so

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
whenever you're you know hitting a

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
website and you're uh

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,880
you know hitting that aws region or that

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,199
google cloud region or that azure region

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,079
you are traversing these cables you know

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,759
to get to

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,199
your destination wherever it is so

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
what is it that i actually did sorry

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,799
you guys might be able to see that sorry

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,360
about that um what is it that i actually

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,319
did at facebook and netflix so what i

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,520
said was i

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,319
uh sorry

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,120
speaker is a bit center camera sorry

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,240
guys

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,679
um hopefully it's a little better um so

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,880
what was it that i actually did at

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
facebook and netflix

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,320
um again i mentioned that our job was to

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,840
make sure no matter where you are in the

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
world wherever you are connected to the

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,240
internet

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,240
photos and videos get delivered to you

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
as quickly as possible so

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,840
to kind of you know summarize this into

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
a service that i believe everybody's

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,880
probably familiar with is we effectively

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,120
built ways for the internet

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
so again taking a look at the us

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
interstate system you know this is just

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,240
a global view of

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,280
you know where the interstates actually

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,440
you know live

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
or you know are are cut through the

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
united states

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,559
and if we actually look at a map of ways

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
what waze does

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,559
is it shows you the traffic um and the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
congestion

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,640
and you know potentially any outages

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
that are happening you know throughout

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,200
the entire map of the you know

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
interstate

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,640
system as well as more locally as well

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
so looking at the columbus columbus

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,520
interstate system you know you have ways

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,679
here and you can see

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,600
and you know some places we have um you

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,760
know some congestion

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,440
you know up here uh you know there's

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
some congestion down here

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,559
this is you know what wage provides us

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,960
is this real time

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,720
kind of traffic information and again

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,240
this is what we were doing at facebook

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
is we were building

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,360
literally the map of the entire internet

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
and

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,679
you know just like waze is building maps

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,400
of our entire road systems

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,720
and what waze does is they map this out

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
for

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,480
you know cars traversing or you know

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
traveling between you know 20 and 70

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
miles per hour

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240
um at facebook what we were doing was

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
building these same maps of the internet

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
when packets are traveling approximately

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,200
the speed of light which

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
when you really think about it and you

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,039
kind of you know map around the world

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
it takes about um i think 200

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,280
milliseconds for one packet at the speed

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,120
of light

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,200
theoretically to travel around the world

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,480
so it's actually kind of slow um if you

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
really think about it and if you have to

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,760
travel your packets have to travel long

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,559
distances

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
so what waze does for us in the

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,120
interstate system or our roadway system

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,880
is you know it maps us to the closest

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
you know destination to where we want to

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
go

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,000
so say you know on 315 you know there is

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,080
an accident

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
waze's job is to tell me what is the

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,000
next fastest way now that this path is

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,840
no longer valid

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
what's you know what's the next best way

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,720
to go so what it's going to do is it's

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,200
going to take me 270 to 270

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,720
and then you know round two to my home

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
so let's say that there's another

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
you know traffic accident or there's a

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,320
lot of congestion on that route

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
waze will take me you know a much longer

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,840
route you know by distance

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
but it should take me there faster and

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,400
it it knows

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,080
hopefully that there won't be a ton of

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
congestion and hopefully it won't add to

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,280
the congestion as well

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,799
so let's apply that same thing to the us

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,520
center in that system and we'll talk

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,960
about you know

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
this is like these are the systems that

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
we were building i mean we were making

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,760
decisions you know we're building these

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840
new maps every single minute of the

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,960
entire internet

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,799
so at any given point in time there are

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
these different paths on the internet

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
that are broken um

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
the internet actually amazingly breaks

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,360
all the time

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
um and there's lots of different ways in

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,760
which the internet

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
fibers can be cut just you know common

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,400
maintenance

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,400
you know a backhoe where they didn't

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
properly you know get them marked off or

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,720
they

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,919
they cut too close to a wire and that

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
fiber got cut

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,360
um you know this happens again pretty

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,840
regularly and more regularly

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,640
than us as most internet consumers would

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,039
actually you know

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,960
think i've even see seeing a major

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,400
website go down because someone in the

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,440
middle of nowhere

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,280
in north carolina cut a tree took down

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
the wrong cable that was a major artery

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,520
for internet for that particular

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
company and they basically took down uh

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,559
the site

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
for some period of time and so it's

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,400
really amazing

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
um that such like subtle things can have

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,120
such huge impacts and

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
the fact that you know some of those

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,600
aerial lines can actually you know be

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,440
a major major part of you know some

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,679
portion of the internet

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
um and i kind of mentioned this you know

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,760
earlier as well is

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,640
natural disasters are another big enemy

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,960
to

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
the internet so you know obviously this

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
is a an image of a hurricane

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
and if you guys are you know using you

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,679
know aws

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,440
you know that one of the major regions

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
is u.s east one in ashbur

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,200
in in virginia and you know it's very

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
possible that one day

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
that a hurricane will come through and

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,799
take out that entire region like i know

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,799
amazon's doing a lot of work to

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,000
prevent that from happening but it's

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,600
very possible and i'm

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,039
confident one day that's actually going

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
to happen so

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,400
um in addition to hurricanes other

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
really big natural disasters that are

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
pretty

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,080
um can can wreak havoc on the internet

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
is tornadoes you know taking out

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
you know some you know major aerial

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
lines or even you know some in the

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,919
ground

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
um as well as earthquakes you know

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,679
california has a lot of

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,799
infrastructure as well you know us west

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,840
one um

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,520
is based uh you know in california um

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,960
and you know a big enough earthquake

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,760
could take that completely out

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,760
and also a lot of a lot of um aerial a

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,039
lot of fiber comes into la and even

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
seattle so

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,360
um you know a lot of natural events can

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
and will eventually cause a lot of

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,760
issues on the internet

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,080
this is the same view um looking at the

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,240
global internet system and again this is

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
pretty approximate but it's really

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,200
amazing that

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,960
you know you can see like these really

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
big places here like boston

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,240
it's a major ingress point for

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
networking la

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,919
miami is huge miami's you know they've

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
had a lot of hurricanes lately

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,360
and you know this can be a really this

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,960
could you know

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
cause a lot of issues especially for

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,600
south america that's where a lot of

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
these

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,520
a lot of the internet comes in you know

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,840
back to the united states so

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,400
it's really fascinating to see you know

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,080
how um you know the world is connected

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,960
and how the internet is connected so

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,039
now that we kind of have an

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,280
understanding of high level the

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,280
architecture of the internet um let's

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,440
take a look at how that compares to

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,360
physical good delivery versus digital

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,840
goods so

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,480
let's assume that um we're amazon um and

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,559
this is

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
you know amazon was started in the 90s

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,120
uh i believe that the story is jeff

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,960
bezos

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,480
was um kind of ticked off that he

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
couldn't find a particular book that he

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
wanted in any of his local bookstores so

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,159
he decided to build an internet company

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,760
um to to to

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,799
be able to deliver books to anybody in

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,440
the united states no matter where

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
they're at

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,440
so let's assume that when they started

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,919
and this is probably pretty close to the

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,400
truth

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,440
is they only had a warehouse in seattle

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
so

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,640
you know let's say that you know they

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,039
they're selling books to play

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
people all around the united states and

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,559
as you can see you know

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
they are probably you know mostly using

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,120
trucks to you know

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,960
to use the internet state system um if

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,720
you're in further regions of the world

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
you know they have to use different hubs

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
and

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,159
it's going to take longer for that

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,520
package to get to boston versus if that

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,080
package was you know

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,200
going to someone in california so um you

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
can just see that it's going to take

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
longer especially if there are delays

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,320
you know it could take you know quite a

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,240
bit of time so

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,159
let's go ahead and look at what netflix

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,120
might look like if they um you know they

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
were just started

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
and reid hastings says hey i want to

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,919
deliver this video

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
um they probably just started in

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,799
california and you know close to where

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
headquarters is and

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,840
they wanted to deliver this video you

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,520
know throughout the world

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,200
uh sorry throughout the united states to

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,799
different people to you know to

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,320
different consumers so

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,000
um again just as the interstate system

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,559
you can have outages at any point in

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,919
time

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,240
and the further you are the longer it's

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,360
going to take to get there similarly

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,360
video delivery is the same way you know

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,159
those packets still have to traverse

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
you know you know thousands of miles of

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
of land

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
to actually get there as well as you

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
know

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
there's going to be outages at any point

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,919
in time those packets need to be routed

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,559
around

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,159
and the longer that packet is on a fiber

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,360
the more chance that it will be dropped

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,480
at some point or there will be

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,159
congestion

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,440
or the more routers that it traverses

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,960
you know you always want the mo the

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,840
minimum amount of time

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
um for that packet to be on the internet

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,520
so

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,640
you know kind of fast forward in and you

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,480
know amazon

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
became the behemoth it is you know they

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
started selling a lot more things than

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,559
just

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
books um but you know what they wanted

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,640
to do is they really wanted to

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,279
tighten the time that you know shipping

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,279
uh you know

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
took right they amazon wanted to make it

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,440
so that you didn't go to you know

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,120
walmart or miner or any or best buy

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
you know to get that whatever that

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,480
gadget or that thing that you wanted

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
they wanted to get it to you as quickly

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,000
as possible and

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
similarly netflix had a similar kind of

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,080
problem where you know they wanted to

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
make sure

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
videos were fast they wanted to make

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,640
sure they they delivered at really high

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
quality

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,159
no matter where you are in the united

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,080
states so these are actually two

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,520
very different problems um you know if

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,559
you think about one's very digital ones

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,559
very physical

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,679
but they both have the same limitations

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,840
distance and

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,279
this is how the internet kind of you

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,880
know evolved into um to to

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,480
to be able to solve these types of

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
problems so

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
again let's look at that single amazon

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,880
seattle warehouse

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,279
and then you know when we look at this

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,559
map this is the u.s population density

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
map from 2010.

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,760
so um as you can see you know the

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,520
majority of the amazon customers

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
are likely not going to be in seattle

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
they're going to be in various parts of

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
the country

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,279
so you know what they needed to do is

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
figure out how do we actually deliver

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,640
these packages really really quickly to

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,880
folks that are on the east coast

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
so the way they actually solved this was

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
with an interstate

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,039
distribution network so

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,279
what they did was they strategically

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,720
placed these different warehouse hubs

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,720
all throughout the united states

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,080
overlaying that on top of that

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,559
distribution map

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,679
to make sure that no matter where you

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,000
were you know within

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
some percentile you know saying like 90

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
some percent 95 98

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
of the you know of the nation that they

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,760
could get it to you within about two

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
days you know that's when that two-day

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,159
delivery

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
um you know things started happening is

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,919
they wanted like where do we need to be

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,080
to make this really fast such that you

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,120
know we can deliver these packages and

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,279
you also need to think about the

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
logistics network making sure each of

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,520
those things that are people are likely

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,440
to buy

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,559
are you know located in those different

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,080
warehouses so

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,559
it's fascinating not only from a

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,559
physical um you know

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
presence scale but also the logistical

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,000
work that went behind

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,840
how do they how do they make this as

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,760
effective as possible

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,039
so let's look at netflix you know

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,200
similarly you know

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,720
netflix is a california-based company

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,640
the population density map the people

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
who are using netflix is going to be

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,159
nationwide they're going to be all over

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,080
the united states so

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,279
um what they they needed to solve the

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
exact same problem

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,000
and what the way they did it was they

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,799
created um this platform called netflix

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,320
open connect

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,919
where they created these um these these

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
basically these really big servers that

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
sat in internet exchanges

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,960
all around the united states so as you

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
can see um this is

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,480
a map of where you know many of these

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
you know could be

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
um you know there's internet exchanges

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,000
all around the us and this allowed them

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,159
much more quickly to deliver those

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
videos and also it really removes single

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
points of failure too right

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,200
you know if for whatever reason you know

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,840
california was somewhat cut off

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,640
or there's major congestion you know all

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,039
these

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,960
bits were located much closer to users

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,679
and just a secret that all of these

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,039
companies do

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,880
whether it's youtube whether it's

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
facebook whether it's netflix whether

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
it's amazon

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,240
they want to get your packet off the

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,720
internet as quickly as possible

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,399
the more time your packet traverses in

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,159
internet service provider

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,600
the long the more likely it's going to

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
fail um so

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
they want content to be as absolutely

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,760
close to their consumers

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
as possible to make them to allow them

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,200
to have the best possible experience

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,279
and when you think about photo and video

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,360
delivery these are you know these files

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,840
are getting bigger and bigger 4k okay

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,279
you know those bigger files you know

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,279
they're not going to be able to traverse

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,799
you know as long as they're much more

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,760
likely to you know to drop

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,919
so um if we actually really look at it i

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,600
kind of simplified it there where

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
um i just showed you a couple different

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,640
places where netflix has caches but

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
if we really look at the united states

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,880
this is

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,360
actually what it looks like and there

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,240
i'll just be quite open there's way more

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,799
than this this is

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,799
again just uh just an example but what

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,120
they do is they actually will

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,240
um they will actually work with internet

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
service providers

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,919
all around the united states and they

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
will embed caches directly into their

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,919
networks

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
and this is not something that just

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,120
netflix does this is something that all

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
of these companies do

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,600
youtube facebook amazon and even the big

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,200
cdn providers that you use you know

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,360
akamai cloudflare

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,480
fastly they're doing these things as

00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,679
well and they've been doing it for a

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,320
really really long time

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,120
so um similarly to what netflix you know

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,159
has done here

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,919
um amazon also if you look at

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,159
their distribution network they're

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,279
actually distributed in this way

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,399
and when we zoom into columbus we can

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
see

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,440
columbus actually has a few different

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,760
servers

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,039
of that actually contain almost the

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,440
entire netflix catalog

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,080
the u.s catalog right here in columbus

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,279
so

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,360
um i don't know what your internet

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,679
connectivity provider is today

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,440
but um what i would be what's cool to do

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,080
is go to netflix.com you know watch that

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,720
video pop

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,240
up and then you might see a little

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,760
airport code there and this is comment

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,039
across you know this isn't just netflix

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
this is facebook youtube too

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,240
you're going to see an airport code

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,200
maybe cmh maybe ord

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,840
maybe iad you know those airport codes

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,159
tell you

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,600
where in the world or where airport code

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,760
wise your

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,360
content is actually being delivered so

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,799
there's a high probability no matter who

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,519
you're with spectrum wow

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
um that you will not have to even leave

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,679
the vicinity

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,159
of 270 to get that video and

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,720
um i know this uh from my time at

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,880
facebook

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
ohio state even actually has a facebook

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,159
cache within their network i was really

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
really excited i actually worked on that

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,039
team

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,480
uh super pumped um when that happened so

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,640
hopefully internet's really really

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,399
fast facebook internet and instagram at

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,760
uh at ohio state

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,440
so you know again you know what we did

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
at these companies was we built

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,279
you know these maps of the internet and

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,000
again this is maps based on the internet

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,480
of where

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,559
these different caches or in this case

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
the movie catalogs were in the world

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,200
based on your actual

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,039
network uh location on the internet so

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,399
at any point in time these caches could

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,919
go down maybe they go down for

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,360
maintenance maybe they go down because

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
of a power outage or as

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,039
somebody in slack says a lightning

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,440
strike um

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,799
you know we need to make sure that we

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
are

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,760
doing that in a very same way and this

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
could even happen in the middle of

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
watching a movie so

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,000
you need to be really smart both on the

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,200
client and the server side to

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,600
dynamically track

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,440
to move that move that traffic um such

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,000
that that user or that consumer that

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
customer

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,519
never sees that buffering like that's

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,360
the evil of all platforms

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,279
video and photo delivery side nobody

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,799
wants to see that you know that spinning

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,640
spinning circle so similarly if we zoom

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,919
in and look at warehouses in columbus

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,679
these are they're actually five

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,679
warehouses at least in columbus when i

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,679
last looked on looked on google maps so

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,039
this is how your google and this on

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,480
amazon is able to

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,480
um do same-day delivery this is how

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,679
um you know you're able to get the you

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,200
know

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,720
amazon fresh you know to get those

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,720
groceries delivered is because they've

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,440
strategically placed these hubs

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,200
in major metropolitan areas so they can

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
deliver things really really quickly i

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,039
don't have a slide for it today

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,559
but you can even you know if you've ever

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,559
in amazon usc 2

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,559
columbus is also a big hub for data

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,600
center so facebook google

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,960
amazon maybe even apple they all

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,919
use columbus for uh you know major

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,880
internet um data centers because for a

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,960
few reasons one

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,159
um relatively inexpensive very good

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,960
internet connectivity

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,200
and um taxes aren't too terrible so you

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,640
know

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,480
columbus is actually a really cool hub

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,519
for tech when it comes to a lot of this

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,640
stuff

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,120
so um kind of in closing you know

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,240
i guess the goal of this talk is to you

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,519
know kind of help you

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,360
next time you you hit buy on amazon

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
um just kind of maybe appreciate you

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,159
know how quickly

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,320
you know that package is going to get to

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,640
you and you know when you go and select

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,080
that

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
option you know whether you're in a

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,279
rural part of ohio or whether you're in

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
columbus ohio

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,039
and how those options are going to

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,840
change based on how quickly that that

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,279
is delivered to you um and you know it's

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,279
based on availability it's based on

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,120
where the warehouses are closest to us

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,320
um it's really fascinating the amount of

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,679
technology and

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,480
the physical distribution of the of the

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,960
uh

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,640
warehouse infrastructure um and then

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,200
also you know when you press play on

00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
your next

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,200
netflix video or you know you go to

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,120
youtube and watch that video

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,720
just kind of appreciate you know the the

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,200
work that was done behind that

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,159
that traffic engineering to make sure

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,159
when you hit play

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,000
it knows where that video actually lives

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,720
where that you know youtube video is

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,399
cached

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,919
and then you know optimally you know

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,440
sends you there so that it's really

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,560
really fast and a really really

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,000
great quality so um lastly

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,520
uh i'll just um you know want to say

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,639
i'm my um i've been really fortunate to

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,280
have worked at you know some of these

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,480
companies

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,359
and um you know i would back in 2012

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,000
when i

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,440
you know left nationwide um or when i

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,480
was even working at h1 when i was in

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,320
college

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,520
working at startups wasn't really even

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,000
an afterthought for me

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,839
so um you know it's it's been really

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,079
amazing to see in my almost seven years

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,480
at

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,280
california how much things have changed

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
and

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
especially in the startup scene and the

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,560
venture capital scene and

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
really just technology companies in

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,520
general um it was

00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
awesome to see and made me really

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,040
excited to come back and

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,320
you know i wouldn't trade my time out

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
there and especially at those companies

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,000
for anything career-wise but one thing

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,079
i'm more confident in

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,359
this in 2020 than i ever have been

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
before is

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,520
that no longer do you have to move to

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,480
the coast to the east coast and west

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,920
coast to

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,520
um you build a great career in

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,280
technology and

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,640
i think it's really easy for me to say

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,400
that today with kovid

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,880
but there's videos of me saying that

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,599
last year um after moving back as well

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,440
um so i really do believe this and you

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,920
know really that's one of my goals

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,680
is to uh in in in leaving these

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,320
companies is i love facebook i love

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,240
netflix

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
i they were really great companies but

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,640
i'm really excited to

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,320
one is to spend my time in energy you

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,760
know based here in columbus and in

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
building the community the tech

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,920
community here um

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,760
and also and secondly just building

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,359
amazing an amazing company you know

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,800
i i love a lot of things about those

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,960
companies i want to help

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,000
build you know those that next amazing

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,680
engineering company

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,920
that amazing tech company you know right

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,680
here in columbus ohio so

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,680
um yeah that's it thank you

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,839
thank you very much patrick that was a

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,839
quick ending

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,079
thank you so much wow the scale of that

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,720
is

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,680
almost to quote princess bride

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,680
inconceivable

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
thank you so much um we have a few

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,920
questions if there's time

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:34,880
yeah okay let's see here i'm trying to

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,520
i'm gonna do stuff on my end all righty

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,280
uh

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
so yeah it's it's really interesting

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,160
that you mentioned league of legends in

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,079
your talk i didn't think in an open

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,520
source conference we would mention like

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,040
league twice in 30 minutes and when you

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,720
were mentioning like that you were gonna

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,359
say a political statement i was just

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
like

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,240
and then you just talked about you know

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,800
your editor um

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,440
so one of the questions we have is what

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
causes

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,640
packets to drop over long distances

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,680
that's kind of like a

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,480
interesting origin question do you

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,839
do you know that one yeah i mean i

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,800
imagine there could probably be this

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,839
physics answer

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,920
um where you know over the longer

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,760
something travels over a wire or a fiber

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,320
optic network the more noise and the

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
more

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,839
i'm not you know obviously i don't i

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,880
don't know these things um yeah the more

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,599
likely it's going to

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
you know drop right um so or the more

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,160
likely there's going to be interference

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,079
i should say

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,760
um so that's just at the purely like at

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,880
the cable level right and when you have

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
cables literally

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,320
strewn across the ocean underneath the

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,359
ocean that's a really amazing youtube

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,680
video yeah

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,359
if one of those fibers get cut like a

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,040
ship comes and like cuts one of those

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,640
go look at a video watching how these

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,320
ships go and repair those cables it's

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,079
fascinating but that was actually one of

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,720
the questions too is like is he gonna

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,440
talk about

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,000
all those wires under the ocean and how

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,880
we actually

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,599
are connected it's it's crazy yeah you

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,119
have these

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,800
these these cables and they have like

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,359
these repeaters every

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,720
large distance but a lot of them um that

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,800
even make the internet work and

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,079
yeah and ships will drop an anchor cut

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
one of those things and it's very

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,720
expensive and it takes weeks to fix some

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
of those things but

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,240
it's fascinating and like that's

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
literally one of the things that my team

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,960
was building

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,720
um at facebook was to simulate cutting

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,520
one of those cables like removing

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,400
multiple terabits per second of capacity

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,119
over a cable

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,160
um so it's it's just fascinating just to

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,480
do like the stress

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,240
tests and yeah to see what happens make

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,359
sure make sure our networking gear works

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
properly but um

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,200
just to add a little bit more to the the

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
the question like how things drop is

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,920
not only do you have cables you know

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,320
connecting and you have the physics

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,880
there

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,240
you also have routers um you know you

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,520
have routing packet routing

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,280
you know between each of these different

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,280
places deciding where it needs to go

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
you have you have you know does it send

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,720
it out this this cable or this cable you

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,320
know multipathing and

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,400
in any of those cases routers get

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,599
congested um they have to decide which

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,599
packets to drop

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,599
and you know if you're you know it just

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,119
happens and it happens all the time

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,640
um you know it's a regular occurrence

00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,440
and that's why we have amazing protocols

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,520
like tcp

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,800
like transmission control protocol like

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,160
its whole job is to

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,760
you know make sure that it's not

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,920
overloading you know the path that it's

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,359
currently on to re-transmit packets

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,800
um that's definitely you should go check

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,760
out the last year's talk if you're

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,680
interested in that

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
but um a lot of really cool stuff that

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,160
makes the internet work it's fascinating

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,680
that all trickles down into us seeing

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,640
that netflix like

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,920
something went wrong try again or

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,280
whatever

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,040
which doesn't happen well you're not

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,359
personally responsible don't worry

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,640
not anymore did you have anything

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,839
advanced i have a list

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,480
so just let me know i just wanted to say

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,839
there was

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,000
a a question that came up oh yeah uh q

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,480
a uh someone was asking if there are any

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,480
suggestions on career directions for

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,520
for new people that are entering the

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,520
technology field

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,180
and i'll say someone was impressed in

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,560
the slack about

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,920
[Music]

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,240
you making it through the interview

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,240
process at facebook apparently it's uh

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,000
hey i'll say i i said it and i'll say it

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
today i don't know if i'd get through it

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,880
again you know

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,240
like sometimes you do well at interviews

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,160
sometimes you don't and

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,599
um that was a common thing that you know

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,800
like i don't even know i i did hundreds

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,240
of interviews there and like i don't

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,560
know if i'd go and be able to pass it

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
this time

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,839
it goes for any company you know and

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,720
depends on interviewers you have but

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,160
hopefully those

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,160
those processes are reasonably

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
calibrated so that you know that's why

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
you have five interviews it's not to

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,359
like crush your soul

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,040
they get enough signal about your

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,160
abilities you know because some people

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
are gonna miss things they're you're

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,119
gonna you might do terrible in the linux

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,040
one but kill the networking

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,400
and like that's why they're they're

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
structured the way they are

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
um and i again i've done a lot of them

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,520
and i think it's

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,920
there's uh well anyway it everything

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,240
works

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,079
really well um as far as career path

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,240
it's hard like i can't tell you

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,599
it's so hard for me to say just go build

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,400
things like just go do what's

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,560
interesting to you

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
i went i i'm really fortunate like i

00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
went and like

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,920
went to linux because i was so

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,200
frustrated not frustrated yeah because i

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,359
was frustrated with it like i was

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,560
completely lining windows at the time

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,599
the terminal was

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,040
so crazy to me and that's why i made

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,079
this crazy decision like i must like

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,079
paint where i was like i'm just going to

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,079
wipe all my windows systems go to linux

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,599
and do it and a year later you know i

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,440
was pretty solid i mean

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,119
again i was much more comfortable in

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,200
linux and this is when linux was a lot

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,960
harder you know back in 2006 as

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,599
it is today but um you know as far as

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,920
networking goes i i dropped out of cs

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,280
7671 or whatever it was at ohio state i

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,440
never even took a networking course

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
but i went and you went to join a

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
networking team and

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
that's what's really cool about like a

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
company like facebook is like i was a

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,720
linux

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,560
and software python person going and

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,640
working and going to a networking team

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,079
and like so what was really i was like

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,079
working at this intersection between

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,359
these different kind of disciplines um

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,720
like i don't even know what i'm good at

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,000
anymore like i can talk a little bit

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,599
about networking a little bit about

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,160
linux you know some python

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,640
but um you know so your official title

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,359
is like

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,960
yeah jack of all trades yeah i'm very

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,440
much a generalist and i love it too

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,720
because

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,240
i can go and like i just like learning

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,640
and trying new things um

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,680
this is a really interesting question

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,839
how would

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,280
netflix survive without distributed

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,040
networks

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,640
like i've i was trying to think about

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,359
that myself because it's just like i

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,359
feel like

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,760
a lot of these services came about

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,079
because of the distributed nature of it

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,079
you know

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,599
it couldn't and the thing about these

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,000
companies is

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,920
they there's no like you know when you

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,359
talk about cdn providers like akamai and

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,440
fastly and cloudfront

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,640
there's no cdn provider that can handle

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,640
any of these companies like

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,880
they're literally like building the

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,800
internet and building internet capacity

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,960
um the amount of traffic that's going

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,319
you know bet between these really local

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,920
regional networks

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,680
you know a crayon um in the in the

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,920
networking space like isp space

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,280
is just phenomenal and like it just

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,480
couldn't exist

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,480
but that's what's amazing about you know

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,920
their pivot from you know the dvd

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,359
the delivery to this oh yeah it's

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
kind of amazing it's like the internet

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,359
literally made this happen and then now

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,160
they're pushing the boundaries up there

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,760
yeah well you are definitely pushing the

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,000
boundaries of everything my goodness

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,160
like

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the scale of that was amazing thank you

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,920
so much for your time

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,160
i think it's we're moving right along

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,520
here you don't even have time to show

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,880
another linux book

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,000
i was going to grab some um yeah i went

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,079
ahead uh

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
throw things over to uh warner he's

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,599
