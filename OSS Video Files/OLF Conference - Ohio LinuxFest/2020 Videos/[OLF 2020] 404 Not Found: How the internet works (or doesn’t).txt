	Speaker: Patrick Shuff
We all use the internet every day – we send emails, binge watch our favorite shows, “Like” cat videos, and browse content from all over the world from our living rooms. But have you ever wondered how we got to this point? How did the internet begin? And what happens behind the scenes to make that movie magically show up on your screen when you press play?

In this talk, we’ll discover the origins of the internet, explore how it evolved over time, and learn how digital “goods” like our videos and emails are delivered directly to us in an instant. You will come away from this talk with some high-level knowledge of how the internet is built, why it sometimes breaks, and a better understanding (and hopefully appreciation!) of the world wide web that you interact with every day.
