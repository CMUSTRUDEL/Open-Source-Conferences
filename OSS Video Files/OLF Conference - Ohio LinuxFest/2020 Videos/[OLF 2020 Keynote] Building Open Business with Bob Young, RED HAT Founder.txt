of of doing that but bob if i remember

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,880
correctly

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,080
you would actually been a digital um

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,400
distributor right that's exactly right

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
in in my previous life i was in the

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,399
equipment rental and leasing business

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,160
wow um and uh and digital was our

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,800
biggest single supplier

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,399
of computer terminal equipment and and

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,879
mini computers

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,640
this is in the late 70s uh through the

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,440
1980s

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
uh the second of the companies i built

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,399
in that

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,559
field got into financial difficulty in

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:01,440
1992 i found myself unemployed uh

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,719
and that's that i'll tell the story if

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
you like but that's

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,600
how i ended up in the open source uh

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,720
free software world

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,360
uh stumbled across linux and and uh

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,479
but for my business going out of

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,799
business

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,799
uh i would not have had the success i

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
did have with red hat

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,640
well and and then you went and started

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,000
acc core

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,040
the little catalog of selling cds

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680
and stuff like that and you also hooked

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
up with

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,799
phil hughes of the linux journal and you

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,439
decided to put out the linux journal and

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,000
my understanding was you lasted exactly

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,200
one issue of of of the linux kernel

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,360
two issues uh

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
and in fact i think we did i think we

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,000
got more than that i think we were at

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,840
three or four

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,799
issues but but um it was

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
so the story was here's the sequence i'm

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,719
unemployed

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,320
working out of my wife's sewing closet

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,840
uh i still need a point no no this is a

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,720
long before needlepoint

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,800
uh this is this is uh 1993.

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,720
um and uh uh i had been

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
publishing a little newsletter called

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
new york unix

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,879
to all the unix user groups up and down

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,040
the east coast uh

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
because in the leasing business i was

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
competing with much bigger companies com

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,200
disco and lisa metric

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,200
so to try and find deals before my

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,319
bigger competitors did

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,599
i i ran this newsletter

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,080
and i was trying to find the the the

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
the technical people within citibank and

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
the other large

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,000
uh users of unix

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,879
find their needs before their needs went

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
to their

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,959
uh their uh purchasing department

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
and i would win the business and and get

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,400
a big promotion and do well

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,959
uh instead of which uh

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
so instead of which i found myself

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,680
unemployed

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
so i decide maybe my new york unix

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,239
newsletter is a good business

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,879
in and of itself when i was unemployed

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,640
in my

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,760
wife sewing closet so i was doing that

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,440
full time i someone says hey you should

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,599
do the linux journal

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
uh phil hughes was looking for someone

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,280
to help him with

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,599
it so he and i teamed up he was the

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
original editor i was the original

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,720
publisher

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,400
uh we did that together for i don't know

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,040
maybe three or four months but meanwhile

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,959
i was starving to death i had three kids

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
and a mortgage

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
and i had to figure out how to pay this

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,959
mortgage and i wasn't doing it in the

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
publishing business so i realized i

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
should switch my business

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,760
from publishing to product distribution

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
in other words instead of selling

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,560
advertising to

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,239
others i should use my own customer list

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
for the magazines

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,640
and sell them computer parts

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,599
and o'reilly books and of course copies

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,280
of linux from slackware to igrasil

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,639
to uh pacific high tech

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,320
uh and it was when i was in the the

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
product distribution business

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,360
after i had handed the linux journal

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
back to

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
phil hughes and he took over publishing

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,360
it

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,080
that i needed products for my new acc

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
bookstore

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,960
a couple of my customers tell me about

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
this red hat thing that this kid in

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
north carolina was doing i call up mark

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,240
ewing

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
i say hey mark you know i'm looking for

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,400
products some of my customers tell me

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,800
yours is a really good linux

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
how about i buy i don't know i was

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,759
selling a

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
thousand copies of linux a month at that

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,479
time

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
so you know i should be able to switch

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,639
sell 10 of them if yours is a better

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,479
linux i should switch sell

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,520
10 so you know send me 90 days worth

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,440
you know send me 300 copies

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
dead silence at the end of the phone

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,120
turns out mark was only thinking of

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,400
manufacturing 300 copies

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
so so he's going holy cow i've hit it

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
big

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,639
this guy wants 300 copies meanwhile

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
i knew how little i was paying mark for

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,479
these 300 copies

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
and i knew this kid was starving to

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,560
death

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
and so over the course of a couple of

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,320
months we realized we had a lot in

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
common we saw the world the same way so

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,199
we put our two little businesses

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,000
together

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:54,960
and that became red hat

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
so i will tell you how i first got

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,880
involved with linux

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
uh at that time there was a magazine

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
called dr dobbs

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,360
journal of computer calisthenics and

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,240
orthodontia

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
or running light without overbite and

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
bite was spelled b-y-t-e

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,800
yeah and i would read that every month

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,319
and all of a sudden

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,919
it was november of 1993

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
in the back of it there was this uh

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,319
advertisement

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,360
for complete unix system with all the

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,520
source code

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,960
for 99 and i'm looking at this i'm going

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,919
that's crazy talk

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,919
because the the license for unix is a

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,440
hundred sixty thousand dollars for the

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
source code and that's the only way it

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
was distributed

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
and i knew that berkeley was still going

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
through its its uh

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
suit with atn t it hadn't been solved

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
yet

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,240
so how could they possibly do this

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,720
and but hey what the heck i set away my

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,319
99 dollars and i get this cd

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,319
and a very thin little book and i try

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,680
and run it but i can't run it because

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
i'm at deck

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,120
and i don't have any pcs i have

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
vax workstations i have bips

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,960
workstations i have alpha workstations

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
so i can't run this thing all i can do

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
is look at the man pages

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,560
so i looked at the man pages looks

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
pretty good put in my filing cabinet

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,039
went away

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,759
many months later when i met lena's at

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
decas

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,080
in new orleans and i met you know people

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
from red hat and stuff like that

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,360
i pulled that back out and lo and behold

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,160
it was

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:40,000
a copy of yggdrasil because in 1993

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,280
uh the linux kernel was at 0.99999

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,919
and companies like red hat and igrasil

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,039
and slackware and soft landing systems

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,639
and a couple others

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
we're bringing out distributions

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
so tell the story though you did not

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
meet

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,680
linus at decas uh you invited linus

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,680
to dks correct

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,919
uh oh

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,840
oh dear this isn't good

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
i don't think it's your fault bob i'm

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
trying to find

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,039
somewhere that maybe i have better

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,400
internet uh

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,319
slightly better mad dog's uh camera

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,240
likes to freeze and your

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,080
i think yeah your internet might just be

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,719
a little jittery

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,519
but where did you have anything prepared

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
for uh

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
small no for your business open business

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,800
building open businesses

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,399
so no i i was going to talk though about

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
the story so yes

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
i can speak i can speak to that for a

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
few minutes and then when we go to

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,000
questions

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
if we don't have any will mad dog and i

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
can get back into some of these stories

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,920
do you prefer me to be on camera would

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
you like to have me be off camera how

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,040
did how would you work this

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,880
i didn't refer to you it's fine by me

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,680
i'll be happy to

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
uh talk for about 20 minutes about how

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,920
to

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,320
think about open source businesses or

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,000
open businesses generally as in

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
businesses where you do not

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
hoard your technology you share your

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,399
technology

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,519
or your your invention so i'd be happy

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,680
to speak to that

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
okay i will jump off i actually did a

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,600
talk about open communities which is

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
less on the business side so i am like

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,760
waiting with baited breath

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
so i we will all be listening to you

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,160
okay good enough

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,240
all right so you some questions to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,839
prompt you along on that

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,080
that would be great too i read

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,920
an article by sjvn

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,640
uh interviewing you and you even said

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,760
during the broadcast

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,200
i'm not that smart so i decided

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,320
i don't know i'll start a company

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
that that's quite a bit of

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,880
the the leap of faith so

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,560
i i myself had um

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
experienced uh layoffs and unemployment

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,600
as

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,760
many other folks in the tech industry

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,519
and it it is a conversion to

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,640
working for um a large companies

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
like mad dog was but working for

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,959
yourself

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,600
can you talk a little bit about the

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
the working for yourself and believing

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
in yourself

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,880
to to put it all out on the line

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,160
sure and and i'll explain again

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,360
coming back to this open concept

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
uh it actually reduces risk so let me

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
tell that story because

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
it's a good one uh and so going all the

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
way back

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,000
okay so now i come out of college as a

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,120
really bad student

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
the one thing i i knew for a fact you

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
know

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,079
through 16 years from elementary school

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
to uh to being a really bad college

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
student

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,959
the one thing i knew is i was the

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,360
dumbest guy in the room

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
because my teachers each and every year

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,600
told me that

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,519
through the quality of my grades uh

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
to the point where at one point at one

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,279
particular school they used to put the

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,399
grades up this is back before

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,640
self-esteem

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,399
worries and this sort of thing they used

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,519
to put the grades up on the classroom

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
door

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
and i of course with the last name like

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
young thought they put them up there

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
alphabetically

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
because that explained why my name was

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,959
always at the bottom of the list

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,640
okay so you graduate college knowing one

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,360
thing that you're the dumbest guy in the

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,079
room

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,720
but yet you grew up in a family of three

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:57,519
boys all your cousins were boys

00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,560
you're a pretty competitive human being

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,720
so how can you be successful

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,240
if you're ambitious and you're the

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,000
dumbest guy in the room

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
and the answer is well there's actually

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
multiple answers

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,720
but one of the answers is in my case

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,440
don't

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,160
apply for a job because if i got a job

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
you pick a corporation i would never get

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,320
a promotion

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,440
because i'm the dumbest guy in the room

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
so in my case starting a business was in

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
fact

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,399
the low risk thing to do because all i

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,760
had to do was look after my customers

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,040
if i could make my customers successful

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,880
uh they would they didn't care

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,440
you know about whether i was smart or

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,399
dumb they didn't care about all the

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,399
the politics incorporation so whether my

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
resume was good or bad

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
they only cared whether i actually

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,880
solved

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,880
their problem for them uh so that was

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,959
one trick the other trick if you're the

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,320
dumbest guy in the room

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,639
make friends with the smart guys

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,639
which of course is why i'm friends with

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,680
guys like mad dog hall

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,600
is because john is for all his lovable

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
santa claus demeanor

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,200
is in fact a very smart guy

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
um and has the respect of other smart

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
people and i needed to recruit smart

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
people

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,560
so yes starting a business is a very

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,880
high risk activity don't kid yourself

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,639
uh was i nervous about starting my own

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,920
business yes

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,760
uh but like anything else the more

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,120
you if you practice things you get

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,440
better at them

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,680
so if you start a business and you fail

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,199
start the next business

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,839
because when you start a business and

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,839
you fail you didn't learn

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,839
it a lot of people make the mistake of

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,279
thinking that they learned

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
that they're not good enough at running

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,000
a business but that's not what they

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
learned they learned a huge amount about

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
running a business

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
they learned a huge amount about what

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
not to do in running a business

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
and if they embrace what they have

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,279
learned the next time they learn a

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,920
business

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,320
start a business that they're

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,240
substantially better positioned

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,160
and if the second business crashes and

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
burns start a third business because now

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
you're

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,320
three times as smart as you were the

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,000
first time okay

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,639
uh but here's why open is important

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
uh and it's one that you know i often

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
speak

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,160
people because of the success of red hat

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,160
they think i'm a smart guy and i'm not

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
uh so they asked me for the secrets of

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
success and

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
and my key secret there's two secrets

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,920
basically

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
one is uh and the most important one in

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
fact

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
is uh keep your friends close and your

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
loved ones

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,360
closer so

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,920
if you're lucky enough to find the love

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,040
of your life which i was

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,160
they are your priority your business i

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,720
don't care how important

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
it is i don't care how well it goes it's

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,800
a distant second

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,639
to your personal relationships okay

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,920
that's one number two

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:14,320
choose your parents very wisely

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,959
and sounds like a joke and it is a joke

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
uh but it's not a hundred percent a joke

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,839
because

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,839
it when i say choose your parents

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,560
understand what your parents

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,320
taught you appreciate what you learned

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
from your parents in my case i was a

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,240
very fortunate

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,519
uh i chose my parents very wisely let me

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,959
put it that way

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,959
and my father was a businessman and had

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
done some entrepreneurial things in his

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,639
career

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
uh but he was also just a very

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
broad-minded

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
person he was one of these people who

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
just

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,560
who sort of loved the world he was uh

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,320
fascinated by immigration he was not an

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,399
immigrant himself

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
but he could see how all the immigrants

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,759
we are living in canada

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,600
were making our country better uh

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,079
and so he was just a big fan of

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,720
immigration not on principle but simply

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,440
because he knew so many of these people

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,279
who were so motivated that if you're an

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
immigrant you're a risk taker

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,680
if you're not a risk taker why would you

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,759
get on a ship or an airplane to go to

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,560
some strange country

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,639
and risk takers are very productive

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,240
people in our society

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,880
but the point that he really enjoyed

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,880
was the free market system was democracy

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,839
he he was just a huge fan

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,600
of of the way demo our free market

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,399
democracies maximize our freedom

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
at an individual level maximize our

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,600
happiness

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,920
he he along with me are great uh

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
fans of the american constitution in

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,959
particular the preamble

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
of the declaration of independences was

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,360
it they was

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,320
the the line about uh the pursuit

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
of happiness you know life liberty and

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,519
the pursuit of happiness of all the

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,720
important things

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,160
in life pursuing happiness

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,880
gets written into your governing charter

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,280
as a country it's what i admire most

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,319
about the us but

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,039
but now if you take that concept and you

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,439
sort of say

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,240
you are a businessman what's your

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,439
purpose what's your responsibility

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,640
and your responsibility is to make your

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,480
customers world

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,840
a better place admittedly perhaps in a

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,960
small way but nonetheless

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,440
if you make their lives a better place

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,760
better than your competitors do the

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,160
world will reward you for making the

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,400
world a better place

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280
and that's what our our free market

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
democracy

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
allows us as business to do as

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,160
businesses

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
is our customers are voting with their

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,840
checkbook

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,960
every day on which supplier is

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,919
making the world a better place fastest

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,840
and if you build a business that makes

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,640
some set of customers world a better

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,480
place better than the competitors do

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,240
you'll have a big opportunity so

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,080
i do a couple of businesses in the

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,200
computer leasing business

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,880
from whatever uh one day i graduate

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,080
college 76

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,840
through uh 82

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,000
and in 80 sorry 92 the story that we're

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,640
telling with mad dog just there

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,039
and in 92 i stumble into this open

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,559
source

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,960
thing and i've been on on the computer

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,080
on the hardware side of the computing

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,280
industry

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,360
in hardware back in the 70s and 80s

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,400
there was just a truism

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,559
that hardware evolves forward faster

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,720
than software does

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,160
and when i would ask people why that is

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
true i mean software

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,320
hell software guys write software in

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
their pajamas

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,320
you know sort of on their computer

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,320
screen hardware guys

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,679
have to design a computer and then they

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
have to build an effing

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,440
factory to manufacture them

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
so why does hardware move forward faster

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,200
than software

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,400
i all of us in the hardware business

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
couldn't understand it

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,440
it was just a mystery fast forward 1992

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,280
i stumble into open source software

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,120
when i first see it i'm the world's

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,840
biggest skeptic of of

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,200
free software because i'd ask us where

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,520
is this stuff from

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,360
they'd say well it's from engineers

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,400
according to their skill

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,280
to engineers according to their need i

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
don't know if you've

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
studied any karl marx but that should

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,520
sound

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,240
familiar and

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
i'm going no i'm a business guy i'm i'm

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,400
a cold-hearted capitalist

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,520
and and things do not scale they do not

00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,799
replicate if there isn't an economic

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,159
engine driving them altruism is great

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,080
i love altruism i i hope that people

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,320
think i'm an altruistic guy

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
but that's on my personal side on my

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,760
business side

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,159
i understand there has to be a business

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,880
model the money has to flow

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,000
to allow these products to get produced

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
to be supported

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,720
and to evolve forward so

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,960
i'm looking at this open source stuff no

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,760
one can explain to me

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,240
who's paying for it and they're all

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,919
saying

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
oh it's going to be big and i'm going no

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,720
it's not

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
you know microsoft is going to come out

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,400
with a

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,200
a decent operating system one of these

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
days or

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,280
you know sun solaris will get their act

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,080
together or maybe ibm will solve the

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,320
operating system space

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,840
but the uh what happened was

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,039
it between 91 92 and 93 instead of going

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
away

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,720
this free software linux stuff kept

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,000
getting better

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
and i couldn't figure out why so i got

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,280
my car and i

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,760
went and visited the user groups that i

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,960
was telling you about previously

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,039
uh and uh i would ask them you know

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,400
where's this from i went up to uh

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:22,080
uh to boston i sat down with uh uh

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,280
richard stallman i but the the uh

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,159
defining story was i went down to

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
washington

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,720
met mad dog's friend don becker

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,919
the guy behind the beowulf project

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,320
uh giving a a presentation at

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:43,120
the dc linux users group

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,000
uh i'm you know showing real interest in

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,280
it he said but

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,799
if you're really that interested you

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
should come out to godard space flight

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,880
laboratory

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,640
and uh and see what we're doing uh so we

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,360
hop in his car at the end of this thing

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,799
at ten o'clock at night

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,480
uh and he was this was mad dog

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
probably can give you a date better than

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,039
i can but it was probably

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,840
early 1994 and he had

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,960
just unplugged godard had just unplugged

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
a five million dollar

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,679
cray mini uh super computer

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,320
and plugged in dawn becker's uh

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,760
beowulf linux machine instead and got

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,520
better performance out of it

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,960
out of a hundred thousand dollars of

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,480
off-the-shelf intel

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,159
equipment and when i went up to dawn's

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,440
lab to see this thing

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,440
it was literally four uh

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
the computers boxes you know the old

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,320
tower boxes across

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:42,000
by four up wrapped

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,799
with duct tape with ethernet drivers

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,880
uh like ethernet cards in each of them

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,600
all connected together at the back

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:55,039
with a spaghetti the spaghetti of wires

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,000
so i stopped and i go don why are you

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,760
giving away

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,840
all the ethernet uh software that you're

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,760
writing to make this work why are you

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
giving it away for free like

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,280
who's letting you do this because i

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,360
presume you're earning

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,720
a real salary at gdard to do this

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,480
so if you're writing valuable software

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:22,000
and it's costing goddard money

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,400
why would they give it away for free don

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
looks at me and goes well that's a

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,159
really good question

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
i don't know you should next time your

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,080
door

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,520
you should ask my boss dr thomas

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,679
sterling

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
and i go okay well thanks don uh next

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,880
time i'm in washington

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,640
you know you'll have to introduce me uh

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,480
don goes oh no don't kid yourself

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,799
uh uh dr sterling works stupider hours

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,640
than i do he's probably still here

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,000
so i meet thomas sterling in the

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,240
cafeteria of the

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,760
the basement of get our space flight

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,120
laboratory

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,480
and i'm asking him this question

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,120
and he goes okay hold on bob let me get

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,120
this straight

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,360
yes you're taking dawn's ethernet

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,039
drivers you're building it into the red

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,600
hat linux thing that you and

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,279
your buddy mark are doing uh and you're

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,120
not paying me any money for it so you're

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,880
getting it for free from me right

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,640
i go yeah that's right and why are you

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,320
letting me do this

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,440
it says because but so all i get in

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,640
return

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,919
because let's agree that dawn's ethernet

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,919
drivers are worth

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,120
tens of thousands of dollars you know

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,679
maybe 25

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,320
dollars uh that you should be paying me

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,360
but

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,279
when you give it when i give them to you

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,799
for free all i get in return

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:46,000
you know just all you're giving me back

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,559
is a gigabyte worth of

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,960
a high performance operating system with

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,279
complete source code and a license

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,640
that allows me to do whatever i want

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,400
with it

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,440
i think mad dog had a number of 160 000

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,400
versus code for unix

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,720
uh so so that's when i understood

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,120
that was when i got really excited about

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,520
this free software open source

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,720
red hat thing and when i went home that

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,279
uh

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,120
the next day and caught up with nancy

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,440
who was pretty worried about our college

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
our kids college education at that point

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
he's going you know nancy i think we

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
might actually be able to pay our kids

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
college education

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,600
and the reason for it is what becker

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
went um

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,480
dr thomas sterling had explained was a

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
barter system

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,120
and i understand barter system that's an

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,480
economic model

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,799
so gdard gave something okay for free in

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,080
order to get something back of higher

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,320
value

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,000
it wasn't a formal varchar system but it

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,039
was a barter system

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,200
once i understood it was a larger system

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,320
you could see how this thing could get

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,760
really big

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,919
because this informal economy coming all

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,480
the way back to the point of

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,200
how to think about your business and

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
should you be proprietary and should you

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
hoard

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,919
your knowledge and your ip or should you

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,559
share

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,159
your knowledge or an ip well you do have

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,840
to have a business model don't get me

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,080
wrong

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,559
but when you share your ip your

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,960
customers become your fans

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
you don't you know your customers aren't

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,039
over there

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,799
they're inside the tent with you they're

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,559
you're part of their team they're part

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,039
of your team

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,640
and so talking about teams i've done

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,520
this everywhere i've gone

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,919
as well as i can but hamilton tiger cats

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,840
the

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:48,159
football team uh if we'd

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,000
uh we have the a stadium that fits 25

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,279
000 people but we have another half a

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,360
million canadians

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,799
who think of themselves as tiger cat

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,000
fans

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,960
and the more we can rope them into

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,440
that this is their team this isn't my

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,400
team

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,320
this isn't some shareholders team the

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,240
tiger cats belong to the community of

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,120
hamilton and the more we can message

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
about that

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,799
and the more we can get their feedback

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,679
into how we should

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,480
perform better and just treat them as

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,320
our friend

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,159
as our friends we get better advice

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,799
and better feedback than if we sort of

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,159
kept them at arm's length uh and it's

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,480
more fun on top of that

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,039
our our players enjoy playing for our

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,880
fans because our fans are more engaged

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
our fans are more supportive of our

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
players because they

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,919
the players engage with them uh

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
lulu.com and by the way i should point

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,240
out pat

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,080
because given given the vast amount of

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,200
money that olf is paying

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,200
me to chat to you guys tonight

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,320
uh my only recompense as a sales guy

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,000
is impressions so the longer i talk

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,080
the more lulu impressions you get

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
sorry that's my little joke it's also

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,840
the commercial interlude we'll get back

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,120
to the story

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,159
uh at lulu the idea wasn't

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,000
oh we're gonna build a printing service

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
the idea was there's a whole bunch of

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,399
authors who can't

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,559
get their books published and

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,640
you know john grisham and jk rowling's

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,919
make a gazillion dollars

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,600
but anyone who's written a book with a

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,640
narrow audience

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,440
less than ten thousand copies a year

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,279
will not get published and they don't

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,080
get published because the publisher

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,320
can't figure out how to make money on

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,600
anything less than ten thousand copies a

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,840
year

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,120
but meanwhile the thousand people who

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,919
might have read your book and might have

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,039
gained value from your book are not

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,720
going to be served

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,480
because your book will never get

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
published

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,799
and that was the problem we are trying

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,399
to solve so our problem wasn't we

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,600
weren't thinking about this from the

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,880
point of view of

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,480
how do we get rich we were thinking of

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,480
lulu from the early days

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,799
of how do we make our authors successful

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,240
and again it's it's this thing that you

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,559
know going all the way back to the story

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,760
is telling you about my father this

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,000
this joy of working in a free market

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,880
democratic system

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,320
where we as business guys are making the

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,760
world a better place

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,760
one customer at a time is just such a

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,840
pleasure and such a joy and it takes so

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,679
much of the stress away

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,000
from launching your business because

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,720
it's no longer about you

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
it's about your customers it's about the

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,080
world

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
and if you can if you can build a

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,159
product

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,840
or a service that is just a little bit

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,000
better than your competitors you will be

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,880
successful

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,279
if you get lucky and you stumble into a

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,159
product or a service that's a great deal

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,320
better than your competitors then you

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,240
might build a red hat

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,840
and the cute story about open source and

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,080
red hat was or still is

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,279
that none of our bigger competitors so

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,120
when we were early

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:22,320
so 94 95 we start making some money 96

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,039
97 we're you know so we're starting to

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,799
grow

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,600
and we're going who's going to jump to

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,960
our market and take it from us

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,520
and we go well clearly microsoft should

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,760
and all of our source code is free

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
microsoft literally could download red

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,840
hat

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
linux and sell it as microsoft linux

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,159
that was the terms of our license you

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
know they'd have to recompile it but

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,279
you know they can have all our things

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,240
for free

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,880
so comes back to a question uh bethlyn

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
that you

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:59,519
sort of asked early on why

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:03,120
the gpl and what i loved about the gpl

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,679
was it solved that worry for me

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,799
which is if microsoft jumped into the

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,159
linux business

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,039
and took all of red hat's code and wrote

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,720
better code

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,760
because after all they're microsoft and

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,440
they must be able to write better code

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,840
uh if they did that um

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,919
how was i going to compete and the nice

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
thing about the gpl is they couldn't do

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,159
it

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,279
without giving me i.e red hat

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,519
their innovations and so suddenly

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,000
microsoft is part of the community

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,279
because of the gpl and the viral nature

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,880
of the gpl

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:44,480
so red hat became strong uh uh

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,399
what uh uh the even

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,200
evangelist that's the word i was looking

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,000
for evangelist of the gpl

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,360
because it protected us from any much

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,279
bigger competitor coming

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,960
in and unfairly competing with us on it

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,320
plus of course it made us part of the

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,519
community

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,080
other engineers working on other tools

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,720
were happy to sell share their tools

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,880
with us

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
because we shared everything we were

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,440
writing with them

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,200
under the gpl the funny little story was

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,039
i told you about meeting

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
uh richard stallman i meet richard

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,240
stoneman several years later at a

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,080
conference

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,240
and red hat's now doing really really

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,600
well so red hat's now the leading linux

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,760
distribution

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,200
everyone's a little worried about red

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,320
hat you know they're going no

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,360
red hat has too much market share red

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,799
hat are the microsoft of the linux space

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,880
and of course i'd say no we aren't the

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,360
microsoft of the linux space

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
we give every line of code we write away

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,880
for free

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,240
we can't beat the microsoft of the linux

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,039
space

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,240
we might be the market leaders as the

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,960
market leaders

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,720
maybe we're going to do bad things but

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,960
whatever bad things we do

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,919
isn't going to be microsoft's bad things

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,799
because we can't

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,159
we don't have microsoft's rules working

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,840
for us

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,679
so so anyway i meet richard stallman

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,399
richard treats me like that he goes you

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,440
know bob uh

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,440
you know you know your your red hat

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,080
thing really isn't very good for free

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
software

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
linux and you know i'm worried that

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,640
you're gonna

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,240
take all of us down a really bad path

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,000
one of these days

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,039
and i go richard i am more committed

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,799
to free software than you are

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,960
of which of course takes some of that

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,880
that's not possible this guy's an evil

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,720
capitalist businessman he says so

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
himself

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,919
and i go the reason i'm more committed

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,559
than you are

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,600
is you believe in free software you

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,120
believe it

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,960
as an ideology but the problem is you

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
could wake up tomorrow morning

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,640
and you could have a eureka moment and

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,440
go oh i've been wrong

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,159
and you can simply change your mind and

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,880
not do

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,960
free software open source anymore and go

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,039
to work at microsoft

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,200
whereas my business model my customers

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,399
are completely dependent on my

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,440
commitment

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,480
to open source and free software

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,839
i can't wake up tomorrow

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,159
i'm stuck unlike you you can you you can

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,320
go

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,280
to the bahamas and sell proprietary

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
software

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,040
i'm stuck selling free software until

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,960
the end of time

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,159
and one of the great pleasures is of

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,760
course

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,200
red hat now as part of ibm is still

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,200
giving away all the code they write

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,159
so that's kind of the whole theme

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,960
of of my talk is is don't be

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
insular in your business planning be

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,720
clever in your business

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
planning and if like me you're not a

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,240
clever person

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,639
go and find clever people because and

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,000
make

00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,400
friends because clever people like

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,200
being asked for their advice and they'll

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,359
tell you

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,320
how to do it if you're not smart enough

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,680
and i'm not smart enough which is why

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
john hall is a friend of mine

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,920
but the real trick is is as much as you

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
can be open with your customers treat

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,560
your customers as part of the journey

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
because they are part of the journey

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,440
they are why you get out of bed in the

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,280
morning

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,359
and if they're not why you get out of

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,960
bed in the morning

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,720
you're in the wrong business or you

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,079
shouldn't be in business at all i

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,200
suppose

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,200
okay beth lynn that's about it for my

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,000
formal presentation do you have any more

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,000
questions for me

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,440
warner has some questions from the

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,440
audience warner

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,160
uh sure i'll join why not well thanks so

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,760
much

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,599
bob i really appreciated your thoughts

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:04,400
and your perspective super valuable

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,240
wow my whole chat is very

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,960
happy oops sorry i didn't mean to speak

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,720
over you not at all no worries next

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
in fact i i think you've been uh

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,599
preparing uh all the

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,720
questions now so we'll take uh take some

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,200
time as much

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,119
uh reasonably as much time uh bob and

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,760
mad dog

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,119
wrap up with questions here yeah thank

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
you so much and

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,560
bob one one of the things that you said

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,200
that really spoke to me was

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,880
when you share your ip your customers

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,040
become your fans

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,119
that really resonated with me i thank

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,599
you very much for saying that

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,440
oh it john can speak to that that was

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,599
probably the single most

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,000
motivating thing in the early days at

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,560
red hat we had no money

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,520
uh you know we were running up credit

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,560
card charges

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
just to keep our bills paid yeah

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,240
it should have been a very stressful

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,800
time except

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,480
there were so many people who genuinely

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,480
wanted us to succeed

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,240
in a way that i'd never experienced

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,960
before uh that it was

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,359
it was truly a pleasure so i have to

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,440
tell

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,520
one story and this was at a unix expo

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,040
in new york city at the javits

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,200
auditorium

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,280
and red hat decided that they were going

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,560
to come up there and have a little 10 by

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,599
10 booth

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,520
which was just some bookshelves some

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,480
folding bookshelves were put together

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,000
and a red and white checkered tablecloth

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,520
and they were putting boxes

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,240
of their software on there to sell

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,440
because if they didn't sell that

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,200
software

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,320
at the show they didn't have enough

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,599
money to get back to north carolina

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,079
and bob i i was a digital we had a big

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,480
booth

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,079
i came over to say hello and i said

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,000
let's go out to dinner bob says well i

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,560
have some business things to do

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,240
he peels off two 20 dollar bills he

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,839
gives one to donny barnes and went to

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,280
eric drone and says

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,119
make this last and i knew that wasn't

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,480
even enough money to get us downtown in

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,040
a taxi cab

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,320
so digital equipment corporation on my

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,079
expense account

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,760
took us all out to dinner we had a great

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
time and

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,040
that was a great evening a really nice

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,839
evening

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,400
but bob was right i wanted to see red

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,880
hat succeed

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,839
thank you mad dog and now you understand

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
why we all

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,000
loved you is you had a digital equipment

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,960
company

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,680
expense account

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,640
the jig is up however many years later

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,440
now you know

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
well and when and and it goes back the

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,920
other way

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,400
when we did the alpha linux port

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,240
it was red hat that took all the

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,440
distribution and put it together and put

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,720
it on

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,800
cds to sell to our customers

00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,640
who bought alpha systems so

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,119
and i took i i paid red hat to generate

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,640
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,760
000 cds that had red hat and digital's

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,800
logo on it

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,599
but was intel and i gave those away to

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,839
people and said

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,119
if you like these on your intel machine

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,000
you'll love

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,760
the red hat alpha distribution for an

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
alpha

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
so mad dog i have a story for you that i

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,079
bet you don't even know

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,000
which is that when we did the the alpha

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,560
distribution there was a lot of work

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,520
we we had done obviously the intel

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,640
version

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,480
uh we did a sun microsystems uh spark

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,440
version uh and there was a lot of

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,680
pushback among the engineering team

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,880
who shall remain nameless these are

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,599
friends of yours so

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,520
just did while you pull the knives out

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,280
of your back mad dog

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,000
that's why i won't tell you who these

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,800
guys were who were saying bob

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,800
we're not going to sell any of these

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
alpha versions you know deck's going to

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,000
sell these alphas for a gazillion

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,119
dollars

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,720
each machine is going to need one copy

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,599
of red hat linux it's

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,599
free software so if even if they buy two

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,880
machines they only have to buy one

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,079
fifty dollar you know sort of cd

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,839
of of alpha linux why are we do we

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,560
should not be doing this we should be

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,520
putting that

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,079
engineering effort into making our intel

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,920
version

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:30,000
better and i pulled rank i did not pull

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,280
rank very often to this very day

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,119
i try and avoid ever pulling rank in any

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,079
of the businesses i'm involved in in

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,400
other words

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,760
if i can't convince my colleagues to do

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
something we don't

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,800
do it because they're smarter than i am

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,359
but every now and again there's

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,599
something on which i feel very strongly

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,119
and i have a real vision and i will say

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,040
notwithstanding

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,200
you guys are probably right we're still

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,480
gonna do this and that was one of those

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,440
times

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,000
and the reason for it uh john and this

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,599
played

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
very well for us in the end is by having

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,920
a

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,040
intel distribution and a solaris or a

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,560
sunspark version and an alpha version

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,240
it made us look like the market leaders

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,640
in the linux world

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,800
even when we weren't the market leaders

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,160
in the linux world because no one else

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,440
had a son or

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,160
alpha version uh it played very well in

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,800
the end

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,319
but uh but i didn't know if he actually

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,880
knew that

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,880
the alpha version was what was my thank

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,920
you for your support

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,160
and a very strategic play so it should

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,640
warn you we're enjoying your stories a

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,240
lot

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,000
so but we will um we've been allowing

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,720
the clock to run some which we're

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,760
perfectly okay with but i i just want to

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,880
acknowledge that

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,920
to be respectful of your time as well

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,200
we're we're probably targeting ending uh

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,920
in the next 20 minutes or so i i did

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,480
notice uh

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,680
one question from the audience here in

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,200
zoom

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,160
and this is from chris punches and he's

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,040
asking bob

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,240
if you have any thoughts on how up and

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,720
coming

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,160
linux distributions can get a company

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,440
built around them or

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,720
funded oh dear

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,640
uh that's a 20 minute question exactly

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,000
it's 20 minutes the good news the oh

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,839
dear was

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,440
uh i don't actually have an answer to

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,560
that and the reason for it is

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,720
i've been out of linux and open source

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,319
so one of the reasons why i'm the

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,680
world's worst student

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,839
is as near as i can tell back in the

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,760
1960s

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,319
i had what is today known as hd

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,280
anyways uh add this is how i know it

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,200
uh so my ability to focus on any one

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,800
thing for more than five minutes at a

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,599
time is somewhat limited

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,560
we call it squirreliness there you go

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
i've had a

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,680
couple of colleagues who refer to my

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,599
behavior as

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,599
as yeah dogs chase lovingly

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,839
so and the story is the reason i got

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,400
into lulu and self-publishing and the

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,319
reason i

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,319
then got into uh

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,720
sports and now i'm actually getting into

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,520
blockchain technologies uh

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,480
is because i get bored and and i did the

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,160
whole open source

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
linux thing and now there's so many

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,359
smarter people than me working in that

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,400
field

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,319
that that i haven't been keeping up so i

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,040
apologize i don't have a good answer

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,520
there

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,640
could i could i give a try on that oh of

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,839
course yeah

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,000
my feeling is that these days you know

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,680
if you're starting up a new distribution

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,880
and you're expecting to make a business

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,200
out of that you're into

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,319
very very tough competition from a whole

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,440
bunch of other

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,200
linux distributions and what bob was

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
talking about of having

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
your customers appreciate what you're

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,119
doing for them

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,319
is very important but i've been saying

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,960
to people lately

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,359
people don't buy computers they don't

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,200
buy

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,760
software what they're buying is a

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,240
solution to a problem they have

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,280
and so if you go up a level and say that

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,640
you're not starting

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,000
a linux distribution company but instead

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,359
you're using linux

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,560
to solve a problem or or create another

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,800
product which is

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,000
up higher then that is the thing which

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,720
they would be buying

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,400
right and so now you're not competing on

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,079
a linux distribution basis you're

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,119
competing on a solution basis

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,560
john i cannot support that answer

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,880
more uh that's a hundred percent true

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,599
for

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,400
everyone in business at all times

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,960
whether

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,920
you're working at uh general motors or

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,000
whether you're running your own business

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,760
what you're selling the details of what

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,440
you're selling your customer

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,920
could care less about what your customer

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,839
wants

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,079
is something that makes their life

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,119
better and if you can articulate

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,680
how your product not the details of your

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,800
product

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,079
but the benefit of your product makes

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,480
the world a better place

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,800
you'll be a hero at general motors and

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,040
your business will do well

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
and the thing is if you're talking about

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,319
open source

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
versus closed source bob was talking bob

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,720
and i were talking about this the other

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,839
day

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:34,240
the issue there is not freedom

00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,440
necessarily but control

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,359
your business you need to have control

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,200
of getting fixes done you need to have

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,720
control of extending the software you

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,160
need to have control

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,640
of being able to put together the

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,040
solution for your customer

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,160
and that's where free software really

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,079
shines

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,960
okay and if you think about it ibm

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,720
25 years ago was selling hardware

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,680
mainframes and software

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,640
mvs and stuff like that they sold off

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,160
their laptop

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,760
and their small server division to

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,319
lenovo

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,040
and they and they bought

00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:11,119
pricewaterhousecooper which is a

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,040
solutions business

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,800
because they realize that the profit

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,839
margin on solutions

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,119
is 19 20

00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,680
versus the profit margin on uh

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,720
laptops and small servers is only two to

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,640
three percent

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,160
and they couldn't survive one two to

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,040
three percent

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,960
and so now when you walk through a

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,000
airport and you see an advertisement

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,000
from ibm

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,960
all it says is ibm business solutions

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,960
that's what they sell

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,599
great thoughts uh really great thoughts

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,440
i like to call it technology with a

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,400
market problem

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,640
in entrepreneurship typically you're

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,839
solving a market market problem that's a

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,359
viable business

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,200
um nixie i i know you add at least maybe

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,079
a question or two that you might want to

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,599
highlight from

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,640
our friends on the internet at large

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,200
uh okay so this one

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,119
is for tiger cat i'm gonna call you that

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,319
now

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,040
i was like this is just our little

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,480
secret and those on youtube and the zoom

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,880
chat now your tiger cat forever um

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,520
are you familiar with the uh right to

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,680
repair

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,119
movement so the right to repair any of

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,000
your technology

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,599
um modify it and how do you feel what

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,079
are both of your feelings

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,359
i'm cool with just applying the question

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,880
to both

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,680
okay so i'll pass it to john after this

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,040
uh if someone is working in that field

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,960
and they want some help

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,200
again bob at lulu.com because i

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,240
it's the right thing for us to do you're

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,240
beginning to see

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,079
some of our politicians actually

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,280
understand the problem

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,920
uh but yeah it's a big part of

00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,040
why open source was such an important

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,079
movement

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,119
uh talking about ibm so john was

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,559
using a good example of ibm's being

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,920
the good guy ibm is actually the bad

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,800
guy that that helped red hat be wildly

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,520
successful

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:20,160
don't get me wrong so uh

00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,720
1964 thomas watson jr so

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,240
he had taken over the ceo job at ibm

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,520
from his dad

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,720
um uh who was thomas clarkson senior

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,400
obviously um

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:36,160
and junior realized that ibm had

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,640
a a monopoly on computers uh business

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,079
computers at the time their 360 was a

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,079
huge success

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,319
and they were putting all the dwarfs

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,440
this is more than you want to know but

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,720
dwarfs were

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,680
i'll let mad dog but there was am doll

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,480
and honeywell and a bunch of other guys

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,680
anyway um

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,040
so they owned the space and watson jr

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,280
realized

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,200
sorry prior to that software had been

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,839
given away for free

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,200
in order to sell computers to sell

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,319
hardware

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,200
watson realized that if he only gave

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,920
away the

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,480
binaries and retained the source code

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,119
and gave away the binaries on a license

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,400
that required the customer

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,599
to pay ibm money for any changes to

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,359
those binaries

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,160
ibm would have a whole new revenue

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:30,079
stream and that's how it played out

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,960
but watson it invented the proprietary

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,280
software business out of whole cloth and

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,280
as

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,960
as we used to explain when we were doing

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,280
our road show and

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,119
you know the investors who were going to

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,040
invest in the red hat ipo couldn't

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,960
understand what we were doing and

00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,880
why weren't we doing this proprietary

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,640
thing that everyone else was doing

00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,920
and i would tell that story and i would

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,319
explain that

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,720
in fact what watson had done was an

00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,240
evolutionary dead end

00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,400
and the end of that evolutionary dead

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,440
end had just arrived

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,800
and the end of it was open source and

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,440
free software

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,520
because in an interconnected world

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,920
customers had to have the ability to

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,640
connect their machines to each other

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,839
without

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,680
a vendor's oversight that's why open

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,680
source had to succeed

00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,160
it was it was a good sales pitch at the

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,240
time it's still a good sales page

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,760
wow it's nice that you're intersecting

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,359
in that moment where you

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,000
had the knowledge at that moment to

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,960
convey that sentiment

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,200
but the right to repair movement falls

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,280
into exactly the same category

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,280
and that's why i'm a big fan of everyone

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,960
who's pushing on the right to repair

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,000
uh movement yeah so i will i will add a

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,119
little bit to that

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,480
because i started programming in 1993

00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,400
i was 1973 at atlanta live in casualty

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,960
that was the largest commercial user of

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,520
ibm equipment in the free world

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,200
and what happened in those days is that

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,880
we got one of the first

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,920
amdahl computers that was ever created

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,000
and amdahl had worked for ibm

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,920
and amdahl had created a computer that

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,920
was binary compatible that was

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,760
completely hardware compatible with the

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,440
ibm mainframe

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:20,720
and we just took our the ibm software

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,800
and put it on there binary compatible

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,960
and it worked so what ibm was doing was

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,200
creating the software for the amdahl

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,880
hardware

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,280
back in those days there was no

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,440
copyright or even or patents that could

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,680
be applied to software

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,160
that all happens during the gaming

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,720
industry when game companies came out

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,480
with the roms if you remember the roms

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,800
they had the ones and zeros for the

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,839
interesting yeah so what was happening

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,119
was competitors of gaming companies

00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,760
would

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,599
duplicate the board but it was too hard

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,119
to duplicate the software that was

00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,839
inside the rom

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,480
so the the companies that created that

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,200
software

00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,240
wanted protection from people just

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,400
copying it

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,520
and that's where they applied software

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,920
copyright

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:14,319
you know type stuff right and later on

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,520
that that copyright was extended to

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,599
source code

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,520
of people because originally it was only

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,040
the binaries the ones and zeros that

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,200
came out of that but eventually it was

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,559
applied to source code

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,119
so yeah bob and i agree with you

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,079
i think that closed source binary

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,280
software

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,960
is actually an anomaly that happened at

00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,000
a point in time

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,760
and eventually is going to move to free

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,160
software

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,960
it's interesting from like a consumer

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,839
persp

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,480
perspective where you see more of

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,160
proprietary stuff

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,079
and you don't really see the frontward

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,000
facing of the openness of it

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,319
because every time i have the

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,359
conversation usually the dialogue goes

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,640
very similarly

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:01,040
that um you had bob with you know uh

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,800
stallman about and actually this is one

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,880
of the questions how did you reconcile

00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,200
people saying free software is not a

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,160
good

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,839
business model and i would be interested

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,400
to hear you dig in a little bit more on

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,960
that

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,079
for both of you okay it's actually it's

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,359
actually a very quick

00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,160
answer uh that people overlook all the

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,280
time and again

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,319
another good ibm story um

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,559
uh and lou gerstner if you remember ibm

00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,240
no you don't you're much too young uh in

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,200
the 1980s my dad worked for dec

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,400
he took a severance package right before

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,640
they switched to digital

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,640
or switched to intel because he thought

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,000
that uh digital was going under

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,079
and he said it was like the worst

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,319
mistake of his life and he said it

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,200
all the way up until you know the day he

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,079
passed

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,839
because it was just yeah so your dad

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,319
will know this story then so in the

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,040
1980s ibm was on its lot

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,079
last legs the board reached outside and

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,040
brought in a guy called

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,040
lou gerstner lou gerstner was a customer

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,599
guy and he did all the right things he

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,240
sat down with ibm's major customers

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,880
he was the one when mad dog talks about

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,640
ibm selling solutions

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,880
it was gerstner who understood that

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,119
ibm's customers were loyal to ibm

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,319
because of ibm services not because of

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,880
their products

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,800
so yeah uh we were reading about this

00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,000
early on in the red hat thing because we

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,760
were making a little bit of money

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,040
selling red hat cds but we were sort of

00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,440
wondering how big

00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,920
could this business get and what was our

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,720
business model going to be

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,400
once the internet connections were fast

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,720
enough that you didn't need to

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,319
buy linux on a cd you could just

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,040
download it

00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,920
our business in the early 90s was thanks

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,520
to 14

00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,480
for modems because you couldn't download

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,520
a gigabyte worth of software on a 14

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,920
4 modem so people would pay us for cds

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,559
but we could see the end of that

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,160
so what was our business and we read

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,200
making an elephant dance

00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,000
uh gerstner's book where he articulated

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,400
this

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,640
that it's not about the hardware or the

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,200
product it's about the services

00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,960
so we looked okay we're going to sell

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
operating systems we're going to sell as

00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,359
many of them as

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,319
as microsoft does because we give ours

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,280
away for free

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,000
whereas microsoft charge a lot of money

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,720
so we're not

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
gonna make microsoft's 44 billion

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,359
dollars worth of

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,720
license sales but we might make

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,799
some share of microsoft's five billion

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,400
dollars worth of services

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:38,559
around there we go the five billion

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,480
dollar market is big enough for us so we

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,400
were happy to give the software away

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,559
in order to build a customer base and a

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,760
following so that we could sell

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,280
services around the software he gave

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,680
away for free

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,520
and that's exactly red hat's business

00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,760
model to this very day

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,920
it took much smarter people than me it

00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,040
took guys like matthew zulick and

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,559
and uh yeah

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:07,440
and the the subsequent uh red hat teams

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,280
to actually execute that vision i'm not

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,680
smart enough to do that

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,040
uh but that was in fact the model we

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,480
adopted back in

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,839
95 and it's uh it holds up it definitely

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,200
holds up because i know

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,280
um red hat employees that to this day

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,359
say that that you guys support even the

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,640
most obsolete versions

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:29,040
of that of the software on you know even

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,200
if

00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,880
one person even if one person has that

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,400
version you guys will support it with

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,440
the red hat service

00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,520
so i know as well as they can they're

00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,520
doing as much as they can there but like

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,119
everyone else at some point you have to

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,200
call it quits

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,599
but i have to point this out because

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,520
that was one part of bob's contribution

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,079
to it but i think there was another part

00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,240
that was

00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,520
very important and that was bob's

00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,240
realization

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,720
that linux was like ketchup and he

00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,359
wanted red hat to be hines

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
that's right that's right so yeah if i

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,440
could tell this story

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,760
so people would keep asking me you know

00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,880
and

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,000
i i had to get away from binaries and

00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,319
source code

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,880
and gpl licenses because these people

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:17,280
were not technical people and if i

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,480
said any of those words they would go to

00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,400
sleep on me

00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,400
and i didn't want them to go to sleep on

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,559
me so i did things like well

00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,640
we're sort of like the legal system you

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,000
know if a lawyer makes his case in front

00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,920
of the supreme court

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,480
using a completely unique new argument

00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,640
every other lawyer is allowed to use

00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,520
that argument without so much as asking

00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,559
permission that's how our legal system

00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,960
works

00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,319
and there's lots of big law firms making

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,640
lots of money

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,240
my joke was not enough people are suing

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,440
us so we didn't really want to follow

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,920
the law firms

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,880
so then i i would pull out the ketchup

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,720
one

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,319
and and here's the ketchup story which

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,440
is if you

00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:01,200
if you how did heights get 60 of the

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,520
ketchup business

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,119
and you know that people the americans

00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,160
will tell you it's because heinz tastes

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,640
better

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,760
but actually they did a study they took

00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,799
heights and hunts

00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,839
and del monte to the to the

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:17,280
primitive tribes somewhere uh and they

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,040
discovered two things

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,960
they discovered that humans don't

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,720
actually like ketchup

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,559
and the other thing they discovered is

00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,839
they dislike all ketchups

00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,240
equally so then it goes how did heights

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,960
get

00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,559
sixty percent of the market and how do

00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,960
americans believe that heights taste

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:37,599
better and the answer is

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,400
that heights has built over the last

00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,920
whatever it is

00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,839
60 70 100 years uh a

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,520
reputation for quality and consistency

00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,680
of their recipe

00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,040
and over time they have built this

00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,520
position

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,799
based on quality and consistency to the

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,960
point where

00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,200
americans when they taste ketchup if it

00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,319
does not taste like heights it is not

00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,359
good ketchup and yet

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,920
and yet ketchup you can make it in your

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,079
kitchen

00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,520
sink without so much as a bending a

00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,960
copyright rule it's just

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,680
tomatoes and vinegar and spices

00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,480
so how does heights get 60 and maintain

00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,599
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:23,280
of the market on what is basically a

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,599
free software like commodity

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,079
of you know in red hat's case we have

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:31,599
the x window system and send mail

00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,880
and gnome and we just pull it together

00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,359
and anyone can do that

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,160
so how did red hat get its market share

00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:39,440
and it was

00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,440
exactly the same way

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,359
i shouldn't say exactly as as close to

00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,520
the heights model as we could get

00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,280
your marketing is pretty good but i'd

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,240
say there's a little more value than

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,440
just the marketing

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,440
and red hat's case but it's true for

00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,680
heights as well they have big labs they

00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,760
do a lot of research into

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,960
how to get people to like their ketchup

00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,920
even more

01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,400
but take a look at coca-cola coca-cola

01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,920
was

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,280
the soda right and they made a big

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,319
stumble when they brought out

01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,240
new coke it was a very big stumble it

01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,200
gave away huge amounts of market share

01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,000
to pepsi

01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,200
because it violated the it always tastes

01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,079
the same

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,480
ironically if you look very closely at

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,680
coca-cola they change the recipe

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,000
very slowly over time so slowly that

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,680
people

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,680
don't realize it's changing

01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,440
you can all eat a hamburger in

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,280
mcdonald's anywhere in the world and it

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,160
tastes very similar if not the same

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,520
standardization

01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,000
i'd really love to have these

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,319
conversations all night but i i do want

01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,799
to be respectful of people's time and

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,599
i think now is probably a good time to

01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,200
wrap up

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:56,720
and do our closing ceremony so

01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,319
great that mad dog my my wife nancy is

01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,880

01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,880
