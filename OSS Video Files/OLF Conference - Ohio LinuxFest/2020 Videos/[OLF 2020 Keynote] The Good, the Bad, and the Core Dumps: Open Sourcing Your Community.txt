Nixie Pixel has been a tech media personality, producer and early adopter of a little known platform at the time called YouTube. 10 years later, she’s grown her brand by educating, entertaining and helping new users make the switch to Linux. She was the first person to bring Linux to the Discovery Channel Network, and prior to that, was a show host for Tech TV.
