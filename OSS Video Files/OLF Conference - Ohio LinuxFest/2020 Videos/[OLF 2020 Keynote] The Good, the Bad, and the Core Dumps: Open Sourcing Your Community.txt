switch to linux

that share values for social good

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,520
i've watched nixie's pixels

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,479
youtube's for many years and even though

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
i wasn't a known friend to her yet she

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,560
has been a friend to me

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
and i am delighted that the virtual

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
experience

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,960
this year has provided an opportunity

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,320
for nixie to collaborate with olf

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,119
conference and

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,240
she's here for you she's here for me

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,840
nixie

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,840
i'll turn it over to you

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,960
hello all this is nixie in the not so

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
distant

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,000
past coming to you to talk about how

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,039
you build open communities and i decided

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
to come to you from a slightly before in

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
the past

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
because i am also simultaneously hosting

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
this on my youtube channel and i didn't

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
want anything to blow up

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,959
or core dump which is exactly what we're

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,120
talking about

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,959
in the talk so let's go through together

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
so you want to build an open source

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,360
community great

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,560
i did too and we learned a lot through

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,280
many years so i'm nixie

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
and let's just kind of go back to the

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,800
roots of everything right

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,080
so olf is built on a lot of this

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
very similar tenants that the fsf is and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
if you had been here for previous days

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
of the conference they really

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
um talked about these tenants so you

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
know free as in free speech

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
not as in free beer guess who said that

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
right

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
and that's all about community and i've

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,159
had some variation

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,080
of open community running projects for

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,200
seven years now i think

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,280
um yeah so

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
you have to forgive me i'm gonna put my

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,080
webcam away in some of this

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,120
uh there we go

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
um and so basically you want to have the

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,159
liberties and personal freedoms to run a

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
program

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,400
study and modify a program change and

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,480
improve on the software

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
and basically as i like to say

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,159
affectionately in tron

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,360
fight for the users all right

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
so i want to ask you guys a fun little

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
game

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
which projects do you think are open

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,640
okay if you guessed

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,120
these you would be right and honestly

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,080
i was pretty impressed with the amount

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,599
of projects that are open nowadays

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,000
i'm pretty excited um with

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,439
you know open source on the horizon oh

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we can't forget gobot

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
they are great for mechanical ngs and i

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
love their sense of humor

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
they actually have an intense robotics

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,320
framework

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
called cylon

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,919
all right

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
so who am i i am nixie pixel my last

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
name is

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,800
pixel i swear um

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,560
basically i have been on the internets

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,479
for quite a long time

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,360
and i have traditional education in

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,800
video production so i have a passion for

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
open source i had a traditional

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,639
education in video production

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
i tried to get that to go together as

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,680
many times as humanly possible

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
and because of that i ended up on tv

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,440
shows such as tech tv

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
if you've ever heard of screen savers or

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,680
call for help

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,000
chris pirillo leo laporte yeah so

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,919
those are some good old throwbacks and i

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,880
was actually the first person

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,280
to bring linux to the discovery channel

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,199
and

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
possibly the last person to do that as

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,520
well i

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,240
definitely decided that i wanted to go

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
my own route and so i founded

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
two companies one of them was geek

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,919
beacon we are

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
currently a non-profit a collective in

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,440
fact

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
and we are an open community of geeks

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
and

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,759
my prior company to that i founded was a

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
blockchain based company called equity

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,240
games where we put

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
digital assets like little games on the

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
blockchain

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,840
so that was a little bit about me and i

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
want to talk to you about geek beacon

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,199
though

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
geek beacon is always going to have a

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,280
place in my heart

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
that it we basically it stemmed off of

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,000
that

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,080
influence i guess you could say but

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
there's so much going on right now

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
um we have essentially a collection of

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
over 6000

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,080
geeks and nerds and coders and gamers

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,720
and

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
and creators really and we have game

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,759
nights and actually if you guys were in

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,479
our buffs um

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,400
birds of a feather we hosted it on our

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
platform which i'll talk a little bit in

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
further slides about

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
but um one of the big things that i'm

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,919
really proud of is we've

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
we're open in all things and that's

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,639
including openness of the mind so we

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
have

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
a lot of great neurodiversity support

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
for those

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,720
with what we call squirrely brains or

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
you know neuroatypical people

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
like our squirrel armies what we call

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,919
them

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,720
so um yeah so

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
basically as far as the community is

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,280
concerned

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,120
you know there's tons of different types

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
of communities you know you have a

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
volunteer projects so there's a lot of

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,520
like core elements right

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
um it's like a neighborhood you have

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,800
non-profits

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
and um another thing

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
you have the sense of community which is

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,520
a really good foundational piece

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
and then you have the sense of

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
commonality so you have a

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
set of shared goals and aspirations

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
towards that goal and

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,080
it involves of volunteers with various

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
walks of life

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,000
so this all sounds great right like

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
but we share some all our values and

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,280
goals and aspirations so

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,280
why is it so difficult why is it so hard

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,160
so um i'm gonna kind of go over some

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,280
issues that maybe you also have felt

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,400
in your own community i want to give

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,759
credit to the artist here

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,759
and put me back over here

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,840
all right um so

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,319
personality types you have the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,680
overview so personally personality types

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
are really important because you know

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
you're creating a group and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,400
there are different personalities which

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,440
is why

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,120
i really love i think this this image

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
illustrates it perfectly

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
so you have the cat versus dog

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,120
phenomenon

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,479
the alpha extrovert verb the aspiring

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
writer and philosopher

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
they thrive in group environments and

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
then you know you have

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
the cat the quiet type they they don't

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,560
really

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,120
enjoy speaking on voice and they don't

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,360
necessarily want to talk and text or

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
vice versa maybe it's one or the other

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,199
maybe you know people that don't like

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,759
talking on voice maybe you know people

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,080
that don't like talking in text they

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,279
don't like to speak up in a public forum

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
or group setting

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,120
and they thrive in groups of in

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,919
one-on-ones

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
and i want to really convey that like

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,080
there's no

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,839
downsides these are not negative things

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
really this is just

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,560
um some behavior that's observed i

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,760
actually exhibit both of these

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
categories and

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,279
i can be either or you know there it's

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
just a blend and

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,519
there's no offense to if somebody is an

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,680
introvert or an extrovert

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920
um just is what it is you have to kind

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,279
of deal with it

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,640
so another issue is you have the

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
opinions warriors

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,320
um there's no real consensus that comes

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,800
from all this

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,440
it's kind of like uh you decide in your

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
community

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
all right so i'm gonna decide you know

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
what is the best

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
cms or what what language should we use

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,600
to design this or

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
what project management software should

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
we use or maybe even like

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
what platform should we use for this

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,399
conference right

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,440
um you know it it doesn't really matter

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,200
it just depends on um you know there's

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,519
literally no consensus

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,839
so you have to have massive discussion

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,959
on the pluses of minuses of each one

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
and you honestly don't really know if

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,360
the

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
community members involved would

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,519
actually implement this thing so you

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
know there have been times where

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
we've you know debated them and we've

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
debated the minutia

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
of our website which is terrible by the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,920
way if you want to check out our

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,839
tolerable website it's geekbeacon.org

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
we admit it it's okay it's not offending

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,480
anyone and

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,320
um you know we we wanted to

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
well i'll talk about that actually in

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,920
further slides

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:23,440
but basically we waxed philosophical

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,480
on what type of stack we wanted and

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,279
we came up with the one we have and

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
um we didn't really have anyone that

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
could

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,880
implement action so that there will be

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
solutions i promise to this

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
so there's also issues of having

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,240
different open philosophies right so

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,279
you have open everything which is very

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,640
fsf

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
um i super admire them like everything's

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,079
in the open

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,160
everything is open documentation you

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,440
know everybody also might see your dirty

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,880
laundry everyone might also see childish

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
silly arguments that you've had

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
depending on how open your documentation

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
is

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,640
uh and then you have like google and

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,800
microsoft and the

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
the corporate way which is interesting

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
right because it's

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,200
there's no visibility into anything and

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,079
but it lets you work your tantrum out

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
behind closed doors so that's good and

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,920
it presents the illusion of composure

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,279
and demeanor right so

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,279
at least we look professional

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,240
so another thing would be i keep having

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,959
to move myself around

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
a single point of failure so you know

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,880
where did jane go

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,079
um why has jane or john disappeared

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,839
they're not responding

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,680
do they get a new girlfriend did they

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
get married have a kid getting divorced

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
insert crisis here

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
well you know how dare they not be

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
available right well

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,640
you're working with volunteers so you

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,640
have to keep that in mind too

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,120
and that's also super important

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,639
oops i'm going forward and forward on my

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
slides

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,800
so you can tell i did this quite early

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,200
before um

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,200
yeah so like keep an eye for i think i'm

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,480
just going to get rid of my webcam

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
there we go how dare they not be

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,440
available keep in mind you know you're

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,680
working with volunteers

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
they they donate their time because they

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
believe in the cause um

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,880
and but life always does come first and

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,320
also just keep an eye out for burnout

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
you know be sure to take a break and

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,279
make time

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
for yourself so here's a big disclaimer

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
here

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,440
um we don't have all the answers

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,040
and and what worked for us doesn't mean

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
that it'll work for you that's really

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,519
key here you know

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
look for what's best for your community

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,800
you know we're always looking for better

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
answers and that's also going to come

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,839
later on in the slides

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
so we talk about some of the problems

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
let's talk about some of the solutions

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,519
so

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,000
see if i can get away with putting

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,079
myself up in the corner there um

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
so this is the exciting part right you

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,800
need to really

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,600
over sop is not just for personalities

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,360
right but

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,880
it will also guarantee that your project

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
will continue and

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,200
anyone can pick it up because there's

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,519
strong processes in place right so

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
in those processes and you know it's not

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,880
like

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,440
sexy to talk about processes but you

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
know

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
you want to have requirements on having

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,959
an agenda you want to have

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,399
a time box in your meetings and um

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,040
you know you want to play to those

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,519
personality strengths that's also key

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,040
and basically allow for the text feed

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,519
that's another thing that we did we

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,519
allowed for like people that weren't

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
super comfortable talking voice we also

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,399
had a text feed and

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,360
um vice versa people that didn't want to

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,160
talk in text

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
could jump on our voice channel so just

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
kind of

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
catering to those different personality

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,600
types and

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
the worst case scenario if it is a

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,079
personality type issue just keep them

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,399
apart

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,560
um they still care about what you're

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
trying to go for and you know they still

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,000
want to make progress with you so

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,880
another solution we have for opinions

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,279
warriors

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,440
we have actionable items so if you have

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,839
an opinion that's great

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
um it's really good to have that spidey

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,720
sense where you know

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,839
when an opinion of uh you know

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,040
hey i think we should um

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,040
build an entire um

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,199
you know completely restructure your

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,320
website and make it

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,320
uh make it us into a an

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,839
operational cylon since we were talking

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,399
about cylons before

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,800
well that's cool uh opinions don't

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,800
necessarily matter in all cases

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,480
you can tell me how to do it forever but

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,279
it would be so much better if you just

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,639
showed me

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,440
and also you know uh use the best tool

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,480
for the job

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,800
you may find that you're like again kind

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,160
of digressing over and over again

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,160
and chat we actually are medium is chat

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,000
so it's kind of rough for us

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
we have to constantly take it out of

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,120
that place of

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,519
um temporary temperance or temporariness

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
and put it into a place of persistence

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
um that

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,839
that's really key i actually created

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,959
this little gif

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,880
where it was like hey um are you trying

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,199
to ask me to do something in this chat

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,320
room

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,560
be it slack be it discord irc

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
why don't you make a ticket with that um

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
and that will be coming up soon

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,160
i'll kind of show you the processes that

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,600
we use

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,639
so you have opinion warriors that's fine

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,279
that's cool we love feedback we love

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
ideas

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,440
we love discussions we want to use

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,560
opinion warriors whenever that situation

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
arises

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
when do we not want to use those opinion

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
warriors if we're trying to get

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
something done

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,240
or we need a solution right so um

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,399
make a ticket for that project

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,120
management thing we just talked about or

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
write a blog post or start a project

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,079
create a website

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,600
you know update the github

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,759
you know do something with the repo

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,040
something like that right um

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,959
maybe with your spidey sense you now

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,040
know that's not the best place to use

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,680
your opinion warriors perhaps use them

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,079
in more

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
your ideation phase like your your

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,680
beginning phases which i promise i will

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,560
tie it all together in the end here

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
you know their single point of failure

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
is totally

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,959
scary especially when you're putting a

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,880
lot of volunteer time into a project you

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,920
know do you want to give

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,759
the keys to the kingdom to one

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,399
person only no every lead in your

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
project

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,320
lead needs at least one co-lead and

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,639
every resource

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,000
so like every file for instance one

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
person has access to

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,720
files or drives should have another

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
person that has access in fact

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,759
that's something that we employed even

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,720
with our

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
platform here with olf like we had i

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
like to

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,760
coin the term you know backup and then

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,880
back up your backup and then back up

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,000
again

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,959
um and i'm sure like they probably

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
didn't love me for that but it's really

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,199
cool because you know

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,319
maybe you have to use password

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,360
manager and share credentials um

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,600
and in order to make sure that something

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,200
goes according to plan and that's when

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,000
trust is super important

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,880
you know like uh you want to trust the

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
people

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,120
and earn and establish the trust that

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
you have with your community members

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,799
because these are like your

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,400
you know pop smaller

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,400
there's it's like a family you know it's

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,480
not really like work

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,400
but it's a passion project and you have

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,679
your people that you have with you are

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
like your

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,160
good friends in you know

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,480
in driving towards that

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
carrying the fire towards that passion

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,320
um so

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
that's that's awesome and you know share

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
access and back up everything which is

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,320
exactly what i said previously

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,240
so uh there are no absolutes

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,440
and so the solution for the different

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
philosophy is okay

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,679
um it's keep an open mind you know

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,240
there's there's no wrong answers

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,039
there's no absolutes so somebody likes

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,960
ruby

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
somebody thinks it's overly complicated

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,200
somebody you know

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,039
um codes and only white space which is

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,360
totally a thing

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,480
um you know that's fine it just

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,240
listen to your community get feedback

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,720
survey them make them feel

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
appreciated and like their opinion is

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,440
valid

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:53,039
and valued because you know

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,000
they are and we what we have is called

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,679
uh town hall meetings so we basically

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
have everybody in our community and

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,880
people outside of our community

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,720
come and just like we talk about

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,320
what we're doing next like what are our

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,120
next milestones and

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,679
is this a good thing or does this suck

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,080
and

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,880
so we can kind of peer review it in a

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,200
way we're like

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,240
here's my thought on a project this this

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,720
and this

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
and then you know the public because we

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,080
have town halls

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
we at the end we open the question we

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,320
open questions for the public and

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,480
you know you'd be surprised at what

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
happens with they kind of go like oh i

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,919
never thought of that before

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,039
um have you tried this and it's

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,480
pretty awesome so you know the key is to

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,799
really be able to accept

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,840
criticism um and

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,799
another really important part is when

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,679
you

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,200
decide that you want to choose the

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,799
platform on django

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,080
or you know this this one

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,080
path you know stick with it because

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,280
i think one of the biggest issues i've

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,240
had in my open source community life

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,280
is that we would flip-flop constantly

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
and it's okay

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,159
like you know we would we would i mean

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,760
but our

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:19,200
our progress would show that because

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,960
we would flip-flop and people would

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
only be able to dedicate certain amount

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
of time in one thing and another thing

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,320
and it

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,400
so just stick with it and go for it and

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,200
someone will always be unhappy

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,280
um that the right path is really just

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,080
the one that works for your community

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,679
and you really can kind of like get a

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,640
good sense of that

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,600
and you know the thing that you may not

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
want to hear

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
is that it might not always be open

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,159
source i mean

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,240
you know we are using zoom as a platform

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,919
are we using zoom as a platform because

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,600
we love closed software no

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,200
like we're having a open source

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
conference about you know

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,120
open tools so we're using

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,679
it as a platform because we wanted to

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,840
make sure that we got the conference out

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
and that was the most important thing so

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,240
basically

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,200
keep in mind what the goal is and

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
do your at least for our philosophy for

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,520
geek beacon's philosophy

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,159
is we have this goal and we want to make

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,360
sure that

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,039
what we don't make it overly complicated

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,200
for ourselves so for instance

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,320
we i was a part of hosting another

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,960
conference

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
and being completely open was

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
fundamentally key

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
under no circumstances would we deviate

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
from that

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
and in that case it did hurt us a little

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,720
bit you know and we were able to reflect

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
on that our

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,280
community let us know and being able to

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,760
have that open conversation where

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
you can have that conversation and give

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
the feedback

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,960
is also super vital having postmortems

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,760
when events are done

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,679
um you know or meetings you know

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
reflecting on certain types of meetings

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,720
and

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,000
just really being very introspective

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
with the whole process

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,559
and you know with the previous

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,679
convention i was part of

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,480
because we didn't choose a like closed

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
tool we did end up having like you know

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,600
uh

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,679
an irc uh matrix telegram relay which

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,559
was super cool but also really

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,640
complicated

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,600
and it actually divided our audience

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
into

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,559
multiple groups and not to like talk

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,320
crap about a previous

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,039
thing i was a part of but that's the

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,080
whole point of the learning process

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,200
um so our approach our approach at geek

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,880
bacon

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,679
is not perfect um and i think that

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,159
striving for the utmost of perfection

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,760
will

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,159
just truly truly hurt your project

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,799
and your progress in anything it doesn't

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,360
just

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,200
it doesn't just extend to a community it

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,559
could be any project that you're a part

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,880
of

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
but at geekbean we do try to use open

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
documentation

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
open standards open guidelines whenever

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
possible

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,440
and when in doubt document all the

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,799
things

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,559
we have an open wiki that has

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,080
i have some videos in here i'm gonna

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,440
show you guys we have an

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,000
open wiki we use docusaurus um it's not

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,559
open like wikipedia open like anyone can

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
edit it

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,360
it's open as in like github markdown

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,679
type stuff it's an open notes tool

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
so um we kind of standardize our

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,159
processes that way

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,760
um yeah and so we we put a lot

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,200
i mean we put a this isn't like

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,360
stunning and super you know wow

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,760
i love this but it's so necessary you

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,480
know we we put much of our policies and

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,080
protocols and governance it's not very

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,159
shiny but it shows

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,720
the lead and the co-lead positions for

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,240
instance that we talked about earlier

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,039
um and more of our

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,960
process of how we create events let's

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,440
see if i have

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
okay cool the video is gonna do the

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
thing right

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,840
okay yeah so this is actually our forum

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,799
our forum is open

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,640
um open source and basically we document

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,960
our projects and our events

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,840
and so you can look at the alpha and the

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,360
beta and the

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,080
final forms of you know forming voltron

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,679
to

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
come up with different projects and how

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,760
to work on those projects

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,000
so it's a process in and of itself it's

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,640
really easy but as you can see it worked

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,279
out for our game night for instance

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,039
having those three levels means that say

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
you guys come into our community and you

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,799
want to work on we have somebody who

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
loves ai and wants to work on an ai

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,000
project

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,520
has no idea where to start okay cool

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,640
like if just put it in our

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,080
forum talk about it in an alpha pro like

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,240
an alpha project and

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,159
then as it gets more and more developed

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,240
it just kind of moves along

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,600
its natural transition to a final

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
project which is

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,240
what we were doing with our game nights

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
tonight and the and last night so it was

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,320
really

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,320
it was really cool and it worked for us

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
all right

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,960
it's going to want to show you again so

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
so yeah like even our website is open

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
it's using uh wagtail cms and

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,159
with django as i've mentioned before but

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,960
honestly like in our plight

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
to be open everything we ended up really

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
over complicating it for ourselves and

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
we probably should have just

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,760
chose the better tool for the job

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
because you know

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
what we wanted to do was do a really

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,159
great coven 19

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,640
outreach program and so that was the

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,799
goal

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
that we ended up losing sight of a

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,120
little bit and

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,120
kind of missing the mark

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,480
and again we this is a closed tool we we

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,640
tried taiga

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,760
and other open source project management

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
um but

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,799
tracking tickets is key for progress for

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
us

00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,840
um and trello was easy and that helped

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,679
us make

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,200
a public bounty board that everyone can

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,520
see to help us with

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
those mask bands and our community and

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,279
that that

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,000
was what worked for us again

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,279
so um and this is i don't know if you

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520
guys were a part of

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,760
the shenanigans that happened yesterday

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,799
but this is our discord you know we

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,679
tried to use irc we

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,039
there's a me pointing at the discord

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,400
because i wasn't sure if i was going to

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,320
include my camera

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
as you could see i've had a few snafu's

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,799
with the camera

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,159
already but um yeah we talk about the

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,480
town hall you guys

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,360
might see there and that was really

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
important for us

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,039
because we actually tried a lot of open

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,600
tools we tried

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:50,159
um we we were irc for a really long time

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,840
and then we're scaling a good bit and we

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,440
wanted to try something new so we

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,240
explored matrix

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,440
and matrix was so close but it just

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,400
wasn't there yet

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,760
and so we didn't really choose this tool

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,240
the tool kind of shows

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,880
us and so therefore we have a discord

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,880
now

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,120
and you know there's no shame in that

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,480
for us to have it

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,200
um so our question to you is you know

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,559
do do you have a better way you know

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,760
what has worked for you

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,919
i think it's good just like the pangu

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,799
is you know stumped on things it's just

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
to

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,240
if there's any take away from this talk

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,480
it's just to kind of

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,159
challenge the thoughts and how

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,919
and how like what your philosophy is

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,360
around open source

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,760
and you know how do you apply those

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,120
thoughts into your own communities and

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,720
you know how can you

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,480
run towards you know processes

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
and documentation and ticket tracking

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,200
and

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
everything like that in a way that is

00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,799
most authentic

00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,799
to how to the value proposition of open

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,640
source

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,559
um you know and another question would

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
be how do we make it easier to build

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,919
awesome tools without getting stuck in

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,360
all the mundane details that i just

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,360
talked about previously for

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,720
half an hour um i would love to hear

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,080
some questions to us to geekbeacon i

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
keep saying us but yeah

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,360
open a q a and actually we're going to

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,279
do our own little uh bof and our discord

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,399
if you're curious on what that is it's

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,080
just discord

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,440
um geekbeacon we're a partner discord

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,320
and we would love to have you and um

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,279
yeah so we actually have study groups

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,200
running right now

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,799
we are kind of exploring this really

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,559
cool ai project

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:49,600
where we want to make what i would

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,120
love is to be able to make conferences

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,159
more accessible to people that love open

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,120
source

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,080
so we have a github that actually we

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,720
have a ticket

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
open or we have a alpha project open in

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,760
our forum

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,360
that kind of talks about the beginning

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,159
ideas of how

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,640
a suggestion engine could possibly work

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,919
for

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,960
this um like an open conferences model

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,480
so say

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,080
you know i want to start a conference

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,120
but i don't know where to start

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,760
that was like a huge question mark

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,600
for us as geek begin and perhaps even

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
olf

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,120
it would be great to have a solution for

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,320
that that is open

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,399
so also we need web devs

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
i swear this was not a half an hour talk

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,000
just to explain how

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,080
django didn't work for us and we have a

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,480
broken website and we need web devs it

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,600
just so happened to kind of naturally

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,159
evolve to that all right

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,760
um thank you guys so much for taking the

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,200
time out of your day

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,559
to listen to me jabber on um

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,600
you can check me out at any of these

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,080
i'm key bass i love key bass um if you

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,720
don't enjoy zoom just at least love the

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,200
fact that key bass is now

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
under their umbrella they do great

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,159
authentication

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,440
and they're really good with security

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,440
tools and

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,720
my key bases nixie pixel i'm pretty much

is the following so um i would love to

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,559

big thanks to nixie for sharing her

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,279
thoughts on

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
open communities and certainly all the

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,799
work she's done with

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,279
geek beacon lends us a lot of

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,080
perspective

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,480
fortunately she's not only going to be

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,720
joining us for questions and answers

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,080
she's going to be joining us to co-host

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,080
with us through

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,360
the rest of the program today welcome

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,600
nixie

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,279
hello hello hopefully you can hear me

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,320
okay i'm kind of manipulating two

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,640
different sources at once

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,799
welcome super excited to have you and

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
geek beacon with us today

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,200
i'm gonna step back and leave the mic

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,720
with you and i know beth is going to be

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,760
joining us shortly

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,240
to work with nixie through okay

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,120
sounds good you guys will have to excuse

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,600
me because i

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
am also live on youtube so i'm going to

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,320
be

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,840
putting my eyes over to this side but

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,559
that is just to make sure that

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,919
when that's done i can roll this and

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,159
that and the other thing

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
this guy is really handy by the way

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,399
having a switcher

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,039
i never thought that i would need that

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,559
um

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,480
one of the questions that i it's kind of

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
funny to pull my own questions but

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,039
hopefully um

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,120
you guys are enjoying your conference

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,480
and you'll be cool with me doing that

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,240
um so one of the first questions

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,559
was uh what initially motivated you to

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,960
start using linux in the first place

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,840
and it's kind of a funny thing um around

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
10 years ago

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,240
i decided that i was just going to throw

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,240
any i think that linux is often come

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
comes into play when you have like dying

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,159
beige

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,480
technology that you just want to

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,840
resuscitate and in this case

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:30,000
i decided to just quickly put it up on

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,480
one of my dying laptops and i

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
youtube at the time was a landscape

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,200
where people didn't think about

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,159
monetization

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,399
i don't even think there was a

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,840
monetization model for it but i

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,799
basically just

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,000
revived this dying laptop and i um i

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,559
think it was really close to

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,200
thanksgiving and i was recording it

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,480
for youtube on you know i don't know 800

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,480
by 600

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,640
really tiny window and um

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,080
yeah i i put it on youtube it was one of

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,880
my first videos and

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,320
they essentially i got tons of feedback

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,200
from people from

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,000
india for instance saying that thank you

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,399
so much for

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,880
showing me how to install linux because

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,480
we have tons of hardware

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,000
but we don't have the like actual

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,840
operating system like we can't afford

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,720
the operating system and i'm just like

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,120
wow if this can be implemented in this

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,159
like

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,320
use case then i would love to just keep

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,080
learning and keep talking more about it

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,960
and so that's what i did

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,760
and i've been doing it for around 10

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
years or so

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,240
and i'm pretty happy with it so

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,559
um i think just to speak on

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,799
some of my previous presentation uh

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,799
i i've oh i've never purported myself to

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,679
be like a power user of linux

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,559
um and you know you'll see in the coming

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,600
up talks like

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,039
it'll be fairly more advanced but

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,600
my role really is to try to get

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,240
linux is more of an end user experience

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,080
and

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
it's really unfortunate that you have

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,000
things like

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,960
i think they did a news article or they

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,280
did like they put

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,800
ubuntu in the news where it showed this

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,079
struggling college girl

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,000
who had ubuntu installed by default on

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,320
um you know their os's for instance and

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,159
uh she she ended up flunking out of

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,440
college because of ubuntu so

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,359
it's really weird how um you know linux

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,240
can get a bad rap but it's

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,599
a lot more user-friendly than most

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,399
people realize and i guess

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,240
that's that's why i'm here and that's

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,440
kind of the place that i'm

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,359
coming from the most um

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,520
yeah i actually have i don't know if

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,720

so that i can um start to

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:14,160
use the masks with free software we've

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,320
converted our website a couple years

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,320
back to wordpress and it was really the

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,440
best decision ever

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,880
and it's so wonderful that we're

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,760
going to be able to work with the

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,160
woocommerce plug-in

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,440
and utilize more free software

to deliver to

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,839
our community i'm so incredibly thrilled

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,960

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,839
successfully merged

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,599
because practically i came on here in

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,640
the zoom chat and then answered

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,480
questions

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,880
while i was still presenting in youtube

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,760
so yeah i just need to make sure we're

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,320
everything's copacetic there all of you

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,839
got

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,839
the um message from

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,640
dorothy gordon she's the

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,640
delegate to the united nations who

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,359
joined us yesterday about

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,800
the sustainable development goals and

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,320
how that relates to

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:32,000
her work with lpi and

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,720
free software and it

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,560
was really great to have her back today

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,079
hi dorothy

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:44,720
and to be able to to see you

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:48,079
from your perspective from the

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,280
greater san francisco area to be able to

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,400
say yeah or we we dig free software over

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,680
our um part of the world too

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,440
yeah i i i definitely want to

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,200
touch on i think we don't have too much

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,599
time until you have to introduce colin

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,839
but

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,320
just to give a nod back to the fact that

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
you guys used wordpress i think

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,720
that um you know you you end up well

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,320
is wordpress open wordpress is

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,560
yeah wordpress is open yeah so i

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,320
i kind of think um just going back to

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,160
the web dev woes

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,760
i think that that might be our next

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,560
route for the struggle that we've had

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,599
for our website so far

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,359
but yeah um i think i will uh

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,040
let you guys introduce colin if you

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,760
don't mind and um

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,400
i probably will uh i actually have to

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,440
push

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,359
the presentation again through my side

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,720
uh because so it doesn't go

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,960
um yeah we'll see if uh but

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:54,400
what was three cheers open broadcasts

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
uh software i i'm really impressed in

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,960
how

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,720
it's working and bringing um

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,079
the entire video production

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,040
back to our virtual audience

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,760
i'm just so incredibly tickle frank oh

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,319
yeah

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,040
it's i have to say it's a challenge to

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,520
not

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,319
have been i don't normally do live

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,040
streams

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,520
and then i've not synced up the the zoom

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,520
experience before so this is like

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,000
i feel like i'm back in the days of old

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,400
when i was a master control operator for

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,079
for a television station and i had all

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,720
these bells and whistles and things like

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,800
that but

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,319
um speaking of bells and whistles if you

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,920
hear a lot of honking

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,079
we don't need to talk about why there's

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,920
a lot of a lot of car horns honking in

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,720
celebration outside but that's happening

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,040
so i apologize in advance

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,079
i was like this can be a politics-free

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,599
zone um

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,520
but yeah um

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,440

some of your favorite

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,520

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,800

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,200
completely

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,119
astounded me is that

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:19,440
we had um put an open call out

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,480

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,119
development

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,400
goals and figure out how

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,880
do the values of freedom apply to each

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,839
of them

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,200
in which ways can free software even

00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,240
free hardware or

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,240
other creative uh

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:46,960
commons license or other free license

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,440
can help achieve these sustainable goals

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,720
yeah absolutely can you explain a little

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,680
bit what you mean by like

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,960
sustainable for from the audience that

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,480
just joined

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,880
oh fantastic questions so the

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,440
sustainable

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,720
development goals of the united nations

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,480
are to recognize that

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:14,160
global property is still an issue

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,040
and is a particular issue in developing

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,400
nations

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,960
it is not politically correct to call it

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,079
that

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,079
but some people may think of

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:29,280
these nations as third world countries

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,800
right yeah the goal

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,400
is to elevate these countries

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:41,040
into being a developed nation

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:44,480
but doing that in a responsible way

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:48,079
where you are ethically not

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,319
violating things like planet earth

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:55,359
so also as ethically

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,480
uh making sure that we do not vow

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,119
uh look at it as

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,240
taking away people's freedoms to try to

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,359
expedite

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,400
the delivery into

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:11,680
the developed world nation

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,319
by making it a um

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,400
a choice of whether or not you want

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,040
software freedom or if you want to be a

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,440
developed

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,319
nation no you can do both and you can

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,359
review both

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,800
faster with free software as

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,359
i believe yeah that's that's something

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,640
um

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,200
that's really interesting that you

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,560
mention that because uh i

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,520
i've had the experience of dealing with

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,520
a lot of companies in um in these

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,240
developing areas especially when i was a

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,200
part of

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,720
the blockchain world and one of the

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,760
things that i guess

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,400
i've taken for granted where i live is

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,599
that

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,000
you know there's there's a lot of

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,960
corruption i actually spent um

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,520
a year in a branch of the peace corps in

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,240
manila

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,119
the philippines and during the um

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,640
typhoon

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,960
haiyan i'm not sure if you're familiar

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,079
with it uh but basically it leveled

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,079
their whole

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,800
it leveled their whole country for the

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:12,480
most part in a special especially

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,680
tacloban um and in ground zero

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,359
and they used a lot of free software and

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,520
you know that really helped unite the

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,119
people but i think colin's ready if

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,560
you're ready to

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,240
introduce him you're more than welcome

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,200
to sure

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,200
