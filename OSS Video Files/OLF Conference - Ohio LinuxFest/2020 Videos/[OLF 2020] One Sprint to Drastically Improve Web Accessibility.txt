Title: [OLF 2020] One Sprint to Drastically Improve Web Accessibility
Publication date: 2020-12-08
Playlist: 2020 Videos
Description: 
	Speaker: Robin Clower
Accessibility is generally a forgotten child of web development, but there are great reasons to make your website more accessible: more users can interact with your content, it makes life easier for all users, and itâ€™s a legal requirement as part of the ADA. It could be daunting to do an accessibility overhaul of your site, but with this talk Iâ€™ll give you a solid outline to fix many common accessibility concerns within one sprint cycle.

Iâ€™ll talk about tools you can use, from Linuxâ€™s Orca Screen Reader, to accessibility auditing browser extensions, to color contrast analyzers. I will also demonstrate common errors sites make and how to fix them quickly and effectively within the framework of Agile tickets, including full fledged Acceptance Criteria available for use by your team.

After this talk you should have confidence to get rid of a fair percentage of accessibility issues within one sprint, making life better for all users.

thank you everybody i'm so glad to be

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,880
here i'm so excited to speak at ohio

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
index fest this is actually my

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
second year last year you might have

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
seen me give a talk on

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,080
how to integrate junior developers into

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,680
your team

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,960
and that was a talk that i was excited

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
about giving because

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
i was a junior developer not too long

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
ago and

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
i was integrated all right into my team

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
and i've seen some great executions of

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,599
it and some

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,520
not so great executions of it but one

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
thing that i've also seen great and poor

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
executions of

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
are web accessibility so what i'm going

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
to go over today

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,480
is how you can quickly and drastically

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,680
improve the web accessibility

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,160
for your website in about one

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
uh sprint so what we're going to be

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,160
talking about for the agenda

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,399
is the who and why of accessibility why

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,239
is it important and what exactly is it

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
let me double check that my screen is

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,280
sharing correctly

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,400
okay we're all good there um

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
and then accessibility tools that both

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,119
the users of the platform will use and

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
as developers that you can use we're

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
also going to talk about an element by

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
element rundown of the different site

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
improvements that you could do

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
we can't get into everything that you

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,720
can do to make your site more accessible

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
but we can get into the vast majority of

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,000
things

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,119
that'll quickly make it better and then

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,960
we're going to talk about how to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
integrate this all in one sprint

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
and i'm actually going to leave you with

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,479
a trello board that you can copy and

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
paste into your own trello area or

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,840
like steal all the improvements from or

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
the acceptance criteria

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,079
and integrate them into your normal

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,960
sprint cycle so who am i well my name is

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,960
robin clower

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,479
i'm an associate consultant at work

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
state consulting we're a

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,720
columbus based firm just a little bit

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,479
north of north market but pretty much on

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,159
right next to north market

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,399
we're currently firing if you're

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,719
interested we're looking for full stat

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
full stack like net or angular

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,640
developers

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
also people who have interest in um

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,640
devops which is a role that i previously

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,200
did

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,319
but what i've primarily worked on is

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,920
front-end development

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,440
and especially drupal currently i'm a

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
maintainer for

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
about seven or eight different sites

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
mainly working on the front end

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,280
for a large broadcasting company then

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
i've also worked on some liferay

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
and during my time doing front-end and

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
back-end development i've improved

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
accessibility for two different sites

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,640
one of them was a relatively small

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,239
school in

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
upstate new york for students with

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,000
autism and then one of them

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,239
is a broadcast news or broadcast channel

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
premieres every single day and their

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
site actually was sued on account of

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
accessibility and they had to bring it

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,800
up to standards

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,959
um and so i was working on all the

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,080
different requirements to get that up

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,080
and thankfully we are like 99 of the way

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
there and we had until this year

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
the end of this year to get it done and

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,840
all we need to do is migrate video

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
players

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
all we need to do we've been working at

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
that for a while

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
so the who of accessibility i'm about to

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
show you a video it doesn't need sound

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:19,840
or anything so if you can't hear the

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,840
sound it's fine

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,319
so that is a twitch streamer he goes by

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
the name of rocky no hands

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
and as you could probably guess by the

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,360
name he's actually paralyzed from

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280
the neck down he can't move any of his

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
uh body beneath the neck

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
and so what he does is he plays video

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
games which he was really passionate

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
before getting disabled

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,480
using this controller you can see

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
actually it's pretty much a joystick

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,640
that he can control with his

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
uh head movements and it's got three

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
little pipes

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,760
and each pipe you can either blow or

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
suck at and that'll register different

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,239
inputs

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
and then you can use any combination of

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
the three pipes in order to register

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,280
different button presses so he has them

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
bound to his keyboard

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,959
or to his controller input and he has it

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,960
mapped in such a way that for instance

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
if he blows into the center hole and not

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,759
the two other holes

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
then he's able to shoot well that's the

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
most frequent action so that's the

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
easiest one for him to do

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,320
but he might also have reload bound to

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
like if you

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,120
uh pull in your breath from the left two

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
holes then it'll do something

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
so accessibility is normal people they

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,600
like to do the normal things

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
the people that need accessibility

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
options however they just need a little

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,639
different way of achieving the same

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,400
thing

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,320
so there are a whole bunch of different

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
common forms of disability and

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
we kind of have to design for all of

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,479
them because somebody with one form of

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,840
disability

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,840
might not uh be affected by other fixes

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,680
so for instance an auditory disability

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,199
like uh difficulty hearing or deafness

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,479
you would need captions on your videos

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
you wouldn't be able to hear what they

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
say

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,720
a cognitive like add or learning

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,440
disabilities they might have a harder

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
time focusing or understanding

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,360
ideas clearly so they need clearly

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,360
demarcated areas of the site like

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
obvious headers things like that to

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
guide them through the page

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
neurological diseases like parkinson's

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,560
or epilepsy they might need things like

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
no rapidly changing elements

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
so slideshows that don't flick through

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,720
the site really quickly

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,560
or uh menus that don't disappear if you

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
accidentally hover off the menu for

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
like a quarter of a second if your hand

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
shakes

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
you also have physical disabilities like

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
we saw with rocky no hands he's able to

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
play video games

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,280
with other players that was called duty

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
warzone um

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,360
with able-bodied players and he's able

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,919
to play at such a highly competitive

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,759
level

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
even though he's fully paralyzed been

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
below the neck and for websites a lot of

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,120
times that translates to

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,800
being able to navigate using keyboards

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
or different button maps instead of just

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
the mouse

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
you also have visual which is things

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,560
like blindness or

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,039
just difficulty seeing or even color

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,919
blindness so for this you need web

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,520
well labeled web elements in the html

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,080
like not necessarily things people can

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,560
see

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
but make sure that all of your tags are

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
what they're supposed to be used for

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,680
and then also good use of pictures and

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
colors

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
a disability doesn't just affect those

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,680
who have dealt with it for a long time

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,880
you can be temporarily disabled in a

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
whole bunch of different ways so you

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
could like

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
break your arm or get a concussion that

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
makes it harder to read

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,639
or focus on things harder to use a

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
screen for instance at one point

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
i actually got pink eye my my second day

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,680
of student teaching

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,639
i got pink guy over the weekend and

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,960
i had my entire room was completely dark

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
i had no lights on i even unplugged all

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
the idle lights in my room because they

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,680
were so bright

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
i had double blackout curtains on my

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,400
window i had my phone

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,360
at completely minimum darkness like as

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
dark as you could get

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
and i had downloaded a second app to

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
make it even darker

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
and the screen was still too bright for

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
me to use so i just had to sit there

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,240
doing nothing for the entire time

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,520
if i had known more about accessibility

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
options during that time

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,280
i could have actually navigated using

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,479
the voice command on my phone

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,840
and using the text to speech options on

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
my phone and i could have navigated and

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,120
still

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
been able to um peruse websites and

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
everything like that

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,759
you also have elderly people who are

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
trying to use computers and

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
just because they can't see as well

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,599
maybe you need uh ability to make your

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,240
site have larger font sizes

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,919
and then also accessibility options

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
aren't just for people who are disabled

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
it's really anybody who likes to

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
navigate the web

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,160
using a different option so for instance

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
um

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,240
navigating using keyboard but why is it

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
important

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
well it has potential to make life

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
better for everyone not just

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,879
people with disabilities like i said

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,639
when i watch youtube videos i like to

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
speed up a lot of videos really quickly

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,919
so that they're two time speed

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
i can do that with a keyboard shortcut

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,360
instead of navigating through three

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,000
menus that's an accessibility thing

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,919
but it's also something that i utilize

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
accessibility options definitely make

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
people

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,919
life better for people with disabilities

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
there are some websites that they

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,960
straight up

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,080
can't use because they don't have the

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,479
proper options

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,000
and so this will allow them to use it

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
and then also accessibility

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
is a legal requirement like i said i'm

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,599
currently working on a website

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
that was sued for the americans with

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,879
disabilities act because it's a

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,960
public-facing website

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
and title three of the ada says you

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,800
can't have discrimination on the basis

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,120
of

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
disability in public places and that has

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,839
been interpreted to mean

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,200
websites so if your website is

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,519
a place that somebody could go to

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
interact with your content or to shop

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
that's a public place that's an area

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,000
that people are trying to use

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,800
and you need to have it enabled so

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
it's not just a uh it would feel good if

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,560
we did this it's actually a legal

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,760
requirement in the u.s

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,279
so what is accessibility exactly well in

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,279
in normal in in the normal world it's uh

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,959
making traditional mediums usable for

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
people with disabilities so for instance

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,160
adding a wheelchair ramp

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,360
you can't just have a staircase or you

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,080
might have to have an elevator or

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
something

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
having elevator buttons that have

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,200
braille so that way they can read what

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,320
uh blind people can read what floor they

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
need to go to

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
closed captioning on news channels a lot

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
of times at like

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
airports and stuff it's nice that you

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
can read it from afar but you actually

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,440
really need that if you can't hear

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,080
um and then in terms of

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,519
web specifically we have the web content

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
accessibility guidelines

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
and these pretty much say what you need

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,800
to do in order to

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,320
make your website accessible for

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
pretty much anybody with a disability

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
regardless of what type of disability

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,839
they have

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,519
and there actually is no federal statute

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
that says like these are the different

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,959
requirements the federal statute for ada

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,399
basically just says

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
we need to use the web content

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,120
accessibility guidelines they're created

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
by a non-profit

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
but they're the ones that are uh

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
federally recognized as what you need to

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
adhere to

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,680
so accessibility tools for computers

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,120
well people who are disabled can use

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,399
things like keyboard navigation i've

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
talked about that a little bit

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
using tab to navigate through a website

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,240
instead of using your mouse

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,360
or shift tab to go back up there are

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,519
screen readers like

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,800
orca for linux is a global screen reader

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,760
that works for all your different

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
applications

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,399
there are also

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,120
browser-specific readers like chromevox

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,640
is a

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
extension that you wouldn't know about

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
because it ships with chrome

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,399
and you can enable it using some hotkeys

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,160
and it's just anytime you install chrome

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,800
you have the ability to turn on

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,560
your screen reader you can also set

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
different browser settings or default

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
options

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,240
so for instance you can automatically

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
make your zoom scale

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,000
150 or 200 percent for every single

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,760
website you go to

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
uh there are browser extensions that you

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
can use for

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
helping make sure that you have

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
accessibility figured out and as a

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,519
developer

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
there's something like site improve

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,839
accessibility checker that's for chrome

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
and that will do an audit of the page

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
that you're on it'll tell you all of the

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
different

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,959
areas that need improvement for

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,200
accessibility so for instance oh this

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,800
uh you've gotten a repeated id or you

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
have this other

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,959
image doesn't have the correct tags then

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
there's also color contrast analyzer and

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,160
that will tell you where your

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
colors aren't distinguished enough for

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,040
people with color blindness or

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
difficulty seeing

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,360
to be able to use your website

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
effectively

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
so now we're going to talk about some

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
common site improvements and what i'm

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
going to do is i'm going to go through a

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,079
whole bunch of different areas of

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
websites that have

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
normally some problems with

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,920
accessibility and then i'm going to

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
frame it in terms of

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
at the end how you can fix that all in

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,880
one sprint

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,480
so before we get too far into it i want

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
to do a little exercise

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,360
so if you'll please go to you can

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,959
minimize the screen i'll talk out loud

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,560
i'll read the instructions out loud go

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,240
to bbc.com on your favorite web browser

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,079
and then click on the first news article

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,440
that doesn't have to do with the

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,200
us election

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
and don't click anything else after you

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,079
click on that article

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,000
okay go ahead and now click tab

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
once and look in the top left hand

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
corner of your screen you should see a

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,480
little box

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,440
up here around the bbc logo

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
and click tab one more time a little

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
button should have just appeared that

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,920
says something like skip to main content

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,800
and that button it wasn't there before

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,000
but now it's there

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,600
go ahead and click enter once

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
so your screen should have shifted down

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
a little bit and now you should be like

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
maybe on the

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,519
the first hyperlink in the article so

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,639
maybe like the author's name or

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,279
something like that alright go ahead

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,839
and refresh the page and don't click

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,839
anything again

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
now click tab and instead of hitting

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,959
enter when you get to that button

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
just keep on hitting tab until you reach

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
the same place that you

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,920
reached a niche originally so just keep

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,120
on hitting tab until you reach that

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
author's name hyperlink

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,240
okay so that probably took you like like

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
it took probably around three or four

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,880
button presses

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,399
or in order to do it originally and now

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,560
it took you like 20 to get through

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,160
just because there are so many menus so

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
that's the power of good accessibility

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
that you honestly wouldn't know about

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
if you've never seen that feature before

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,760
and you can come back to the slideshow

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
now

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
and somebody in slackchat said there are

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,199
some video players that like

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,800
automatically hide the volume when you

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,720
mouse over it or things like that

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,560
and yeah features like that they're

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,440
annoying for people without disabilities

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,160
to use and they're absolutely

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,519
infuriating and or unusable for people

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
with disabilities

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
so in tabbing the general principles are

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
you only want your interactable items to

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,399
be tabable you don't want to have to tab

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,639
through like

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
every single thing on your site

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
especially there are some like ads that

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,279
get in there

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,440
and abs have like 50 billion different

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,880
elements wrapped up in one iframe and if

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
you had to tab through every single one

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
of those it would be horrible

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
so generally links are automatically

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,399
tappable menus

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,079
are automatically tabulable but divs

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,560
headers

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
paragraphs are not typical keyboard

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,959
navigation should progress

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
logically across and down the page so if

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
you start in the top left corner

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
then you're going to go all the way

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,279
across to the right-hand side and then

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,199
go down and you're going to go

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
like a normal reading order if your

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,160
stuff skips all over the page

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,399
then that's going to be really hard to

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,839
follow where your cursor is if you don't

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
use a mouse um the a common area that i

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
see this

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
is people have their logo in the top

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,399
left-hand corner and then like their

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,839
social items

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,839
in the top right hand corner and there's

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,000
a menu between them and it'll skip from

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,959
the local to the social menu

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,360
to the regular menu that's a no-go it

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,440
should go from left to right

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,959
another thing that should not happen

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
menus should not open

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,440
if you click tab over top of the menu so

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
when you were tabbing through the bbc

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
but there was like a more menu with like

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
a little down thing but you didn't have

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,160
to tab through the entire sub menu and

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,800
that's really important because some

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
sites

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,639
especially like university sites and

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
stuff like that have like 50 billion

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
submenus that are just completely

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,720
impossible

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,399
if you had to tab through each one of

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
those every single time that you wanted

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,320
to visit a page on the site

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
hyperlinks shouldn't be repeated and

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,399
what i mean by that is if you have two

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
links

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,560
leading to the same place and they're

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
close to the same place on the page

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
then only one of those should be table

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
so for instance this is a common feature

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
a card

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,240
on a lot of sites normally you would be

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,920
able to tap on the image with your mouse

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,880
and that would take you to the article

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,680
or you could tap

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,279
the headline normally the paragraph you

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,160
probably wouldn't be able to link to the

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
article from

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
and then this culture thing is a

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,920
separate uh link and that'll lead you to

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
like their culture

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
page so if you're clicking with a mouse

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,920
it's fine you want to be able to click

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,120
on all of this area and have it go

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,120
if you're tabbing through you don't want

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,839
to have to tap through like 30 cards in

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,800
a row

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
where it highlights this image and then

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,880
it highlights

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,480
this text and then it highlights here if

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,199
you could remove one of those that's

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
ideal

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,399
so one way of doing it is to have this

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,040
entire card be tabbable

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,639
and remove the link here another way of

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
doing it is have this first one be

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
tabbable

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
and then remove the ability to tab to

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
this one

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,440
so another thing that you need is

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,800
invisible items should not be tappable

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,560
and this is a problem especially with

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
carousels a lot of the time

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,839
is you'll have three items on screen

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,079
that you can see

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
and then like seven items off the screen

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,040
and you actually tab

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
you tab through the first three items

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,440
and then actually tabs through the

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
remaining seven

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,800
items and you can't actually tell where

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,320
your cursor is because they're

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
completely off the screen

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
or modals are another area where this

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,600
faces problems you have like a hyperlink

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,319
for like a newsletter sign

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,959
up or something in your modal and you

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,400
try and

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
tab around and then all of a sudden your

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
cursor just completely disappears

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
it's because it went to this hidden

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,240
mobile that's not even visible to

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919
the eye so make sure all of that's not

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
tabiable and then use javascript to

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,480
enable the tabbing when it's there

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,559
and then also like we saw in bbc bbc

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,079
pages should have a skip to main content

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,240
item at the top of the page

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,000
that'll skip past like all the layers of

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,520
menus because most pages obviously

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,039
have a ton of menus so here are a couple

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
html properties that you'll need to

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,840
shore up on if you want to make your

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,600
tabbing accessible

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,000
there's something called tab index and

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,840
that can be set to negative one or zero

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
if the item should be tabable it could

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,960
be zero um

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,880
for it's set as a default like tab index

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
is automatically zero and it's not even

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,520
there for a tags

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,440
but if you want to change that then you

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,600
need to add tab index equals

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
negative one or zero so for instance

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
like i talked about with the carousel

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
earlier

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
you would want to have all of those

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,400
items that are off screen have a tab

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
index of minus one

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
and then when you hit the next button on

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,799
the carousel or you swipe to the right

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
on the carousel and those new ones

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
appear

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,520
the old ones should get a tab index of

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
zero and then new ones

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
are of negative one and the new ones

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,039
should get a tab

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
index of zero so that way you can tab to

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,240
them

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,880
aria hidden tells whether or not and

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,120
these aria labels are something used in

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,960
accessibility they basically tell screen

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,679
reader additional information that might

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
not

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,160
be obvious so arya hidden tells is an

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,360
item hidden

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,039
um so we have like the

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,440
tab index set to negative one on the

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,360
carousel and we're also going to hide

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
aria hidden equals true

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
that item from the carousel so that way

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,480
your screener doesn't try and pick up on

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,559
that information

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,160
another one is arya has pop-up and

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,440
that'll tell you especially with menus

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,919
like does this menu have a sub menu

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,200
and aria expanded if it has a sub menu

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,880
then is it expanded

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
so for instance if i'm using a screen

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,280
reader and i go to this site it might

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
say a list with four items

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
third item healthy living button

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,400
collapsed

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,760
and so what's that telling me is okay

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,160
i'm on the third of four

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
items in this menu it's called healthy

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
living and it's a button

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
but it is collapsed which means that

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
there's stuff that can expand out from

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
it

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
and so if i click down and expand it it

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,480
says list with four items third item

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
healthy living

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,520
button expanded so now we know there was

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,280
a state change

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,280
and it is now an expanded item

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,000
so we want to make sure that our menus

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,640
are logical

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,280
so we've got a demo menu here it's got

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
an about

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,200
admissions at an academics page and then

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,720
this menu has some sub menus

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,880
so remember earlier when i said you want

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,320
to make sure that only the top level

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
menu items are

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
naturally table because you don't want

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
to have to tab through a whole bunch of

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
sub menus

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
you can see what they're doing here is

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,120
they have their a tag is a menu item

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
it has a pop-up we know that it should

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,720
expand

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,919
aria expanded should be set to true i

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
took the screenshot at a slightly

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,039
different time

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,039
because it is currently expanded and the

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,440
tab index is zero because we want to be

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,000
able to tab to this top level menu item

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
however the menu beneath it like

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
overview

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,640
it should have a tab index of negative

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
one because we don't want it to be

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
tappable

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
and then it also doesn't need to have

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,520
anything like arya has popup or arya

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,159
expanded

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,400
because it's not uh it doesn't have sub

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,120
menus but you can see the facts

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
should have aria has pop-up true aria

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
expanded false

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
because it has a submenu that's not

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,640
currently expanded

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,120
and so these are the type of things that

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,600
we'll need to change to map

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,360
dynamically with javascript so if you

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,600
like hover over the menu item

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,880
then all of a sudden it should change

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,440
those different tabbing

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
indexes and aria has pop-up already

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,360
expanded etc

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
so that way the users are told about the

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,280
state change and it shouldn't just be

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,760
for hovers it should also be for focus

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
if that item receives focus then we're

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,080
gonna change those

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,679
uh bonus tip fly out menus like this if

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,000
you hover over them they should have a

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
slight delay before collapsing

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
so i think we've all probably done

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,520
something where you hover

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,280
over a site and then you try and go down

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,880
to the next part of the menu and it like

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,320
disappears on you on accident because

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
maybe you moused out of it for a little

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
bit

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,159
maybe it like didn't stick around if

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,760
there's an ever so slight delay

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
it doesn't look quite as great but it

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,600
means somebody who has like a shaky hand

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,440
like parkinson's or something

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,880
the menu doesn't disappear on them when

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,159
they accidentally

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,159
swipe out from the menu

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
okay so next up we're going to talk

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,760
about headings

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,080
so there should only be one h1 tag per

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,320
page

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
and there should be exactly one h1 tag

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,120
per page

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,480
so this is really easy on most sites if

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
you have like an article

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,400
the article title should be the h1

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,320
heading it's a little bit harder on the

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,600
home page of some sites like

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
on a news site or something you have a

00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
whole bunch of different articles all

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,840
there

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,159
maybe you just make the very first like

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,000
uh presidential election results

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
that should be your h1 and then all of

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,400
the other ones will not be

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,480
an h1 now here's an example from bbc

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
and a lot of my examples are from bbc

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,039
just uh

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
i haven't worked for them or anything i

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
just chose them because i needed

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
an example and i figured it's a

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,039
relatively neutral news site so

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,080
i wouldn't catch any flack during this

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,200
election season

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,760
so this area right here is made up of

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,360
it's pretty typical we've got a card

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,960
it's like a card large or something and

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,360
then a couple cards smalls

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,480
so in your mind think about for a second

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
what are all of the

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,919
headers that you see in this area and

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,760
try and pick out

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,760
how all of the headers you can think of

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,120
okay and so now think about with what

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,679
you know about headers which ones are

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,159
either

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:01,760
like h2s which ones are your h3s which

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,760
ones are your h4s etc

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,320
okay i just revealed them this top one

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,480
even though it's smaller than this next

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,320
one is actually an h2

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
this one even though it's larger than

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,440
all of these is actually an h3 and if

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,760
you expect to

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,960
inspect the bbc you'll actually see that

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,440
and that's because headers should

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,080
progress

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,919
logically through a page so h2s should

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,039
be nested under h1s

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,559
h3s should be nested under h2s i know

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,000
when i started development

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,000
i always wanted to use the one that

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,159
closest matched what was

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
the styling we were looking for so like

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,880
in this i probably would have said this

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,600
is an h2

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,559
this is an h3 then these are h4s or

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,559
something

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,720
no it should progress logically and then

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,760
you use styling in order to change all

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,760
those elements

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,000
so this one even though it's the exact

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,000
same as these it's in h3

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,320
it's styled slightly differently but

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,520
what this tells screen readers and

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,279
navigation is that this is the next most

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,400
important thing it's a

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,200
this is a sub menu or a section and all

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,200
of these are sub areas of that section

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,400
i'm getting quite a few slack things so

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,440
i'm just going to double check that

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,440
everything's still working well

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,440
okay we're all good okay and then

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
assistive text readers are able to skip

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,520
based on this and they'll tell you like

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,919
header three the cell that's a save 10

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,039
million lives and you know okay that

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,039
it makes sense logically

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,159
next up we're going to talk about colors

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
there's a popular game right now you

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,919
might have heard of it it's called among

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,640
us

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,000
and the characters among us are denoted

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,480
mainly by their color

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
uh it's a social deduction game kind of

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,200
like mafia if you haven't heard of it

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
um where there are a couple imposters

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,159
among the crewmates and the crewmates

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,120
are trying to solve things

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,440
but generally you have a a period after

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,039
you

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,799
see a dead body that you're trying to

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,520
figure out who the person was that

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
killed them

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,240
and in among us a lot of times you say

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,440
the person's color like oh i saw

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
red kill the person well that's all well

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
and good

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,400
if you do not have color blindness but

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,279
this red definitely doesn't look red

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,880
to somebody with uh this color blindness

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,799
for instance it looks gray it looks the

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,000
exact same as this color and this color

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,000
and this color

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,679
so you're just not going to be able to

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,080
play the game pretty much unless you

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,720
have

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
very specific character names of the

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
people playing

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
and this is important because eight

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,559
percent of men are colorblind for some

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
reason there's actually a pretty big gap

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,760
it's like

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
uh 0.5 percent of women are colored

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,080
blind and eight percent of men

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,520
and so you need to make sure that your

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,960
website is designed for people who have

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,320
color blindness

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
a good way of doing that is making sure

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,279
that colors should have a contrast of

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,960
three or greater and what that means is

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,200
there are websites like this that's what

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,360
the hyperlink leads to

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
it will tell you how contrasting the

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,000
colors are

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,760
if one of them is in the foreground and

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,279
one of them is in the background

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,440
so for instance this is 3.2 it's uh

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,960
the minimum requirement is three the

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,120
ideal requirement is four

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,200
and you can see it's very clear reading

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,240
right here that how to use

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,279
it's it's pretty easy still reading this

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,039
area

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,760
but there are some sites that i've seen

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,520
that just use like a light yellow

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
background and then white text or

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,159
something i just i can't read that text

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,679
and i

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,320
don't have any difficulties with my

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,480
vision another thing that's important is

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,840
links can't just use color so you notice

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
this link right here

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,679
has both a color difference and it has

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,039
an underline that's really important

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
because somebody who

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,279
is colorblind might not be able to tell

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
that the link is any different color

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,640
and so they're just going around they're

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,159
like oh i wish this article had some

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,840
hyperlinks and it's like well the

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440
article does have a ton of hyperlinks

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,760
you just can't read them

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,679
and you can style it pretty cool you can

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,919
have cool underlines and a lot of stuff

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,880
or you could even make it like bold or

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,960
wikipedia obviously has the normal like

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
annotation thing those are different

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
ways that you can indicate that there is

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
a link there

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,919
and then also forms shouldn't just use

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
color for intro

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,559
info so if you got rid of this this is a

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,640
required question right here

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,039
i failed this form and i got a red

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
outline here and then a red underline

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,960
but if you don't have the ability to

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,360
pick out red or red looks like green to

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,559
you

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,399
then it looks like this was a

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,360
successfully submitted question if you

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
don't have the

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
this is a required question element so

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,799
make sure your forms don't just use

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,799
color for info

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,960
the next thing we're going to talk about

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,080
is images this is my

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
adorable little puppy bernie and

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,840
if you look at them for a while and

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,360
think about it what's the difference

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,840
between these two images

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,840
what do you see that's different here

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,679
so there's actually no visual difference

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,760
in the images

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,159
the only difference is if this was on a

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,480
website the one on the left has an alt

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,720
tag that says adorable fluffy dog sleeps

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,919
so if you're using a voice a

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,840
text-to-speech reader

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,000
and you're panning through and it says

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,440
image

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
and then you go to the next thing and it

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,480
continues on then that means that image

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,480
didn't have

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,919
an alt tag and so the person would never

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
know that they just looked at an image

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,039
of an adorable

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,320
fluffy dog sleeping instead they would

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,559
just hear it's an image and they would

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,120
be completely lost as to what that image

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,480
was

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
this is especially important on like

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,399
blogs and stuff you have an image of

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,080
maybe the beautiful

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
meal that you cooked and talking about

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,600
cooking this meal and you don't describe

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,720
what's happening in each step of the

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,919
image so like

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,080
oh i um saute the onions

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,120
and then you have a picture of like the

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,720
onion sauteing

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,159
but instead of using oil you're using

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,840
butter and that's very obvious in the

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,600
image but then you don't say that

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,320
some people might try and use one

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,720
instead of the other for instance

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,080
now you can have images with alt tags

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,760
that are blank

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,600
however that should be only used for

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,919
images that are completely decorative

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,120
so let's say you have like a flower off

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,760
in the corner of your

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,279
um your website that just floats around

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,559
with you and it doesn't matter at all

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,640
then that can have an image of all

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,840
tagged nothing but that should only be

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
used for decorative images

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,279
next up images screen readers can't

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,840
understand images without alt text like

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,080
we said

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,399
but they also can't parse words inside

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
of images so for instance memes with its

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,880
big

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
impact font if you're blind you can't

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,520
read that font so you need to have the

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,159
alt tag that would say

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,360
this image says such and such it's the

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,880
the normal meme

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,039
and it says this thing or alternatively

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,120
you can use your normal html elements

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,240
and overlay them over top the image and

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
that's the better option if you're

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,399
developing a

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,520
website so for instance on here again

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,559
from the bbc

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,840
we have a header and a paragraph and

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,880
then their kickr

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,799
all of them are overlapping the white

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
background of the penguins but you'll

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,320
notice there's actually like a gradient

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,640
that goes from the bottom of the

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,600
text about halfway up the screen of the

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,799
body in the image

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,399
and even though the science and

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,159
environment is like a pretty light grey

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
text and is pretty much the exact same

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,360
color of the snow as the background

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,039
it's still very clearly readable so this

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
is a great way of making sure that your

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,039
images

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
people can people using screen readers

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,720
can

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,799
understand everything that's happening

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,799
on the page and not have it distracting

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,279
a couple other random things that i want

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,799
to talk about

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,480
what is the difference between these

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,120
three buttons

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,640
now they're all styled with a basic

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,480
bootstrap styling they're all called

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,200
button button primary or whatever

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,200
button default

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,840
so the first one is a button and it is a

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,320
close button

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,919
the second one is a link that takes us

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,240
back a page or something like that and

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,720
the third one is a submit button

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,760
so they all have very different features

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
and different

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,440
reasons to use each one and if you

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,240
confuse them a lot of times like oh i

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,919
have a link

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,840
that i want to look like a button i'll

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,760
use a button instead

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,360
there's a there's a distinct reason and

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,519
it's because of accessibility

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
buttons are for actions so something

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,559
like a

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
x to exit out of a modal should be a

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,919
button that's a

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,880
action you're closing that modal or like

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,080
on a carousel

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,159
the next item should be a button a's

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
are for links so even if it's styled the

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
exact same way

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
if you have a link that's leading

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,120
somewhere it should always be an a tag

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,240
and then inputs are for your forms so

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,679
input type submit

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
you don't want to be submitting a form

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,399
with a button because somebody might be

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,600
expecting

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,840
something else like that to happen

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,840
focus and hover are pretty much

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,720
synonymous and should be made synonymous

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,919
in all your css and javascript

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,559
so like i said earlier if you're

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,519
hovering over a menu item you also want

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,360
to make the same thing if you're

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,559
focusing on that menu item you want to

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,240
expand it as well

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,840
somebody using the keyboard isn't

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,039
necessarily going to hover over all the

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,640
elements instead they're going to be

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,760
tabbing through all the elements

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,760
and so you need to have the same

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,240
behavior for both

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,240
all ids on your page should be unique

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,519
ids you shouldn't have any duplicated

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
ids on your page

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,120
this helps people navigate the website

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,760
it also helps

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,360
with your labeled attributes like you

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,279
might have a form item

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,799
and the label is labeling it and it's

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,240
labeling this unique id

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,080
element of the form so if we're talking

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,720
in terms of fixing everything in one

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,279
sprint

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,880
carousels in general are a nightmare for

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,279
accessibility and they're really hard to

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
do

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,960
they're out of scope for the sprint i

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
would say probably like half the work i

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,559
did for the website that i was improving

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,960
um that had been sued was for

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,039
the carousel that we were using and then

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,159
also videos are hard and not a scope for

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,600
the sprint so

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,519
videos you're probably not going to be

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,760
able to make accessible short

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
of completely revamping your video

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,240
system and swapping to a new video

00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,679
system now there are some that are

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,360
already utilizing

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,960
accessibility features so if you can use

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,640
for instance a youtube embed

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,279
instead of your own proprietary video

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,760
software then that'll allow you to

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,279
have an accessible video on your site

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,080
which is probably a better option for a

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,799
small team

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,159
but if you're a site that's based on ad

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,840
revenue and everything like that

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,840
then honestly you need to have a frank

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,919
discussion with your product owners or

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,080
whoever's in charge of your site to get

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
a video system that is accessible

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
because like i said it is something you

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,039
can be sued for

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,600
this is a instance of the css you've got

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,320
your a

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,600
hover and your a focus should all have

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,360
the exact same things

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
every time you have hover have focus

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,200
right next to it for both javascript and

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,120
css

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,640
so putting it all together i made you

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,880
all a trello board

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,720
and so what you should do if you're

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
actually wanting to follow through

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,000
i hate those texts inside images veins i

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,360
have to copy type them for blind

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,360
friends yeah exactly

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,080
there's the standard um

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,679
there are some questions that have

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,880
popped up open standard for building uis

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,600
for accessibility

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,960
there the wcag standard is the one that

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,800
you want to follow and they have pretty

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
informative links

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
and a lot of them are actually linked in

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:20,159
the trello board so

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:22,480
here is my trello board

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,079
i'll address that in a second so for

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,639
instance we've got our forms

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,480
and here's the w3 they're the people who

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,159
actually make the guidelines

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
um and they tell you all of the

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,720
different elements that you should have

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,720
with forms

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,480
so labeling controls you need to have

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,159
your form with controls labeled uh you

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,960
should have multi-page forms instead of

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,320
all of your

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,359
stuff being on one huge long form

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,440
so this trello board has two elements

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,800
first you can duplicate this board and

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,359
if you're logged into trello

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
there will be like a show menu over here

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,399
and then there will be like a duplicate

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,879
this board you can copy duplicate the

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,399
board

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,320
or you can just copy and paste all the

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,920
different elements

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,880
then what you're going to have to do as

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,720
the person who is interested in this or

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,480
you'll have to assign somebody to this

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,040
do a spike and audit all the different

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,720
elements

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,079
that you'll need to fix in the to-do

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,440
column so

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,880
there are some elements that on your

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
site you're already going to be good for

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
you've already finished

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,599
there are other elements that you didn't

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
know were a thing and now you learned

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,079
and so you're going to have to go

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,920
through and manually figure out all the

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,480
different problems on your site

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,400
the good thing is that you're going to

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,640
be able to use some tools

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,560
to use this so i talked earlier about

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,599
some of the chrome tools that you have

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,000
one of them is something called uh

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,880
site accessibility checker so i'm gonna

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,640
go on to

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,079
skinnytaste.com it's not a site i've

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,760
worked on it's just a

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,440
site that i get a lot of my web my

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,280
recipes from each week

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
and they're actually they're my example

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,920
because for the most part they've got

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,440
really good accessibility

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,359
if you're on their mobile site they have

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,320
a little pop-up that has accessibility

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
options

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
but we're going to do a little audit of

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,119
their page so i'm going to click this

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,560
and it's going to show up all of the

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,760
different areas on the site

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,000
that aren't quite great so

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,040
you can see it shows up things like use

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,359
of color

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,160
link is identified only by color let's

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,160
see where that is

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,599
it's just like find out more so if i

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,280
look on here

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,960
i think it's one of these elements up

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,119
here you can see this like via email

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,119
that's a link but it only distinguishes

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,160
itself via color

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,599
or um enough time

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,440
it's making sure that there's enough

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,280
time before you navigate through the

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,640
different sites

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,240
there are some other elements that you

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,760
might have and again like i said this

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,240
site is pretty good for accessibility so

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,040
there's not a lot that's on here

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,320
images of text so we talked about is the

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,160
image free of text

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
and these areas right here this is a

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,839
pretty big flaw on her site

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,119
we've got skinny taste meal prep it's a

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,480
book it's a link

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,160
but it doesn't have any way of

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,000
distinguishing what this book is

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,160
to somebody using a screen reader so it

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,920
just says order now on amazon but what

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,520
am i ordering am i ordering her air

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,480
fryer book or one and done book

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,000
am i ordering like an actual air fryer

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,720
she should have some sort of text that

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,240
tells what these things are

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,680
and i get she does good for the most

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
part and i'm just using this as a little

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,520
example

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
another tool that i really like is a

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,760
color contrast analyzer so i'm going to

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,599
pull that up right now

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,119
so i'm going to capture just a little

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,359
bit and we're going to look at this

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,200
region right here so she distinguishes

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,680
all of her recipes using these little

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,720
uh elements and it says whether or not

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
the recipe

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,400
is like paleo or if it's vegan or things

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,920
like that

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
but you can see some of them are pretty

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,839
hard to read this paleo there's like a

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,040
little pea inside of that yellow

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,960
honestly this is

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,320
pretty hard to read for me some of them

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,839
are great this pressure cooker i think

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,359
it's great it looks

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,280
uh exactly right let's see

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,040
i'm pretty zoomed in so that's probably

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,160
causing a problem

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,119
let me kill this and then

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,119
color contrast

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,359
okay so i don't know why it's offset but

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
you're able to see it did it like a

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,720
little mask

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,520
so for the minimum requirements we can

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,880
scan it

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,480
and it'll show all of the elements

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,839
obviously we've got our text is

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,880
perfectly readable

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,480
but we can only see the pc

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,440
and the k for keto and pressure cooker

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,880
we can't tell what the kf is or the fm

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,800
and we can hide the mask and look at

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
those like the gf the gluten free it's

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,960
this lightish pink and a white

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,560
background

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,079
you can't actually distinguish what that

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,920
is if you have difficulty

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,000
with colors or even sometimes if you

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,760
don't so as a developer one of my

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,280
favorite sites is this contrast ratio

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
and it's the one that i showed earlier

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,480
and you type in two colors and it'll

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,880
tell you what the ratio is

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,960
so this 2.7 that's not accessible it's

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,720
like especially really hard reading this

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,480
and i have to highlight it in order to

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,680
read it well some of the other things

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,920
that she has on this

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,760
like one of the yellows that she uses

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,440
that's even more difficult like i

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
i straight up can't read anything aside

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,320
from how to use without some serious eye

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,960
strain

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
or the red that she uses elsewhere

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,599
against the white

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
okay that's actually pretty good we can

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,280
actually read that and if we look at the

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,359
site

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,560
that's that q okay that q is pretty

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,880
visible

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,720
um so this will be an easy way of

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,359
checking and you can also change

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,800
like what happens if i use black font

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,160
okay that's pretty

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,000
pretty understandable and pretty

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,200
readable especially if i use it against

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,880
the yellow background

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,599
so what i recommend their web designer

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
does is about half of these logos can be

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,240
like they are the keto the pressure

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,760
cooker the kid friendly

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,920
but then the others i would recommend

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,880
changing to a really dark gray font or

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,800
something like that

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,320
and it won't look too out of place i've

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,680
done it for some other sites

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,320
but it'll actually um it'll make sure

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,599
that all of this is readable

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,520
so on this trello board um there are

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,480
also some things like the headers that

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
talk about

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,680
you should have exactly one hp one tag

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,240
you should have the h2s nested under h3s

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,760
the styling can be used to replicate and

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,400
so you can copy all of these different

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,079
elements

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,920
now i saw a question come in earlier

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,640
that i want to bring attention to and

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,400
it's pretty much

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,400
how can i convince somebody from a

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,160
business owner that this is a good idea

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,839
to improve their site this way

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,839
and that's the beauty of this talk you

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,800
don't even necessarily have to have

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,319
one uh sprint dedicated to it because

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
you can actually use all of these

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,960
different elements and bring them into

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,720
your existing sprint

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,480
and just do like one or two kind of

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,160
sneaky points at a time

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,839
you don't necessarily need to have all

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
of the different things done exactly on

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,079
one sprint although that would be pretty

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,680
ideal

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,359
instead you could just say like okay

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,440
this week we're fixing all of our links

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,680
and we're making sure the link styling

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,200
is consistent across the page all of the

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,480
links have the different elements

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,160
and we're just going to do that it's

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,599
going to be like two or three points

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,960
it's not going to really add that much

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,960
to our sprint commit

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
and it should be something that we can

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
knock out and if you do this really

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,119
incremental thing

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,720
instead of just saying hey we need to

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,200
take a full sprint to get all of this

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
done

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,720
you say hey we're just going to do a

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,440
little bit of work on here then that'll

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,400
help

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
make it much easier

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,800
yeah so um bariga comments that they

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,760
don't know the last time they saw

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,400
qa talk about testing headphones or

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,839
anything

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,599
we didn't either when we were designing

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,440
site and the site that i had to improve

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,119
was actually a site that i helped make

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,880
and we didn't have our qa doing anything

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,359
like that and now i'm getting tickets

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,359
like

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,880
oh if you're using the text-to-speech on

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,800
your android device

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,040
and you navigate to this very specific

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,160
area it's not reading out loud

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,800
i actually had to like install a mac vm

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,240
on my ubuntu machine in order to test

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,880
the things out on the safari that they

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,800
said because i don't own a mac um

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
these are things that until you're sued

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,599
you probably wouldn't know about you

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,480
probably wouldn't recognize that it's a

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,960
problem

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,319
once your suit is like man our site is

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,920
really quite horrendous

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,359
and one thing that i would recommend you

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,079
do is just try

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,440
out different um especially

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,960
text-to-speech things

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,359
on your phone it's a default setting

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,680
that you have in both

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,359
iphones and androids you can turn it on

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,480
from your accessibility options in your

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,560
phone settings

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
and try and experiment what it's like to

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
use your phone with accessibility and

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,079
what elements have

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,599
uh are easy for you to use and what

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,280
elements are hard for you to use

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,200
and if you try out the more of these

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,680
tools like i said orca

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,319
for um linux is something it's just

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,480
pseudo app

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,599
install work uh if you use it then it'll

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,079
tell you all the things that are

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,040
happening

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,599
on your deviant-based system um like for

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,920
instance

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,880
the second i turn it on it says where in

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,440
the terminal window

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,720
orca was just enabled and it'll tell me

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,079
like a brief description about

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
everything that's happened on the screen

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,400
and if i

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,920
uh swap between screens it'll tell me

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,480
everything that happened on the screen

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
so

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,680
slack message somebody just joined

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,520
general

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,480
um let's see some of this other thing

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,680
yeah so accessibility is a lot of times

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,040
like i said it's something that's

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,160
relatively forgotten about

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,240
but it's something that if you build

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,319
your site around from the very beginning

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
then it's going to be really easy if all

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,040
of your links have good color contrast

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,800
at the beginning

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,440
and you're setting all your default sas

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,760
files to have this color for link text

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,520
then that's great if you need to do an

00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,760
audit halfway through building a site to

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,000
make sure things are accessible

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,800
that then you need to do that and

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,480
especially

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,160
the extra time that you can do to figure

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,000
out which carousels are accessible or

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,440
which video players are accessible

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,960
then that's really important because if

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,560
you custom build a carousel or if you

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
use a carousel library that's out of

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,319
date

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,359
not accessible then

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,920
and then that's going to cause you

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,599
problems later down the line

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,680
let's see harvest is a good texas speech

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,359
for linux but semi-assembly

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,040
yeah i don't really i don't really love

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,160
the orca default voice

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,440
and what i really like is um chromevox's

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,440
voice is pretty clear

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,319
but obviously that's only usable for

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,160
chrome specifically

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,520
let's see some other questions if you

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,240
have any questions feel free to throw

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,119
them out that

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,480
is actually pretty much the um the

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
majority of what i was going to talk

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,040
about

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,040
but i'm more than happy any questions

00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,800
that you have about accessibility

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,520
or what i've done or anything like that

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,720
then

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,440
let me know it's good to have an

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,960
accessibility seminar at linuxfest

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,520
yeah windows license yeah and it's

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,280
really nice

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,960
when i started using orca it's not the

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,000
greatest text-to-speech reader

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,359
but it was so quick and easy to install

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,800
if you're used to the linux operating

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,839
system it was just like i said an app to

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,599
apt-install

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,440
that we're we're so used to doing these

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,839
type of things that it's second nature i

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,599
tried installing the windows equivalent

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,200
and it took me quite a while to get

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
through and especially if you're

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,880
booting up an operating system for the

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,880
very first time and you already have

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,440
difficulty with uh site or anything like

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,400
that

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,240
figuring out how to make the

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,560
text-to-speech work is the last thing

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,160
that you want to be navigating

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,319
blind literally um thanks so much robin

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,960
uh the trello board is super cool

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,599
thanks for creating that for us um it

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,839
was a

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,640
question in the zoom q a and thank you

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,079
carl uh

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,800
miller for using the zoom q a that's

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,839
really

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,720
where we like her questions asked so if

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,480
you don't mind

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,400
answering that in slack i'm sure carl

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,520
was would appreciate it

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,240
this question is do you know of any good

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,560
wordpress

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
themes that implement the suggestions in

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,720
your presentation

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,280
so i with that said i i wanted to be

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
sure to

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,839
acknowledge carl but we need to be

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,560
sensitive to time in the program as well

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,119
so

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,760
thanks again robin i i appreciate you

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,000
for us

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,240
speaking with us so i haven't worked

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,880
with wordpress specifically i'm sure if

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,040
you

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,400
search wordpress accessibility then

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,560
there probably are going to be some

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,720
wordpress themes that you can use

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,800
but i i don't know any specifically off

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,359
the top of my head

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,960
if anybody in chat has feedback or

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,160
wordpress suggestions that they've used

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,000
in the past i'd be more than glad to

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,599
hear them

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,760
i also see some people talking about

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,880
accessibility in video games and that's

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,480
one of the things that

00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,640
got me excited about it um there's a

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,920
series of youtube videos by a guy named

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,920
game maker's toolkit

00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,359
where he talks about accessibility in

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
popular video games that have been

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,760
happening

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,599
um and the push for accessibility

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,599
options in video games has been

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,640
made pretty pretty strong in the past

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,280
couple years and some of the

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,119
games that are really great for it um

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,880
last of us i see mentioned

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,319
that has like completely customizable

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,880
difficulty options so

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,920
maybe some of the enemies are easier to

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,319
kill than they would be

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,680
by default but the puzzles that you're

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,160
experimenting with are going to be

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,839
harder

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,280
because you can do the slow puzzles but

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,839
you can't do the uh

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,359
shooty looty stuff or a game that i

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,280
played a lot of was celeste

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,520
and that's a platformer game and it

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,200
allows you to

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,960
change the options like you can have

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,440
multiple of the

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,800
the fast movement mechanic uh before

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,560
touching the ground instead of just

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,640
one or you can turn off like dangerous

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,520
spikes uh to where you can land on them

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,040
and not be hurt

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,359
and i actually had to do that to beat

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,119
the final the most final level

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,800
it's like a five minute long screen but

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,319
i was like i can't beat this the regular

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,760
way i'm just going to turn this on so

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,160
that i can see the true ending of the

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
game

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,200
it's something that was useful for me as

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,359
an able-bodied player

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,960
but it's especially useful for somebody

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,920
who has problems with

00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,480
um accessibility i know in among us

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,400
specifically

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
it's a game i mentioned earlier they are

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,119
working on making some sorry not to be

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,160
rude uh we we're two minutes past time

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,000
oh yeah okay

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,400
please continue the conversation in

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,640
slack thanks okay thank you

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,839
for joining us locally but virtually in

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,240
columbus ohio

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,240
have a great one robin thank you thanks

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,240
