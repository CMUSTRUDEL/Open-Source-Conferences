	Speaker: Robin Clower
Accessibility is generally a forgotten child of web development, but there are great reasons to make your website more accessible: more users can interact with your content, it makes life easier for all users, and it’s a legal requirement as part of the ADA. It could be daunting to do an accessibility overhaul of your site, but with this talk I’ll give you a solid outline to fix many common accessibility concerns within one sprint cycle.

I’ll talk about tools you can use, from Linux’s Orca Screen Reader, to accessibility auditing browser extensions, to color contrast analyzers. I will also demonstrate common errors sites make and how to fix them quickly and effectively within the framework of Agile tickets, including full fledged Acceptance Criteria available for use by your team.

After this talk you should have confidence to get rid of a fair percentage of accessibility issues within one sprint, making life better for all users.
