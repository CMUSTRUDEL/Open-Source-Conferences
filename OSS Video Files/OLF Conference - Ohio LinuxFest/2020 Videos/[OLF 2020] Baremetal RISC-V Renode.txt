Description: 
	Speaker: Zak Kohler
Explore the line between hardware and software by writing code with absolute control over the cpu and peripherals. We’ll explore how to do this using a completely free and open source simulator (Renode), toolchain (GCC), and instruction set (RISC-V). Using assembly, we’ll initialize parts of the system such as CPU interrupts and privilege levels, and setting up a call stack so we can use C. Using C we’ll build a handler for serial IO. Finally we’ll talk about the next steps in building a toy operating system such as building a simple monitor menu, memory management, and multitasking.
