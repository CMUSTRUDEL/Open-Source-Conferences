my travel has been colliding with the

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,240
linux fest so actually after this I'm

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,979

proponent proponent of community run

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,130
shows right because yeah it's really

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,420
cool that there's vendors and money and

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,670
all that kind of stuff and that's really

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,290

us by us right and that's really awesome

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,009
that's why i really enjoy ohio linux

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,820
fest and conferences like scale and

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,049
whatnot so Who am I like you're like

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,090

no bacon like I get it I get it that's

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,780
cool um I've been using Linux since

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,070
nineteen ninety eight ish um I don't

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,340
remember what version of Red Hat it was

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,830
six something I don't know for a while

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,480
it was a system administrator so I grew

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,500
up I was born right and then I went to

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,150
school

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,400
and I was in the Army for a bit and then

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,070
I got out and I became a system

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,810
administrator at OCAD University which

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,450
is actually in Michigan up here for

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,800
those of you who are from Ohio and I was

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,590
a network and since I'm in there for a

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,209
while I kind of moving people from

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,470
solaris to linux because i was a thing

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,970
back then right fighting the good fight

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,709
and at one point I ran into this like

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,010
crazy South African guy was doing

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:43,650
something really really interesting so I

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,080
joined a boon to during the very first

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,180
release which is really fun and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,950
eventually I now they let past nine

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,090
years I get paid to like do free

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,530
software stuff and it's like the

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,239
greatest thing ever so I'm a really cool

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,800
job my job used to be on the community

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,300
team working with with Jono he was my

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,450
boss for a while which is very

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,760
interesting and horrible but lately I've

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,739
I've kind of shifted over to it in

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,750
canonical what we call sour CDO section

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,970
which is cloud DevOps so I'm kind of the

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,489
for better or worse public face of a

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,260
Bluetooth server and cloud so I spent a

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,000
lot of time talking to people who uses

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,110
our stuff at scale and this gives me I

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,459
it's awesome because I get to hang out

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,040
with people like John Willis I don't

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,120
know who attended his doctor training so

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,459
I get to hang out with people like ham

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,070
all the time talking about problems that

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,750
people have at scale and like it really

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,010
gives me some perspective on things like

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,049
when you're listening to a guy at

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,000
Netflix talking about scalability right

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,440
when you know like how much traffic runs

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,549
through that thing right but it's also

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
interesting as well when you're hanging

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,400
out with like guy who is a administrator

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,870
at a small University or small business

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,120
or something and it's like what can I do

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,130
to help that person like how can I like

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,110
container eyes all Netflix's goodness

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,320
and deliver to you right because that's

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,850
like an operating system does so that's

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,209
pretty cool I gave a talk here about

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,650
puppet a very very long time ago I had

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,049
just discovered puppet because I don't

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,790
want to learn CF engine and i just

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,700
showed up in this and puppet back then

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,380
was like uh relatively small especially

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,989
compared to today and I just remember

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,459
showing up at IRC I was like hey I'm

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,010
giving a talk at this whole hio linux

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,140
fest about puppet and luca nice he was

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,370
like who are you like I was like I don't

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,260
know dude but can you like check my

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,140
slides make sure I'm not lying he was

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,700
like wow this is this is pretty cool and

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,780
um

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,570
and I are still friends which is really

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,140
great because it was very interesting at

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,030
the time I was just some guy who like

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,280
was really into puppet and all I did was

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,720
like say you know this saved me X amount

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,130
of time I should tell someone about this

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,220
so I did it my lug and then I did it on

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,090
linux best and like fast forward later

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,700
and now i'm doing this professionally

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,410
which is actually kind of scary so if

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,670
you're doing really cool stuff you

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,830
should like submit and tell people

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,630
things because you learn a lot of stuff

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,720
right like the cooper Nettie's talk

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,480
today was just excellent right so that

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,000
just really awesome since I'm in Ohio I

00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,900
really want to say that I'm really glad

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,490
you guys won the national championship

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,560
last year and that's great and all but

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,060
this year the Spartans are kind of

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,010
gunning for you normally we have a lot

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,950
of things in common right we both hate

00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,810
the University of Michigan which is fine

00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,760
which is fine I actually live in ann

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,340
arbor so it's like i'm a pilgrim but a

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,230
pilgrim in an O Holy Land so hey

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,640
Michigan week we keep the Canadians at

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,800
base Ohio doesn't have to deal with it

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,900
right then with their free perfect

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,790
health care and nice manners and stuff

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,790
ok so one day I'm hanging out so I have

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,070
a friend who works at a very very large

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,490
fruit company wink wink I can't say his

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,920
name so let's just call him Ken okay and

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,060
he visits he comes home every once in a

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,180
while and we're sitting around hanging

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,190
it beer and when I was the system

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,870
administrator at Oakland he was like my

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,470
student employee right you know they pay

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,820
him like not a lot of money and I was

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,440
like man remember all the stupid things

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,080
we did that we thought were so awesome

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,640
like back then doing linux see things he

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,440
was like oh god did we really try to

00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,840
like do this NFS thing and I was like

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,600
yeah dude so we sitting there and I was

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,040
like man I actually like have to give a

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,990
talk at a high linux fest so what I

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,070
should do is like we should figure out

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,980
all this stuff that we thought was

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,180
really smart that people might be doing

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,570
today and then i'll make a talked out of

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,940
it so that's that's that's that's kind

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,260
of like why I'm here like everything

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,790
that I used to think was really awesome

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,350
now if I look back I was like dude

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,760
that's totally wrong it was like god

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,130
don't remind me and then we started

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,130
drinking more to make the pain go away

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,090
so your linux users you guys know i'm

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,020
all about alcoholism ok so right like we

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,729
had this system is

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,110
really good we had a bunch of users we

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,210
have thousands of computer science

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,830
students finding every possible way to

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,500
break things right we thought it was so

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,509
cool and but like every piece of

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,889
infrastructure right now that I look

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,129
back at it is like man what kind of

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,930
decaying hot mess like have I created in

00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,069
the world right and you know that this

00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,960
happens to people all the time right

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:01,220
like sometimes you might go and be like

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,930
hey man I you sort of for this company

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,190
yeah man we had it was set up this way

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,289
and then like no one could figure it out

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,990
so we like redid everything happens all

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,759
the time it's really weird right like

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,229
what if our actual infrastructure in

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,630
America like work that way it would be

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,699
insane if we had to like not maintain

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,110
our roads see Ohio you guys maintain

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,360
your roads in Michigan we just put the

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,389
orange cones out and then we don't fix

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,650
anything right so I thought I knew at

00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,750
all I thought it was I thought I was a

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,330
pretty decent I wasn't like the world's

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,729
greatest system administrator um but I

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,240
you know I I knew that like automation

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:38,000
was a thing um so here I am with my real

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,190
model at my real IBM model m right like

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,430
I was like the living embodiment of

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,740
1990s linux guy right like it took me

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,319
like months to figure out how to like

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,430
copy music to that ipod in linux back of

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,960
the day remember how hard that was um I

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,490
had like solaris machine so like by the

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,659
backspace key never worked and I thought

00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,870
I don't know why I took this picture I

00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:03,469
just thought it was really funny of why

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,900
I would want to do this right the I look

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:08,300
I love this picture it's like we had

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,400
this like idea of what our system would

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,750
look like right and everything and you I

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,909
thought it was so clever right it's like

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,069
well all the Linux machines will be

00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:18,590
named after Saturn stuff right so the

00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,520
main thing and like every system that

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,770
connects to that will be like a

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,690
Saturnian moon so if SSH at Ephesus I

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,400
know exactly where all the windows

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,990
machines would be named after Jupiter

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,840
stuff right and like you come up with

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,130
like this convoluted like like you've

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,289
read this on slashdot where guys like

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,029
actually my under Firefly characters

00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,800
that Nevada that you know and then

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,810
you're like well I'll name stuff after

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,719
comments that interact with both things

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,339
and like like I had to ssh to a machine

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,260
called Huygens you know how horrible

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,420
that is to like spell like something's

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,070
like but that was like how right it was

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,350
like this is my this is you come to

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,790
Oakland universe is my

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,580
you know this is my network it's a

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,400
reflection of my personality holy God

00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,110
and then right and on top I had to have

00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,760
like the history of the this up there

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,470
that's the history of the unix timeline

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,780
you guys to see nothing right cuz like I

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,790
had to know it and and this was like my

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,490
little baby this was my beautiful and

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,390
unique snowflake so I thought I thought

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,520
it was pretty cool i was actually

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:17,860
running linux but on sun rays which like

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,200
son really did not support but we

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,780
figured it out it was awesome like we

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,290
had to do very very naughty things with

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,030
LD preload you guys know all about that

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,100
network printers I i was suffering with

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,500
cups way more and longer than most

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,110
people right I had something like 325

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,400
printers at one point now it's like the

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,170
future I'm like why do we have paper

00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,910
like I don't get it but they're still

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,190
there i asked cuz i was like man i

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,710
really want one of the old used HP cubes

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,550
right those things are awesome and they

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,590
kind of don't make him like that

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,790
anywhere we just SAT but that's one of

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,700
them right there it's like my favorite

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,330
ones got the law it's got two trades all

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,610
right sorry um right i had triple head

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,930
cuz i was totally like doing the matrix

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,000
thing and that was like way harder back

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,350
then like if you're struggling with like

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,380
nvidia you think you're struggling with

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:08,590
nvidia drivers today boy whoo man yeah

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,560
and i got the cool like I figured out

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,240
that like if I just tailed all the sis

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,190
logs and ran him through a log colorized

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,110
like when a professor would come by I

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,610
would look like i was doing stuff but I

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,890
was like really just like posting on

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,280
slashdot or whatever it was and I yeah

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,910
so there's a lot of things I've learned

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,230
from now until then that I was I was

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,480
like the more we talked about it the

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,220
more I was like man that's really really

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,400
horrible so that's where I came up with

00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:39,280
this idea what if I go back teach myself

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,980
things and then use that to like apply

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,970
for myself today right so if I can kind

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,250
of convince myself to be more

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,200
open-minded back n back then that means

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,120
today when the lead is hot you sexy

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,770
thing comes out I don't get all star gym

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,290
like that will never work in production

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,730
because I hate being that guy um so

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,340
we're gonna build a time machine this is

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,930
an interactive keynote right so this is

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,790
one of my favorite movies The Time

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,820
Machine it's based on a book that's when

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,400
people write words and then you buy them

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,630
but most people so I really like this

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,340
movie growing up but most people think

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,560
of this this is like way cooler this is

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,640
the this is the cool time machine so

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,280
we're gonna build a time machine and

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,720
then disclaimer before we proceed

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,310
because this can get dangerous right

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,840
automatic of the Trekkies are like well

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,170
actually dude you can't mess with the

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,180
time loop so what I want to do is we

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,140
don't want to totally mess things up so

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,750
if we're going to go back in time and

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,460
convince ourselves of general concepts

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,660
right it's not gonna be like always been

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,640
on the Patriots because you know they're

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,000
cheating right that's like not fair you

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,250
can't do that so also generally speaking

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,260
everything I'm talking to you today is

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,360
like kind of meant for generalized

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,890
software guys like us if you make

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
software that like keeps planes in the

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,700
sky or pacemakers and stuff do not

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,050
listen to anything I'm saying in fact

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,090
you guys keep going I don't need like my

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,550
insulin pump to like not work because

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,990
you decided to like run a pre-release

00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,550
version of Coober Nettie's because you

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,910
went to ohio linux fest and listen to

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,280
jorge castro so there there are way way

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,920
way smarter people than me on this so i

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,810
challenge you to go find the truth is

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,370
out there um because there's rules to

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,800
these sorts of things right you can't

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,120
just change things so and I wanted to

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,470
keep the talk interesting you can't just

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
go back and be like containers are a

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,260
thing right like that's just not fun um

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,570
so ideally we go back in time we come

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,250
back and my server room looks like a lot

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,240
like this right like that's what's gonna

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:32,010
happen to me right if we mess up we come

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,720
back and there's Nazis writing dinosaurs

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:37,470
and all this kind of like craziness

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,410
right but but what actually will happen

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,750
is what I'm really afraid of so how many

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,580
guys like Star Trek next generation all

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,500
right awesome so there is this great

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,210
episode you should go watch it tonight

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,270
when you get home on netflix part by

00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,620
bluetooth thing um and the name of the

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,000
episode is called tapestries one of my

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,620
favorite episodes how many of you are

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,690
familiar with this episode this is like

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,820
the greatest star trek episode ever so

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,470
the card is kind of in the same

00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,850
situation I am right now right going

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,250
back in time he's like if only I would

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,990
have done these things different

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,300
could have you know been more

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,270
responsible and things like that or bad

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,730
things would happen right and so Q's I'm

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,530
nibud omnipotent being says okay fine

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,910
and Picard's like well I can't do that

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,680
kind of can't mess with the timeline

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,150
right so he says fine everything every

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,220
decision you make will only affect you

00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,110
right so it gives him his wish she comes

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,130
back in time and Picard is a totally

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,800
different person he's a lieutenant

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,600
junior grade right and he's like what

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,550
happened to me i'm a man breath passion

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,410
he's like doesn't run the enterprise

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,660
like everyone's like your kind of it you

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,940
come not an awesome Starfleet officer

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,920
and he was like that's what happened and

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,450
Q was like I gave you exactly what you

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,700
wanted you want it to be more

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,070
responsible and do all these things so

00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,720
you also didn't take any risks right

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,170
that's why you're this boring really

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,600
horrible boring person right and Picard

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,820
said this man is bereft of passion right

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,450
I would rather die than be that man and

00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,220
live that life q so we're gonna proceed

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,920
in this way and we're kind of kind of

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,390
just let it rip um I just realized I

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,830
totally spoil the episode for those of

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,210
you that have seen it but it's your

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,150
fault man that thing's been out since

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,410
like 1993 it's not my fault you go to a

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,040
linux fest and you don't get a Star Trek

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:18,360
II oh come on man sting um so I got a

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,120
video here hold on this will be off that

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,440
my promise so all right we're getting

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,990
our time machine and we're traveling

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,730
through time ass to observers will

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,589
actually say that we're actually going

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,050
through a wormhole because this is

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,700
Stargate I have Stargate jokes also also

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,660
one of my favorite shows so we're going

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:40,770
back in time now and the years now 2002

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,030
wish let's say yeah okay so we go don't

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,620
worry there won't be ghouls or anything

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:49,080
in this all right so all right so we're

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,000
here a lot of things are the same we

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,830
still have linux we don't want to go to

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,810
back far in time because n we have to be

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,300
with solaris and i never want to go

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,210
through that again right um I'm still

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,910
system administrator so the the quality

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:06,000
of services is still a thing I still

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,870
always wear metallica shirt jeans always

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,120
a thinkpad that hasn't changed a they

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,260
tried and then it was horrible and no

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,750
not see so we're good right we haven't

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,520
messed with the time the time continuing

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,660
what's different though my understanding

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,430
of complexities that

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,589
especially looking at systems right and

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,420
back then we were on the verge of

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,860
commodity right like AWS was just

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,089
starting to come out and like a lot of

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,740
people didn't get it right there like

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,759
it's just like a linode with an API

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,259
what's big deal mmm right and I was

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,790
really good at machine level

00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:39,449
problem-solving right this machine is

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,889
busted SSH blammo okay figure it out fix

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,600
my puppet thing so it's like fixed

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,189
forever and I'm doing everything all

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,079
manually and stuff and I kind of had

00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:48,660
that 1990s linux attitude right where it

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,610
was like my stuff is really awesome my

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,189
up time like you find yourself posting

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,129
on the internet it's like oh yeah 372

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,660
days guy awesome that means I haven't

00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:01,350
applied security patches in years right

00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:03,569
um so I had this attitude that my

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,970
beautiful unique snowflake system is a

00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,850
handcrafted master piece of art and

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,529
here's oh here's another disclaimer as

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:14,129
well because I'm going him back in time

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:16,290
and preaching to myself I can't that way

00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:17,370
like I would I can't offend you because

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,569
I'm not really preaching to you I'm

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,430
preaching to myself so it's more of a

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:21,600
narcissistic thing that I'm none of

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,240
thing so I'm going to start to preach to

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,560
myself a lot and hopefully I'm preaching

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,699
to the choir because I had a lot of

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,370
people check these slides and they're

00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:30,569
like preach it brother so um you might

00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,910
not agree with some of the things I say

00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:34,980
so everything that's an orange is what

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,540
1990s George is going to say and then

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,009
everything in purple when you see the

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,990
slide that's what I believe today and

00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:42,779
then I'm gonna like convince you that

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:46,410
I'm right I think unless I'm not that's

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:48,209
fine too um so you guys have heard this

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,180
before how many have not heard the term

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,490
pets versus cattle before how many year

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,990
okay let me back up how many you're

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,459
using Linux professionally like I says

00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,350
sysadmin or stuff but raise your hands

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:01,439
keep them up keep them up how many of

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,650
you are doing that on the cloud whoa

00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,980
holy smokes okay um all right put your

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,870
hands down how many you are not using

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,179
Linux professionally or you're just here

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:15,299
a hobbyist you just think it's cool okay

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,799
that's really cool all right um how many

00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,569
your students anyone here from like osu

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,770
computer science club and stuff welcome

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:24,360
i totally get you back back when I was

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,740
like your age I used to go to these

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,530
shows and there'd be like an old dude up

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,600
here telling me how i would do stuff and

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,750
I remember I remember his name is Chris

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,270
DiBona which is

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,010
just kind of funny and he was like hey

00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,870
when you guys get out there in the world

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,640
these are the technologies you should

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:45,460
know and he was like anyone guess what

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:48,780
the technology was a long time ago let's

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,770
just say that I don't know early 2000s

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,560
hey yes really is that what you're gonna

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,570
answer they still make those no no he

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,040
lamp was the thing back then right there

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,840
like if you're in college and you learn

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,570
lamp you will make a lot of money when

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,830
you get out of college right um so I've

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,120
got that slight for you guys at the end

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,120
I'm gonna show you how you're gonna like

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,920
kick ass as the new future linux guys

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,850
and then you get to submit talks and

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:14,260
i'll be like you're totally wrong kid um

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,090
so this is the pets versus cattle like

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,880
you hear this Ally and DevOps talks and

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,440
what what is it right it's the general

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,210
gist is like I was used to having

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,820
machines that were beautiful unique

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,030
snowflakes right they had cool names

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,890
like thethe this and minus and right I

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,330
do this at home right like my my servers

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,460
are named after my wife right so I have

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,070
Jillybean jealous a raptor right I'm

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,080
attached to these things right like they

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,240
guy give them names so like when I break

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,100
them it like hurts me as a person it's

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,170
like getting getting my dog getting

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,480
kicked butt today if you look at the way

00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,800
people are doing ops it's totally

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,450
opposite and you would think it's

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,390
totally opposite of what you're used to

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,960
reading in like your unix book one of my

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,000
first ones John McCallum Linux book and

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
I was like wait this is right until you

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,850
start to hang out with people who are

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,140
doing this at scale right like when you

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,490
talk to somebody at Netflix they're like

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,900
we don't even know like where some stuff

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,640
runs it's in a container somewhere and

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,990
it's got this weird ID I didn't really

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,350
care they're thinking more about the

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,550
service itself so when you when your

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,010
machines that are giving you your

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,470
services now are instances and they are

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,180
repeatable and they're disposable and

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,800
you don't care about the more the kind

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,990
of more like cattle right right this

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,760
one's this was not really working Ryan

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,470
let's a systemic as you BAM you kill it

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,010
right and it's delicious it's it's

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,230
really good so its repeal ah I feel that

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,880
repeatability is a new up time right

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,950
because you have to do security patches

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,290
and you have to do things like that so

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,450
that your your ability to ensure that a

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,290
complex system comes up every single

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,810
time via

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,390
exact same way it's supposed to I

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,850
believe this is the new metric of I'm a

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,590
good sysadmin these days and it goes

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,540
beyond automating everything because

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,220
it's not just automating a server right

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,360
remember when you would used to get a

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,140
certain you got this brand-new HP

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,240
proliant oh there is 0 us at the new g3

00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,530
suite right and like and you would do in

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,180
the use like okay this machine is gonna

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,800
be a web server therefore puppet you

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,630
need to do a beezy buh-buh-buh-buh-buh

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,680
right so you started from the bottom up

00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,660
right now We strongly believe and I mean

00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,000
like in the booths you kind of cloud

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,680
world that everything is kind of more

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,330
top-down right your kind of thinking

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,910
about the service first instead of the

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,010
machine that's why when you look at

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,360
something like cougar Nettie's or Apache

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,650
mezzos or something that makes a lot

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,960
more sense to you when you start to

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,910
think of it that way so it's not just a

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,280
server it's the applications as well and

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:39,400
applications today are written totally

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,600
different from what they were a while

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,990
ago when things like horizontal

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,970
scalability like didn't exist so people

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,610
are solving these problems and we should

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,040
steal their ideas and I feel that part

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,130
of my primary job is ensuring that those

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,270
cool ideas that people are doing is

00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,250
delivered to you in a regular basis and

00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,070
consumable chunks that you don't have to

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,170
be a genius to understand right and it

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,030
kind of you know it kind of gets that

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,310
our micro services for me they might

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,030
they might not be we certainly weren't

00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,620
doing any micro service based stuff in

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,330
any of the applications I was deploying

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,130
but that's like a question you should

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:20,590
have so your real actual infrastructure

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,270
won't look anything like that that UNIX

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,520
book like every time I hang out with

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,690
someone from google or is a guy who's

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,600
working on Cooper Nettie's he's like aw

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,310
it's so good to be to be an open-source

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,620
thing that we made at Google again

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,000
because you know we all learned we all

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,170
grew up on kind of the lamp stack right

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,760
and then you get hired by google and

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,830
you're using all these weird things that

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,930
don't match what anyone else is doing I

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,970
was like so I found that comment really

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:47,500
interesting so yeah definitely learn the

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,760
lamp stuff but get through that chapter

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,190
as fast as possible because there's like

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,210
awesomer stuff and more complex stuff

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:56,169
that you guys are going to figure out

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:59,559
while I retire this is

00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:02,320
this is another one this is the whole

00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:04,299
DevOps here comes the DevOps part is

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
like when you wear sysadmin and then

00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,789
they were developers right and they were

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,739
actually physically on separate floors

00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,379
which now seems very crazy to me right

00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,909
and they would they would deliver their

00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:15,070
application to you and then it was your

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:16,749
job to make sure it ran well right then

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,759
of course what happens right it's like a

00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:20,649
student in a stupid little visual basic

00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,840
script and then you go a new copy onto

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:24,700
the web server and it doesn't work

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,950
because he hard-coded local hosts in

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,239
there right that's like that's

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,679
fundamentally what DevOps is supposed to

00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:31,539
solve okay really it's a lot more

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,129
complicated than that but fundamentally

00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:35,739
right what a developer thinks the world

00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:38,350
looks like and what sysadmin thinks the

00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:39,789
world looks like can can be different

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,989
things you might actually be the same

00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:46,269
person which is really strange um so a

00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:48,159
few years ago I don't know you know

00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:50,109
actually more like five years ago we

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,419
kind of restructured be more of a DevOps

00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:54,399
organization and it was kind of painful

00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:56,559
because it's not really a technology

00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:59,169
problem it's like a human teamwork

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,840
problem right so we do this weird thing

00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,730
where like on our team we have Ops guys

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,869
and they rotate in and out and when the

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,210
app breaks it's everyone's

00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:08,739
responsibility to fix it not just a

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,659
developer guy who throws code over the

00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:16,809
wall or the sysadmin guy right and this

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,730
this is a very I think it's really cool

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,049
because when you look at job postings

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,419
now for like what people want in a

00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:24,700
system administrator right they kind of

00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:26,529
expect you to know the platforms that

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,330
you're deploying right so if you're in a

00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,369
rail shop you kind of expect it to kind

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,929
of know how to debug that stuff right

00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:34,480
and then your developers are kind of

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,009
expected to kind of have a stake in how

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,049
operations work because they're the ones

00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:40,299
that right the application so everybody

00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,309
talks about this right and every time I

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,600
read a DevOps book or I see someone

00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,450
giving a talk it's like this is really

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,070
advanced common sense but it's hard

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,950
because it's a human thing and humans

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,129
are in our fallible people so it's

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,929
something that you really struggle with

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,609
all the time and you have to have the

00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,690
discipline as an organization to make

00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,669
that work so I'll give you an example

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,980
because everyone always thinks it's a

00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,570
sysadmin guys who aren't the the leading

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,309
right it's like developers have to drag

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,289
this admins into the cloud so they can

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,120
get cool stuff right so I'm working with

00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,400
a with

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,190
guy I don't want to call him out but his

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,240
name is Michael Hall and he was like man

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:20,370
I really really hate doing mojo specs so

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,890
in canonical we open source all of our

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,530
infrastructure so all of our juju charms

00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,850
and we have the CI tool called mojo

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,830
which actually deploys all of our

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,080
services and production right and every

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,140
developer who wants to run something in

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,120
our production OpenStack has to write a

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,100
mojo spec which basically describes how

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,720
the services you know all this all this

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,090
kind of like really complicated stuff he

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,059
was like man I really wish I could just

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:47,580
give is my code for my django project

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:50,160
and then just get out of there right and

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,510
everybody wants it to be that way right

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,070
but it takes a lot of discipline to be

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,500
like no you can't do it that way because

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,290
we do it this way and it kind of forces

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,850
you in a certain workflow and sometimes

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,010
people don't like that but it takes

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,600
someone looking from the top down to say

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,610
you know what if we all did this as an

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,260
organization it stops things like

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,559
siloing it helps you share best

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,050
practices right all the good things that

00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:15,120
really awesome ops companies do right

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,410
when you kind of have that discipline

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
you get all those benefits so it's

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,070
really tough um but you should do it

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,380
it's it's pretty awesome there are a lot

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,510
of resources on how to run a lean dev

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,620
ops ii tell us all stuff so that's some

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,940
homework if you're interested in that

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,010
kind of stuff i used to love spending

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,150
time to ensure each server is up and

00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,550
running right it was like the most

00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,290
embarrassing thing if a server ever went

00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,030
down it's like man I'm the Linux guy

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,460
like Windows guys are gonna make fun of

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,980
me like what's happening ah but they got

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,020
to deal with exchange haha you know um

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,700
so like it was it was like it was like a

00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,110
big deal right like it was like okay you

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,780
know I've got like the pager thing set

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,040
up so like you know I'm a month in

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,840
advance if I'm ever gonna run out of

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,750
disk or whatever right because this is

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,059
my warp core baby this is like tuned to

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,460
my specifications I don't want some

00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,870
designer from who designed the ship to

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,120
tell me how to run my own work or I'm

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,770
out here in the field am I here like you

00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,700
know the metal meets the ground this is

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:14,309
like what I want to do so an example

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,260
would be like hey we have this

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,810
production application and the database

00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,040
went away right the database should

00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,090
never go away because the application

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,530
doesn't know what to do if I can't

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,870
connect to the database

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,430
right so 1990s George is thinking that

00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,430
is horrible how do we do things back

00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,450
then right we scaled up right it's like

00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,370
I know what we knew we need more

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,430
reliable hardware I should totally spent

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,400
250 thousand dollars on that son server

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:41,810
right um redundant power supplies and

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,700
stuff it never occurred to me back then

00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:47,100
that if an application can't connect to

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,410
the database and it doesn't like handle

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,320
that that that might be the applications

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,760
fault right because why we were used to

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,740
doing the monolithic thing right it was

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,080
like the UNIX way right this database

00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,030
server will never will never go down it

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,610
never occurred to us right that we could

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,650
just throw a bunch of really cheap x86

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,270
servers at something right and the

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,670
application could be designed for

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,650
failure right but the cloud forces you

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,610
to design things that way that's why

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,450
generally speaking they're more reliable

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,690
and cheaper that's why companies like us

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,910
exist now um because as it ends up this

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,250
is totally and typical to everything I

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,380
learned is host reliability doesn't

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,900
matter individual machines will always

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,540
break right if you get that the bigger

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,970
data center gets and stuff all those

00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,910
hard drives right eventually they will

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,530
fail right and who like I remember

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,030
seeing my first talk when like I read I

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,950
heard that like there's Google people

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,390
who just walked down aisles removed

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,190
drives and slap it in and the software

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,200
does everything magically right and

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,510
that's that was totally like learning

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,840
learning your mind to switch that kind

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,700
of mentality was um was really difficult

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,920
for me it's a service up time that

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,120
matters right how many did any of you

00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,430
guys attend the Cooper Nettie's talk

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,320
today is that guy here where is he is he

00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,020
not here oh ok didn't come to my talk I

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,610
went to his I get it that's cool right

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,860
but they do like a rolling upgrade we're

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,570
like yeah do an upgrade I'll take some

00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,860
containers down some up a load balance

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,000
smart load balancer does all the things

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:18,360
designed for host to just go away right

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,950
um and I really feel the applications

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,010
that are not conducive to this kind of

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,770
horizontal scaling like really don't fit

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:29,280
well in the cloud in the cloud in the

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,720
cloud world right it looks a lot like a

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,820
cloud database looks a lot more like

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Cassandra and something horizontally

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,909
scalable than the other proprietary mono

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,140
lithic vertical one that they charge you

00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:43,500
a lot of money I don't want to call

00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,059
anyone out starts with an o so and

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,919
everything will fail eventually right

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,450
because it's hardware right like when

00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,830
you hear someone say you know we used to

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,450
use redundant power supplies now we

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,760
don't because not the node dies we just

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,650
don't care right and then we saved a lot

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,450
of power and money on not buying power

00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,909
supplies and we just bought more servers

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:03,270
right that's like that's like really

00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:06,150
weird and we let the sun fire is like

00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,559
boom all right whatever um and you gotta

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,470
embrace the chaos monkey how many of you

00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,080
have not heard of chaos monkey I'm not

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,549
okay so when I heard about this I

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,260
thought this blew my mind right so

00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,870
netflix they kind of know a few things

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,900
about about ops and they're like we

00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,220
actually had this suite of programs

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,409
called the chaos monkey was the first

00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,120
one and what it does is it goes through

00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:29,280
our production infrastructure and it

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,500
just blows stuff up I was like so wait a

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,730
minute I'm sitting you're spending all

00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,110
my time trying to keep things reliable

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,780
you guys are writing software that goes

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,270
and disconnect switches right fills up

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,770
discs like and they're not just

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,390
practicing on their laptops kind of

00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,840
thumb there like in product you've what

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,760
we doing that's crazy right but they're

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,220
really really really good at it now

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,429
right and it makes her service like a

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,140
lot more reliable right so we have one

00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:57,059
of these internally at our work and I

00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,500
think you should too right what happens

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:00,900
when that switch turns out i don't know

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,190
we never tested it right the disaster

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,900
recovery guys in the back of like I've

00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:07,200
been saying this for 15 yeah I get it

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,809
dude I got it um you know but like to

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,460
actually purposely introduce this stuff

00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:13,590
that's crazy and they got different ones

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,510
now they got like security monkey that

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,360
like opens random port lligat what's we

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,679
guys doing like it's crazy um but they

00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,539
embraced it right and they're really

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,820
really good at it now right that's what

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,669
that service is very reliable now

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,409
compared to some of the other services

00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:31,110
that do that why because ops is a

00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,090
competitive advantage isn't it right if

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,820
you as a system administrator can get

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,799
your developers to save 5-10 minutes

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,270
here they're right your entire

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,429
organization becomes really efficient

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,710
and we're talking at the scale of like a

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:45,090
very large percentage of North American

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,340
traffic running through netflix you

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,110
understand why right because when an

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,250
old-school media company launches their

00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,980
new streaming service

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,520
falls over doesn't it looking at you

00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,740
sling TV um and you want to practice

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,540
this every day but you have to get in

00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,810
there goes a discipline again because

00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,940
let's face it being a board is way more

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,230
efficient than being like the enterprise

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,000
right like that whole free will fun

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,680
don't worry about it but you know a

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,400
whole bunch of something that's generic

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,990
and reusable is a lot more usable and

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,480
easier to debug and a lot more

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,550
observable right then your beautiful

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,100
unique snowflake right and we see we

00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:27,360
still see this it like saddens me I was

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,890
talking to an organization they were

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,350
very large very confident they're like

00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,210
well we finally figured out how to do

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,610
OpenStack it took me it took us three

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,550
months and we finally got it all set up

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,350
and I know your way makes it so like

00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,410
OpenStack deploys in 11 minutes and it

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,730
does um I don't really like that was

00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:48,420
like three months I'm kind of attached

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,460
to it now and I was like uh or like I

00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,260
was sinking in my head I was like are we

00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,780
becoming so emotionally attached to our

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,250
scripts that if like I always try to

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,890
think I'm trying to remove code and

00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,510
complexity for my systems right um so

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,960
don't get too attached pets first cattle

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,970
um and I would have the same rooms like

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,140
it takes time to deploy things right why

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,090
is the hurry why is everyone in a hurry

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,670
why is everyone a speed speed speed dr.

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,860
so fast speed speed speed speed right um

00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,080
I would do two major deployments a year

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,750
right cuz it was a university it's it

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,720
was like a few weeks before the student

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,790
came came came to campus right and I was

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,140
like that was my time to fix bugs in

00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:28,320
production right and that's that's the

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,450
way it was um but when things are

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,190
reproducible it's like really smooth to

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,650
get things up and running and smooth is

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,200
fast right if like there are no air if

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,850
you hit enter whatever it is or your get

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,460
commit whatever it is that triggers your

00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,840
magic right if that's all nice and

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,510
automated you'd literally just sit there

00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,100
and wait for it to return um that's

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,470
really fast that's smooth and that

00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,550
becomes fast right so deployment should

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,790
be routine that's something that we

00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,920
didn't do at all um now that I talked to

00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:57,750
people like it's crazy when you hear

00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,510
people deploying their their apps at

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:02,100
major big services like multiple times a

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,680
day right like you guys have read

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,450
Facebook's blogs and you're like well

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,280
that's crazy that's awesome and that

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,410
exercises your DevOps workflow I was

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,360
talking about before right and you get

00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,470
really really good at that um because

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,030
you don't wanna learn to set 2 a.m.

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,700
we've all been there it's like man why

00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,440
did I why did I have to use on FS it's

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,510
always NFS is always involve you ever

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,040
noticed that like it's always you know I

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,840
was like oh why did I have to do that

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,460
why are there lock files here like I

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,490
should I remove those I don't know what

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,410
too late oh um you know and there was

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,950
there was a lot of very human ish things

00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,600
happening here right like if you just

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,770
let go and embrace the automation it's

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,300
like you know you're gonna make a web

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,950
service that will just automatically

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,350
generate your doctor containers then you

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,310
don't have to worry about this whole

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,860
container soup you're putting yourself

00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,720
in right and speed is the bonus that you

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,890
get out of all this right like people

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,330
trying to set yeah one of me I want to

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,040
speed everything up ba ba ba but speed

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,450
is the bonus and speed makes your users

00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,730
happy does it could be more productive

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,520
and that's generally speaking where you

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,320
want to be um so just get you sick going

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,730
to 88 miles an hour all the time then

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,930
it's not a problem than 80 miles an hour

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,430
you don't have to like do all the crazy

00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,670
things that you need to do to get to 80

00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:08,840
miles an hour right um one of my

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,580
favorite students would be like I need

00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,230
root access to my web server I'm 18

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:17,060
years old and I just learned PHP it's

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:19,580
like okay um so we would I would you

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,960
know what kid gee get yourself your own

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,040
operating system give me your code and

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,480
then get out of my face and I will

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,310
handle this so like now hopefully

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,030
everyone gets us by now and I know I'm

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,030
