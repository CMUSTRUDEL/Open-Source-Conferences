	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
now tanner is a shin is really cool it

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:07,379
is like vmware except you don't or it's

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,170
like virtualization but like you don't

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,269
pay for the performance penalty they're

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,490
like really nice remember the first time

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,650
you saw docker doing its thing you're

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,480
like whoa awesome I can finally redeploy

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,029
rails apps without like breaking my

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,670
servers so you know it's like really

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,350
sweet and I really like them right and

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,570
it's nice because they let you move

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,070
stuff around really easy right so I can

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,830
move stuff between local host on my

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,510
laptop my development cloud and my

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,270
production cloud and it's the exact same

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,309
thing the entire step that's really

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,530
powerful right and instead of doing the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,120
whole hey you deploy this I'm going to

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,739
the bar together we test them verify

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,390
right and how you actually do this it is

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,250
up to you like I said there's different

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,559
workflows just find one that worked for

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,030
you and and have a plan I got set a

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,340
canonical we use a tool called mojo to

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,270
like do all of this and it makes things

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,190
nice and fast and easy for us um this

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,600
will be controversial time to order

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,070
hardware for the next quarter right and

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
I'll be like what pro line through no

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,729
could I get to play with and then we're

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,159
sitting around I was like man why why

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,320
don't we own hardware now like I'm

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,700
actually starting to see really really

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,080
confidence system administrators that

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,390
like I've never been in a data center

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,460
now right the wrong kids it's like nice

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,090
macbook you know what a server looks

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,920
like i dont care yay um so that it's

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,780
very very really it is very interesting

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,810
right we're like you can actually do a

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,360
lot of things that very large very

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,770
complex without having to like have that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,869
initial investment of the hardware and

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,439
that's very powerful that's why cloud is

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,270
a thing it's really really easy to say

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,890
you know what maybe I should be running

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,110
some services on the west coast because

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,930
there's actual hurricane coming on the

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,970
East Coast and I also think it's really

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,049
interesting how many people I've run

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,939
into this is actually kind of

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,680
embarrassing that like do understand

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,240
cloud in AWS and I'm like hey where do

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,490
you keep your stuff he's like us East

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,350
one I was like you are kind of missing

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,490
pointing but there's always a hurricane

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,259
that comes and then that's when everyone

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,869
realizes I should really learn how to

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,039
like move my stuff around because that's

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,610
how the pros do it and you should do it

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,780
and it's like relatively cheap process

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,530
compared to how it used to be I used to

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,600
be on a phone

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,920
hey other university do you want to do

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,240
like some kind of like i'll send you

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,950
hard drives you send me you know

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,040
off-site backup does i don't want to pay

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,150
for Iron Mountain okay um and it's

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,740
really nice because you get a lot of

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,020
really cool tools and services that you

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,180
can like give permissions to and if a

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,500
student messes up a system right it just

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,959
blow it away you don't care anymore

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,560
right as opposed to who's who's messing

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,810
with the production like election it was

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,180
so cool you join a university and you

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,739
got a shell account like and I was like

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,150
really hard to get back in the day so I

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,390
was like that's why I went to college

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,040
they get a shell account right um and

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,890
you get like your home whole thing now

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,440
it's like man I could just give someone

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,370
a WS creds and they go crazy and do all

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,650
sorts of stuff and if they mess up

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,769
that's fine um we'll just blow it away

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,450
it doesn't it doesn't break my ability

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,600
to serve production services oh my god i

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,390
really have time um so you'd like to

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,130
think oh yes this is all amazing this

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,890
AWS thing is great and then I realized

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,900
wait a minute why would anyone want to

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,519
deal with IT department when they have a

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,079
credit card and I started to think hey

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,320
wait a minute I'm also competing with

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,600
Amazon and Azure and Google Cloud right

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,190
I remember what is like I want to run a

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,200
production service it's like yes follow

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,640
these steps all this web form bah blah

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
blah blah blah then we get a p.o then we

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,120
get your hardware and that or I could

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,239
just go to Amazon and not even ever talk

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,590
to George ever again that condescending

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,720
1990s Baath guy that no one wants to

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,970
talk to right and that is a big deal

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,410
right and then when we talk when we

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,150
talked to companies all the time that do

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,920
that there's like a really great pattern

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,180
or it's like here's our old stuff in

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,820
production that works and we don't touch

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,260
it right and then here's our new thing

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,570
this is gonna be our new cloud this is

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,769
our OpenStack or whatever it is we're

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,299
making that's gonna be we're going to

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,239
eventually move all that stuff here

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,430
right and then this dotted box here is

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,290
all the secret stuff that departments

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,640
are running an AWS that I have no

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,440
control over but i'm responsible for

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,340
your like yikes but that's a thing

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,299
that's a thing um so you know it's one

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,799
of those things where it's like you're

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,260
sounding an alarm to yourself that's

00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,390
saying these tools are really great

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,340
right but they also empower users to do

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,380
whatever they want so in a way

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,610
especially if you're like the kind of

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,530
person that likes to host your own

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,889
hardware right these tools are really

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,999
great but those tools

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,909
especially if you don't master them can

00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:34,259
also be your demise right but why I've

00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:36,310
tried to club it's like expensive and

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,419
George what you need to learn is you

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,759
need to learn to punch above your weight

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,249
right and what does that really mean the

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,400
gist of what i want to say here is right

00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:47,819
if a bunch of guys at Facebook or Google

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,110
or Twitter or whatever high scale Linux

00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,509
thing that runs the modern world is

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,849
right the more you learn to operate at

00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:57,520
that scale right the better off you will

00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:59,680
be right even if you don't think you

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,419
need that so unique kind of need to be

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,699
like that defiant right who likes deep

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,770
space nine right so this ship it was

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,180
like a design mistake the guns were too

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,770
big and you shot the guns too much you

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,240
would like blow up it was like but it

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,500
totally punched above this way that's

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,050
why the ship is way cooler in the

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,699
enterprise telling you so you need to

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,039
learn to be that like scrappy kind of

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,009
you know what we need to model our

00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,719
services the way we do business um after

00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,629
like people who have really figured it

00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:27,430
out and know how to do it well and I

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,870
remember the first time I tried cloud I

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,870
was like this is horrible I don't

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,610
understand what's going on here right a

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,589
lot of people they try to take their

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,110
whole their old applications right and

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,539
they just copy them whole hog into like

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,330
AWS and I this is just really expensive

00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:45,219
VMware but it's not right everything

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,069
from your application to how you manage

00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:50,289
stuff and how you do cloud is just all

00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:52,719
about your architecture as opposed to if

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,889
I copy and paste I'm going to redo and

00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,719
move to the cloud but I'm going to bring

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:57,490
all my baggage with me right like why

00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,259
would you do that and that's when people

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,990
really make platform decisions right

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,060
that's when people say well you know

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,589
maybe it now might be a time that's why

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,649
people use a boon to the public cloud

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:10,899
right they had to change how they do

00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:12,580
everything on deploying stuff in a cloud

00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,289
and when you do that all of a sudden

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,719
you're like you know maybe it's time to

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,099
look at a different way everything from

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:21,180
the operating system to how you do bit

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,409
of a sudden it's all up for grabs right

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,729
one of my favorite things George I never

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:28,750
have time to automate and that's like

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:30,520
this time loop horrible like like oh

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,870
it's like a horrible time loop Star Trek

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,349
episode right where it's like you're

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,300
stuck in this or the Greek Sisyphean guy

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,830
right who like he keeps rolling the rock

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,590
up and it slips down and he gets stuck

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,000
on that like

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,370
have to actually have the discipline to

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,750
be like we can't go on this way we have

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,770
to move forward and do do the way things

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,320
people who are smarter than me are doing

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,420
it right I did or like I can't do the

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,920
cloud I work at a bank right I can't do

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,050
the cloud I work on health well I get

00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,700
that but now you're starting to see

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,500
banks are running out of AWS and it's

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,480
kind of weird and even if the public

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,560
health isn't for you the economics of

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,750
cloud are such a big shift that even

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,640
running your local hardware in a cloud

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,270
style which is why people really like

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,830
things like OpenStack and number four

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,740
really common makes me sad they're like

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm too small like I don't really like

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,300
need all this kind of stuff all this

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,040
kind of overhead I think I think that's

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,700
a shame if you have that attitude like

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,650
you should be totally trying to take the

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,440
best practices that other smarter people

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,700
figured out and deploy that for yourself

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,440
right because all the sources you just

00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,810
about code right there like the coca be

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,970
above above yeah I get that but the open

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,220
sourcing of expertise between ourselves

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,990
as professionals I believe is just as

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,120
important as the code right though I

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,130
have a great Colonel if like nobody

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,450
knows how to use it right um and it gets

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,860
more and more complicated when you look

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,360
at some of these services and you guys

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,760
actually ever tried to deploy OpenStack

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,120
by hand not a good did you have a good

00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,310
time that's what I'm talking about it's

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,830
cuz you didn't use Madison juju I'm just

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,600
kidding I told you I promised I wouldn't

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,140
make it all in a boon to commercial uh

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,150
but it is just kidding um so even if

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,920
even if you don't like these tools right

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,570
you're like I tried mazes and it kind of

00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,130
wasn't for me or maybe I kind of liked

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,110
doing things that I way there are

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,640
certain what you want might not be the

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,810
exact tools these people are using maybe

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,870
you have a different view of the world

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,250
on how things should operate right but

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,840
there are certain properties of these

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,090
large-scale systems that you totally

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,500
want right service self-healing is

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,810
really nice write a piece of hardware

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,040
blew up somewhere and somebody moved a

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,420
container somewhere else I don't even

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,280
know where it is but my service is up

00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,260
and running that's really really nice

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,970
right sure the pager still goes off but

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,250
like your service is up and it's working

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,600
and that's really great automated

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,160
replication is just such a nice thing

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,880
it's like our sink except but I have to

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,200
type anything right honey and you guys

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,630
using Seth

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,100
it's like the great it okay so when you

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,640
get back be like things that George is

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,530
probably right on maybe the cats fce pH

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,360
really great stuff and it does like

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,830
fossa some replication it does like

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,620
really awesome stuff like I run it at

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,450
home it's like that good but it just

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,690
makes things really really much nicer

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,810
when you're using this advanced software

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,020
even at your at your level having failed

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,090
overage realigns magical networking

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,030
right like like when I try to understand

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,440
like Network layers and stuff i got like

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,850
fuses stuff but it's like really nice

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,830
when the cloud handles that for you it's

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,130
like I want an instance here's the IP

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,540
address then Cara came from yay um and

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,030
it's also really nice to decouple

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,980
services from the hardware right like

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,750
sometimes you don't really care where it

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,970
is as long as this the application is

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,740
getting the CPU the RAM and the

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,570
performance that it needs maybe I don't

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,940
actually care what physical hosts it's

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,500
running on or vm right and also security

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,780
it's really nice to have really smart

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,490
people figuring out the models of doing

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,040
all these things and you get the direct

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,780
benefit um so like we want it to look

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,430
like this magical unicorn that's why

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,340
when you see like the first time I saw

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,860
uh the way mezzos worked i was like wow

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,720
that's like a magical unicorn of like

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,020
awesomeness I need to I need to do that

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,570
um bottom line is your users are gonna

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,590
want these things and George and if you

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,600
don't give it to him they're gonna find

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,690
a way to get it right and that might not

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,160
be the IT guy at your company right they

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,470
might get it from another provider and

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,730
then tada it's like I remember the first

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,710
time a student came up to me he was like

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,720
yeah I kind of gave up i'm trying to get

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,610
a server to like host here i just did on

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,340
amazon instead I was like all right

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,960
whatever floats your boat idiot and then

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,750
like I'm sick about I was like oh my god

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,250
that guy was totally right why would I

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,280
want to work with myself when I could

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,740
just get the service that I want um guys

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,060
ever seen his movie Time Bandits I love

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,410
this movie has nothing to do with this

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,910
talk but when I saw this picture I was

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,660
like god I love this movie was so great

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:53,030
um yeah I I wanted to do like a joke for

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,130
every time movie but I got really weird

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,470
like around like Terminator 2 and stuff

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,750
so in summary oh my god I've only got

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,130
five minutes left all right good I don't

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,690
want to hold anyone back on the booze

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,800
that's that's like the bad thing about

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,770
having this slot

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,620
so if I were to tell myself now that my

00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,390
adventure is over I would definitely

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,220
take a more service oriented approach to

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,220
everything right stop thinking about

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,450
individual machines and you have to

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,920
write because you're so salmon so you

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,110
have to actually care about those things

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,970
right but from a top level you should

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,910
kind of just think things as more of a

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,190
service-oriented view right like this

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,170
service provides this service for these

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,540
other services how those services

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,180
interconnect and talk to each other is

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,560
like a big deal that's that's figuring

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,760
out that model is really awesome because

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,080
when you figure that out the hardware

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,560
underneath doesn't matter you just know

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,990
you need more right um and nothing is

00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,640
sacred shoot cattle moat snowflakes like

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,990
you know it was like well you know I've

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,760
put so much time and effort in this

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,990
whole manual way to do things even

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,640
though these people over here figured

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,990
out a way that's totally better I'm

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,080
going to hold on to my thing because I'm

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,780
emotionally attached to it can be very

00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,210
dangerous right um but at the same time

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,740
you don't want to go full hog and

00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,150
chasing everything it's like yeah I want

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,040
this talk and there was this Cooper

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,990
Nettie's thing it's kind of just made

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,450
one point on the summer but I moved our

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,890
entire company to it like you know do

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,960
your due diligence right I'm not saying

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,540
go tear down everything you've built

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,760
right say some rules will always apply

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,260
to the UNIX system right like never

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,490
touch things on a Friday we all know

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,320
this right right so I'm not saying go

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,120
out there and do crazy stuff you should

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,030
definitely be investigating crazy stuff

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,800
though and you should be set up to do

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,490
experiments and fail early and fail

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,350
often right um and steal properties from

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,540
large-scale people and design for

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,650
failure that's like that one actually

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,710
that should probably be my number one

00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,540
thing it was you know go to a talk like

00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,270
velocity you know go talk to a guy who

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,340
works at etsy right large scale stuff

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,410
spotify does like really interesting up

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,500
stuff you guys know that how does it

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:02,670
eibar work right um how does netflix

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,410
work like you do you asking these kind

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,880
of questions and when you go to events

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,620
like this like you should totally be in

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,560
people's faces about it like be like I

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,180
don't understand you just killed that

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,920
what happens here what's a load bounce

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,570
like all sorts of questions you can ask

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,950
from people who are scale and they love

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,110
to talk to you because

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,290
at some point everyone had to start from

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,670
somewhere and I don't think I've ever

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,990
met a Linux person was like no I'm not

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:28,260
going to teach you awesome things see

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,940
you later it could same services are

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,700
much easier to manage than host when you

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,900
think about services as a whole instead

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,730
right you're not constrained by the

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,970
machine anymore that sounds really like

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,510
matrix e so that's just a lot easier to

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,670
manage contain services and bottom line

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,950
efficiency speed enables your users to

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,350
iterate faster right if your company a

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,000
and you compete with company be right

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,410
you all kind of like are high in the

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,210
same developers you make platform

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,610
decisions you you do all these sorts of

00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,460
things right but if I can make these

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,790
guys ten percent faster at iterating

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,920
then these guys they will always win

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:07,650
right the guy who's always accelerating

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,170
will always win unless the race is

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:14,250
really short right and this race is

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,420
never really short is it um so users

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,030
will love you if you make things really

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,650
efficient for them and fast um so here's

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,360
that slide for you students here's what

00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,940
I would usually I would learn if I would

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,810
go back in time um there's certain

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,880
things that are not on this slide

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,410
because they're given right so like

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,640
obviously doctors one of these things

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,480
because you need that for a lot of this

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,730
stuff right um so I really dig how

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,080
Maysles does stuff I think you should

00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,660
definitely investigate that the whole

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,610
kind of data center OS is one big

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,580
scheduler thing is really interesting to

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,410
me I do not know as much about mezzos as

00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,910
I should so that's my personal goal

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,900
because I'm still learning this cycle is

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:53,880
to learn more about mezzos and he's 75

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,040
billion schedulers that you can get for

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,650
them and they're very interesting I've

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,410
mention q bernetti zand and also swarm I

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,210
think it's very interesting apache spark

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,150
is really good if like you haven't

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,020
realized if i was a student and go back

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,730
definitely i would get a minor and like

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,010
either statistics or mathematics or

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,710
something because this area over here is

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,050
exploding IBM by itself is putting 3,500

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,020
developers on spark this year and that's

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:22,170
just one company very interesting big

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:25,140
data stuff happening here and of course

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,020
OpenStack right is kind of like the

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,520
demand there is just really like it's

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,600
been years that I keep going to these

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,029
conferences and very

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,800
be very large companies always looking

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,139
for really experienced people in these

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,069
technologies right it's like a good

00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,410
thing when you go to a conference in

00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,269
every slides like we're hiring let me

00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,800
talk about our HR benefits instead of a

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,910
tech talk because I need you people so

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,490
bad right so if you master any one of

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,560
these things I think I think it'd be set

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,870
up and of course my job I feel is to

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,399
give you all these things so the tool we

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,589
work on call juju is kind of how you

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,420
model all of these things to get that

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,449
stuff either onto your better metal or

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,630
AWS or GCE or Azure how many use using

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:10,649
any of you using any Linux workloads on

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:13,920
azure microsoft windows azure nobody ah

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,720
are you just ashamed box I cuz I am I

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,500
was wondering how that joke was gonna

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,170
pull pull over um so if you want to help

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,660
me in any of these things I'm providing

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,670
we are providing stuff that makes all

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,529
this easier and if you want to share

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:33,389
your code publicly and help build this

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,800
next thing I'll even pay for AWS bill so

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:37,259
what we really want is like this new

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,480
world of like reproducible parts right

00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,610
of Lagos right when you give everyone

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,279
basic legos like they can build really

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,680
cool stuff so art is good I appreciate

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,139
art right there's like something looking

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,579
back I there's something about that

00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,470
system that we design that was really

00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,009
cool right it was unique and everything

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,540
I can appreciate art right and that's

00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:59,250
really good i think art is great we

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,980
should celebrate art but that's not what

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,449
we do we're infrastructure people right

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,520
fundamentally whether you like it or not

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,890
linux is an infrastructure thing it's

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,130
like the concrete that makes the modern

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,140
world like like live so art is really

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,150
cool we should appreciate art but the

00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,709
ability to do and there's they're

00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:20,159
obviously containers here there's like a

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,780
get it like right you know right and

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:23,100
then the crane the crane is like uber

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,959
Nettie's i'm like juju is like the guy

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,449
like driving it it's like i got it all

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,860
figured out so yeah so we're

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,210
infrastructure people so why aren't is

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,890
really cool your ability to make

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,480
something reproducible something

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,380
observable something that's easily to

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,720
debug that you're sharing you know

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,730
across a large swath of ppl makes things

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,290
really really possible so i was just in

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,220
washington DC and I saw the Space

00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,809
Shuttle like they had

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,309
it's a lot bigger than you think right

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,230
because when they put on the rocket

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:51,840
looks really small right and i SAT there

00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,450
and I looked up I underneath and looked

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,220
at all how complex that thing was just

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,780
the fact that it worked we put a dude on

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,990
the moon think about that for a second

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,309
right cuz like we lose that kind of

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,200
grand scale where it's like okay I'll go

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,580
in my car you know I hit a sorry I get

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,710
music through the internet Ryan oh

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,940
that's the India pairs and here's cool

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,980
mobile things I'm doing right and then

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,419
we kind of tend to forget it was in the

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,750
shadow the Space Shuttle I was looking

00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:18,150
out and I was like man like think of

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,610
what we accomplished with technology

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,200
back then right think about all the

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,330
technology that we're using to like make

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,490
smart phones and stuff cool think about

00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,490
if we were to use that to like actually

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,110
go to Mars or Saturn or something I feel

00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,460
we're really behind in like arthur c

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,740
clarke timeline so sorry i talked so

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,720
long my wife my wife tells me i talk too

00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,070
fast i'm trying to trying to not be that

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,140
spaz guy does anyone have any questions

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,669
or comments anyone's like no you're

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,990
wrong anything i don't want to keep

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,990
anyone from the booze yes sir

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,620
sure so the question was as a student

00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:04,500
how much should I spend an AWS on the

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,380
cloud so first of all I feel especially

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,280
having worked in education that the

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,260
accessibility of that stuff's a student

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,780
should be like a paramount thing right

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,049
like I would feel if I was a staff at a

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,309
at a university and my students had to

00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,230
pay out of pocket to get computing

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:22,980
resources that i would like really think

00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:26,210
that sucks so but there's there's

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,380
definitely tons of ways that you can use

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,919
these tools without paying a lot of

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,330
money right like like with us if you

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,919
know if you're committing open source

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,570
code or whatever and you're helping the

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,330
community nine times out of ten we

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,320
usually just like pay for your bill like

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,820
if you're if you're doing cool stuff

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,260
right AWS is like a developer program

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,730
google has a course historically always

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,740
been very supportive of open source

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,120
developers so if you're like involved

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,640
with like a project doing something

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,530
awesome right these companies recognize

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,870
that value right there like there's a

00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,429
reason that like Amazon gives Debian

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,799
developers AWS money you know what I'm

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:03,600
saying because fundamentally those those

00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,559
companies kind of depend on the stuff

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,100
that we eventually all built right um so

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,540
I I wouldn't say like hey only spend $25

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,740
you know a month I wouldn't say anything

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,390
like that timewise obviously you know

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,610
issues take care of your grades but the

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,590
way I went through school is I spent way

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:27,330
too much time cuz quake had just come

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,559
out and and remember quake world when

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,570
the networking happened that's when it

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,010
got cool right like quake by itself is

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,179
really awesome and we did that already I

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,220
did do my almost fall in high school

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,690
because of doom right but when quick

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,220
world happened right that network effect

00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,429
was really like the thing that made it

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,710
made it cool so I don't play video games

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,600
just like learn stuff like if I were to

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,549
go back I always think with my friends

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,080
who are like they they teach it like

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,190
community colleges and stuff on the side

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,380
it's like man we should make a new

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,020
university we're like your freshman year

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,340
you'd like we teach you how to learn get

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,480
and then we don't teach you laying and

00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,010
we forced you to learn different

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,840
languages every year and like we have

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,450
all these crazy amazing dreams on how

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,120
how we should like foster the next

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:10,750
generation

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:14,350
of developers um but no I mean it's God

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:17,470
I don't want to sound like a like a

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,990
sound bite but when I went to school you

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,700
had to pay for a compiler like you had

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,740
to pay for a compiler and it was not

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,060
cheap right now we have to really

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,970
awesome compilers i'm going to say which

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,580
one is the best one um right it's really

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,140
interesting right you can d you don't

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,760
just have a kernel you have like an

00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,710
entire mobile operating system that you

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,870
can like mess with right multiple ones

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,710
right whether that's Android or blue to

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,710
touch or jolla what a red print yalla

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:48,520
thank you firefox i like multiple phone

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:50,410
things right um so it's a it's just very

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,540
interesting like but like literally

00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,160
there's nothing stopping anybody from

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,720
learning all these things other than

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,420
like personal motivation whereas before

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,250
it was like I actually had to walk to a

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,590
computer lab so I can get to a terminal

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,850
to do stuff right and it was like well

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,260
it's two in the morning no one's going

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,530
to be using the Solaris system that I

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,610
got to do my stuff right now now these

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,250
days you can do all this stuff from a

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,510
phone it's like crazy so you know all

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,600
your young people in the audience like

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,450
you have an amazing opportunity to shape

00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,490
the power world operates and I think

00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,870
that's really awesome so I highly

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,080
encourage you to be the next person that

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,580
builds like Facebook or something and

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,860
just don't work for that don't work for

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,860
the NSA though no just kidding am I

00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:47,049
ability to be secure sure so the

00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:49,239
question is is you work at a hospital

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,649
and they're very hesitant to put things

00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,789
in the public cloud in this case right

00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:54,429
because when we say cloud that can also

00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:58,450
be your internal systems they're

00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:00,100
definitely a lot of risk there right you

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,080
don't control the hardware you don't

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,179
even control the hypervisor like there

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,289
could be a dude at pep club rider on the

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:09,249
other end just looking at your

00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:10,809
proprietary stuff right I don't really

00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:13,059
have like an answer for that other than

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,989
if you really care about that sort of

00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,169
thing you would run it on your own

00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:19,059
hardware I think but the properties that

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:22,779
make the public cloud so compelling

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:24,159
replicating those for yourself is what I

00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:25,389
would recommend there I don't think

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,519
anyone's ever going to have like build a

00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:29,769
totally secure thing there's always

00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,269
going to be risks right the question is

00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:33,070
like am I in the same boat as everyone

00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:38,109
else as long as it's not the Titanic I'm

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:40,289
okay right so any other questions yes

00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,289
sir

00:23:49,610 --> 00:24:02,760
yep like me not right right and house

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,080
stuff with like hippo or whatever yeah

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,170
so yeah no more quick no one's gonna

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:19,230
make fun of me for unity or anything or

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:20,640
that was like my fault okay fine I I I

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,290
admit to showing mark shuttleworth

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,580
genome do when i first started and it

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,320
was one of the first things to do like

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:30,090
super key type and then it gives you

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,160
magically stuff um but yeah I was kind

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,320
of working on that stuff is is really

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,560
interesting forgot the lead developers

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,790
name but the idea was very super tight

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,350
get what you want it's really awesome

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,000
and I everyone else stole it from this

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,140
cuz everyone loves it right you love the

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,840
Amazon lens you looked like the kind of

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:51,380
guy who loves the Amazon lens yeah it's

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,780
really good yes sir amazon web services

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,310
that's a good question someone actually

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,590
pass with something Sam for so AWS cents

00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,820
for amazon web services which is a whole

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,840
suite of things you'd be surprised

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,940
what's in there but it started off as

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,160
just you got compute which they call ec2

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,050
you got storage which was us three right

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,210
so if you think of the parts of your

00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,010
computer that you need to do stuff this

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,840
is something that they offer so now you

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,760
can get like elastic MapReduce you can

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,610
they have a transcode service now I

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,930
think and like a lot of when it started

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,160
out they call that infrastructure as a

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,750
service right which is cloud

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,330
infrastructure as a service but over

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,270
time if they become more platform as a

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:31,050
service which is pads right I don't want

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:32,730
to oh god too late so like I've noticed

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,350
that a lot of infrastructure as is what

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,980
we now call infrastructure as a service

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:40,530
is very paz e right I mean it provides a

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:46,320
lot more things than just raw compute

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:47,820
and things like that so yeah yes so when

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,290
as your first came out it came out as a

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,240
path and then they kind of retooled it

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,530
to make it more infrastructure as a

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,790
service but there's a lot of great

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,260
passes out there actually a lot of

00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,090
people remember the first time you saw

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,840
how Heroku work who's who's here is use

00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,549
Heroku your

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,809
I don't have to care about the stuff in

00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,980
the back end there's just Dino things

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,320
and they're all named after mechs and

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,029
stuff it's like really cool but there

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,200
are lot of great passes out there that

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:09,210
you could use if you want to even

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,789
abstract yourself even more things like

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:15,659
open shift is pretty cool there's like

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:17,039
50 billion docker passes out there and I

00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:19,049
haven't played with each one I really

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,570
need to do that so if you kind of want a

00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,309
more abstract thing that's a little bit

00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,100
more Heroku like and you want to look

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:28,100
look at it pass yes sir

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,170
oh absolutely absolutely in fact you can

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,630
do it you can do a lot of this stuff

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,240
locally using things like vagrant there

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,580
was a recession on vagrant we use a lot

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,220
of Linux containers economical Lexi and

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,690
LexA d and obviously like the whole

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,220
point of dockers to have that kind of

00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,110
this is what it would look like in the

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,610
real life for your applications right

00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:59,830
where's Lexi Lexi or more like

00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:01,510
lightweight VMs lightweight games so you

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,700
could definitely play a lot of that

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,490
stuff on localhost like on your laptop

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,810
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,390
like four or five banana pot or

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,680
raspberry pi tues and a switch and then

00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,990
bam bam bam and then I'm going to deploy

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,470
OpenStack on them and do all sorts of

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:20,590
crazy things yes that's a thing like I

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,730
think we've deployed at seeing real hard

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,010
cuz we have an OpenStack lab we've

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,810
deployed OpenStack I think 11,000 times

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,910
the cycle so I'm pretty sure it works if

00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,250
you try it you try blew up a stack I

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,830
hope it works for you it will I'm

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,870
confident I'm confident we'll any other

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,610
questions or comments anyone not

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,770
understand the Star Trek jokes that was

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,110
kind of like a concern to me see I

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,280
gnu/linux people wouldn't let me down

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,200
okay so thank you very much for coming

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,040
i'm around all day thank you so much for

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,040
having me I appreciate it

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:53,750
so I hope you learned something and

00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,090
please go forth try this stuff build the

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:58,820
next something awesome so I can retire
