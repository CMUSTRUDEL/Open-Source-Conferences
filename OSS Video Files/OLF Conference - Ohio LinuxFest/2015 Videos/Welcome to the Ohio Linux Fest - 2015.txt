	Jon “maddog” Hall, President of Linux International and Chairman of the Board of Linux Professional Institute (LPI) invites you to the  Ohio LinuxFest (ohiolinux.org) on Oct 2nd and 3rd, 2015 in Columbus, Ohio

This is a Free and Open Source Software and Hardware community conference, run by an all-volunteer staff for the past thirteen years.

LPI is cooperating with Ohio Linux Fest to help people obtain high quality training and certifications via the Ohio LinuxFest  Institute (OLFI) professional training day on October 2nd.

A fifty dollar discount off the 450 price will be given for each LPI training course you take.

In addition, *every* OLF attendee to the main conference (free if you register early at their web site) gets a discount voucher good for 90 days in taking an LPI certification – you can actually save money by coming to a free conference!

Curious about Free Software and how it can help your business or school? Never had a chance to try it out?  You will find the people at OLF very friendly and helpful.

Old GNU/Linux friend or new, come and bring two Microsoft users with you.
