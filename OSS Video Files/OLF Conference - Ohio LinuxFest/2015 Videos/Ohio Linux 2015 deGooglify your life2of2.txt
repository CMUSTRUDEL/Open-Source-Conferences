	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770
can run into interesting issues with the

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,349
way they count people as attending if it

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,420
doesn't send out clearly there is some

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,900
incompatibility between some clients i

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,920
found that don't always reliably do it

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:24,660
even if you're using a third-party

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:31,890
client that isn't gmail no questions

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:37,910
okay i use freebsd as my primary server

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:43,140
actually frenos would work just fine um

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,570
just uh the apps allure shouldn't really

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,719
be any problems with it and if you

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,600
Father AIX people's but yeah green

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,890
answers are solid so how do you tackle

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,750
because one thing that I'm always

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,489
worried about running these services in

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,930
my I'm worried about how I done the

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,270
security company yeah sure you going to

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,970
that is there any shorter question

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:15,090
France the other just cuz that's more

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:19,860
involved in I can do demo I believe

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,259
there are plugins of course there's the

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,159
question of do you want to be doing your

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,659
GP g in a web browser and with a foreign

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,180
computer that you really can't control

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,650
looking at it if you're concerned enough

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,750
about encryption maybe it should be your

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,860
own device if you're doing that so I

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,259
haven't looked to do it myself because

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,140
that's my personal view but I believe

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,340
there are plugins that all you do it and

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,020
I'm aware there's some work that's been

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,509
working on to get some gpg JavaScript so

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,040
pages for believe even Google was

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,700
looking because they want to look better

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,420
and privacy at least while still

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,420
harvesting your data

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,700
yes that is the fundamental problem with

00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,490
the third party doctrine is the unix

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,780
servers are basically all set up not to

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,190
keep things encrypted on the hard drive

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,550
it's hard to back them up properly

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,970
incremental backup is pretty much break

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:21,070
if you have to trust your route if you

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,320
don't trust your head man you're stuck

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,580
on most of them you could figure out

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,720
some way to do with encryption but it's

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:41,130
backwards to the way things were set up

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:46,120
originally so it's hard from an ICS file

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:52,450
the web interface a lot of you don't

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:55,570
wreck I'm not entirely sure I guess it

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,459
does although I I'm not entirely pleased

00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,830
with the shell rip so I rarely use it I

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,040
use it actually as Cal dev back in

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:09,489
myself but I don't usually interface

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:12,790
with this part i use the evolution

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,410
client gnome or my phone because it

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:20,170
takes them both and i'm usually looking

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:22,390
like emails on those anyway sure i don't

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,980
see an obvious way but that doesn't mean

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,310
there's Anna drag-and-drop written under

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,310
here somewhere

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,980
yes this is a demo instance that is not

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,629
my real instance that I put on the local

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:49,079
machine and I have no network connection

00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:54,870
here for my real I have HTTPS Everywhere

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:58,829
I require TLS 1.2 and every website I

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:02,370
host redirects to the HTTPS version I

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,280
don't run unencrypted it anymore because

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,889
it's not hard to set up so you might as

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,840
well at least it hides it provides more

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:16,979
traffic that hides the guys that

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:23,970
actually need to be hidden I use at the

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:25,889
moment I am using the start ssl as free

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,810
issue of keys but you have to pay to

00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,000
revoke so if you don't screw up you

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,139
don't have to pay but if you screw up

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,580
you did I intend to probably move to

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,760
let's encrypt once that comes up

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:41,010
supposed to count this quarter but yes I

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,710
use real certificates everywhere I sign

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:48,930
my emails with SS SME rather than PGP

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,060
because that key signing thing is still

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,710
a pain in the month and not a lot of

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,120
people have them and it's hard to make

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,430
sure your network is broad enough that

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,500
everyone works so for the moment we're

00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,789
stopped trusting the CAS even though

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,909
they are point of failure the

00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:06,380
government's have abused but basically

00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,380
we're we're stuck at for a practicality

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:16,039
all right so keys

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:20,090
and how to secure them so it's how big

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,710
of a threat are you perceiving I'm not I

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,120
feel like if the government's going to

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,919
target me directly then there's no

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,860
communication so I read about routine

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,569
surveillance and striptease okay for

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,569
routine surveillance and script kiddies

00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,960
there's options first I'll mention if

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,970
you're looking at high grade stuff you

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
can buy hardware security appliances

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,470
that keep the keys on them and expect

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,410
except for a vulnerability it was in one

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,840
version recently the keys can't get off

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,889
and can't be exposed so they keep you

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,070
from screwing up if you have employees

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:59,389
good but they're expensive so for most

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:02,770
people I have a question so you can go

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:06,099
with a number of different approaches

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,900
the easiest one is probably just to

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:12,409
generate a key signing request take it

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,970
to your ca get get the certain and the

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:19,099
key and unless you want to have to type

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,020
in the password on reboot which i think

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:23,360
is probably a bit much for a home

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,150
installation I just leave the key

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,250
unencrypted in a directory where you've

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:37,520
set the permissions for root read and

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:41,300
nothing else since openssl lopor require

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,979
to work anyway so the ssl parts because

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,110
you're less than 1024 you need the route

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,110
to open the port in the first place so

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,060
if we'll have the permission street

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,840
accessible home lang

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,520
but just setting the permissions for the

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,010
low-grade certificates for like hosting

00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,160
your own is probably okay for home

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,280
instances i would go with an encrypted

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,860
to me that if you're looking for a bit

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,419
more security an encrypted key that you

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,180
have to type in while you reboot of

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,220
course that only protect you from data

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,000
at rest once it's loaded into ram you

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:18,000
have other problems that are hard to get

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:29,200
I did until the browser started

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,650
implementing complaining too much and

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,810
using given that start SSL open so has

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,330
those free keys I just did a three page

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,060
because it's not that much effort and

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,040
it's more effort to click the I accept

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,540
this problem button then you get the key

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,880
installed if you're going to go there on

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,460
a regular basis otherwise yeah go ahead

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,350
but with let's encrypt that's the whole

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,600
idea is to remove self science from

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,510
pretty much service it's basically going

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,460
to be a replacement for self signs but

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,560
where you're not looking to get real

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,990
authentication beyond this person owns

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,990
or at least this access to the DNS

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,990
records

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:31,120
anyone else I'm generally just do a mean

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,300
what i do is i have evolution is my

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,130
primary client i use i don't bother if

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,620
it's from my phone I don't really trust

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,650
it entirely anyway so I don't keep my

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,870
circus on my phone so if it's from my

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,210
phone it's not sign if it's from my

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:50,230
laptop or desktop i trust those enough

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:54,250
to have my I event a certain for my

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:56,650
email address from the CA and I sign it

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,820
automatically going out at least if they

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:08,410
have evolution to get the nice creamy

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:10,720
box so oman dns ya es second is the way

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,830
to go but no one's really supporting it

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:22,660
yet and i'm really pleased with my new

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:25,510
dns with my ex provider there it kind of

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,130
depends on what your goal is i have

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,010
actually thought the mail server on

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,520
arabia's i deployed d cabinet

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:35,640
yeah it's nice to have just because it's

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,920
it's an extra tool that's there but it's

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,720
generally not i found that generally

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,130
doesn't help you from your mail getting

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,590
like this spam it doesn't help other

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,350
mail servers trust you more it's just

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,730
kind of a tool for your own to prevent

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,660
people from impersonating your mail

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:54,270
server yeah oh that part now yes so it's

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,530
helpful but it depends on what you're

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,210
trying to accomplish if you're trying to

00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,130
accomplish I want my vow to go career

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,360
way not be marked as spam it tends to

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:07,760
not help SPF though I was definitely

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,050
yeah business implement them personal

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,690
because basically what you're trying to

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,670
do is stay with envy where you have that

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,800
reasonable expectation of privacy wall

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,250
and it would require reasonable

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,750
suspicion just like searching your house

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,030
you want at least that level when you're

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,800
dealing with the government because

00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:30,240
despite what anyone says about privacy

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:33,570
you have a natural law basis for arguing

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,840
on privacy humans keep secrets what we

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,280
do other animals keep secrets so the

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,060
founding fathers would have seen that as

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,280
one of those self-evident natural rights

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,890
that would fall under be not enumerated

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,790
but would be quite reasonable for you to

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:53,340
have so under our system of law those

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,090
should be protected whether or not they

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,830
actually are being they would reasonably

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,260
be at least as the natural law

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,310
philosopher would look at it what you

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,310
have a right to do

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,000
maybe maybe maybe maybe but at least in

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,830
terms of the natural law philosophy the

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,480
Constitution was written on the basis of

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,580
but which is not actually one of the

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,620
more common philosophies anymore it

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,060
would fall under that but it is the

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:32,820
philosophy that's the basis of our law

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:36,090
lock in principles avianna all right

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,090
