provisioning PM petitioning and great

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,580
advantage to parish and the vibrancy

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,580
block

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,530
I

00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,440
so we're kind of break this up into like

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,540
three parts so part one will actually

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,390
talk just about the Foreman project

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:58,620
we'll get an overview of what it is and

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,620
why it's a really cool tool

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,790
and then sort of a part three it's only

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,200
one slide but we'll kind of explain how

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,700
you can bring the two projects together

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,340
or how they're actually brought together

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,330
you can automate everything from top to

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,070
bottom your infrastructure also talked

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,070
about some other awesome things that

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,680
all right so on what is forming Foreman

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,840
is an open-source project that helps

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,150
administrators manage servers through

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,950
the lifecycle proficiency bare-metal

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,769
server provisioning on the AWS who

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,190
Google compute matching configuration of

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,290
those servers once their provisions and

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,060
integration with Chef salt for current

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,140
provisioning to losers even integration

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,819
with the ansible for inventory and a

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,400
good it's a good way to separate

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:38,940
configuration by environment or by role

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:41,849
with D permissions in the integration so

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,349
I use it personally for provisioning

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,000
very vital servers that's how we got

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,410
started that with the company I was

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,790
total 50 servers we're gonna ride my

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,769
data center I need to get him online in

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,299
few days so it was highly motivated not

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,000
to mount I said on to every single one

00:03:51,299 --> 00:04:00,000
of them go through these into s-76

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,750
installation process so it's talking to

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,510
us and told me about forming an online

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,850
and found a way to set it up so when new

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:14,510
servers arrive with my datacenter didn't

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,510
power network that turned out completely

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,790
I should this my boss and he was pretty

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,710
depressed too so now I didn't really

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,840
care at the time about configuration and

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,730
their company or location all the extra

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,620
stuff that it can do because I was the

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,640
only one using it but now it's supposed

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,650
to be public into the rest of the

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,460
company and the other measures the

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,960
Oracle people do people all of them are

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,580
gonna be up in the system so now I need

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,190
to make sure they can't touch my servers

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,740
so I'm really pleased by the ability to

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,670
do class separation and configuration /

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,680
puppet integration so when the server

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,970
comes online the initial configuration I

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,150
have done it's all done for puppet

00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:01,010
immediately I saw another that audits

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,800
all changes that ever happens if I have

00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,800
something it goes in to make a change

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,790
and change the track so public changes -

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,010
so somebody doesn't go into the Etsy

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,260
puppet modules directory and edit a file

00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,940
they go to the UI and there's an

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,230
inheritance structure built in so I can

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,020
say there's global inheritance where

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,790
these say pseudo I want all items that

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,770
have pseudo and then bubble down to

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,350
Oracle servers Oracle admins can also

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,300
have a pseudo this command you know I'm

00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:37,640
doing the Heritage trees or puppet 3d

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,560
web UI and I can see I really specifying

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,300
the permissions and see every change

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,200
that this Oracle heavens might do with

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,200
their student submissions

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,480
there's also a really awesome recipe

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,250
yeah so anything can be with a console

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,680
you can do the REST API sitting together

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,020
in over scripts there's a command-line

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,730
utility pop hammer if you add dash dash

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,410
debug to the hammer commands it will

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:04,030
show you the glass API calls that it's

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:05,950
doing to excuse commands and there's a

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,240
full dashboard system for all public

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,580
configuration where I'll tell you

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,960
systems that are out of compliance

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,000
there's also a definite system for the

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,760
package management system for tracking

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,760
errata what's non-compliance there's a

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,600
security auditing module make sure that

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,600
their experience

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,440
and so my favorite part of this for me

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,410
is hogging every level so a new server

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,940
comes in but then itself up there's a

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,280
plugin called hook script so I didn't

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,020
say after it stood up in qualifying on

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,850
script to talk with hot area API which

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,630
piece I'm going to do and it'll register

00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,630
itself as a day to do

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,369
it takes about three hours because I'm

00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:03,219
in it

00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:05,110
formatting about well 808 terabyte this

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,960
and that takes a while but if they would

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,580
have guessed it would be done in just

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,860
that this video demo of me provisioning

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,089
a virtual machine as if it was a device

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,639
from V Creighton the end and it's DC I

00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:24,159
discovered push the growth approach to

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,930
it through Foreman and the way bare

00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,759
metal provisioning works if you don't

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,110
have pre rule set so I don't want

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,509
entities to get pushing that's hers that

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,270
mark data in right or servers that

00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:36,580
already has notes on it so I have rules

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,259
out detect puppet facts from a thin

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,419
image that loads up initially

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,159
so I detect harvard long ago i detect

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,219
whether something's ass element or not

00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:47,229
and if it meets those rules in auto

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:50,110
collision if not it'll sit in a register

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,849
glistening state it's ghost without

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,779
installing anything and click on

00:07:51,849 --> 00:08:03,219
configure now we have full control of

00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:06,520
what's getting what's not it so the

00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,169
provisioning is really powerful for a

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,009
bare metal but also it can talk to a

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:14,259
number of cloud systems and hypervisor

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,269
type system so it's deep VMware

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,589
integration I can tighten my VMware

00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,269
server errors at the computer resource

00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:20,740
and instead of me going in Graydon VM

00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,719
from here I could say give me ten more

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,149
begins give me ten local servers

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:28,149
it'll going to get to be spear create

00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:31,709
the beams installed work along and will

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:36,699
be online the same is true for OpenStack

00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:39,089
dude types of ec2 I haven't messed with

00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,089
over

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,680
we also support stalkers computer source

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,840
which is one of you one note about the

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,310
integration if you delete the server

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:22,720
from here it will delete it now the

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,720
VMware we found that out two weeks ago

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,580
another benefit of the architecture is

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,500
they have something called smart proxies

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,730
these are geographically independent

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,960
servers that will talk back to your name

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,450
form a server that is near all repos so

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,890
we have one HD graphics item all the

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,660
packages we need to push it over our

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,240
network narrowed over and when things

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,980
either install or update they pull from

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,570
that local local server instead of going

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,810
across the land it does also mention of

00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,740
DHCP DNS TCP is how it pushes out images

00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:03,080
for pixie using tftpd there's a nice UI

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,750
you can install to manage DHCP if you

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,360
want to I can also talk to Microsoft

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,490
DHCP servers as an interim so we already

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,520
had some Microsoft DHCP servers so I

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,050
have to do a pasture for HP and EMS for

00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,050
my mine servers they can get in

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,050
only one note about security said the

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,120
way stuff gets registered at the puppet

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,250
its orchestrated by Foreman so it'll

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,770
install certificates when it registers

00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,150
so the only way something can talk to

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,130
the foreman server is if it's got its

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,720
certificate already authenticated that's

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,700
pretty much do it so it's not like

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,350
anything can just log in and start

00:10:50,700 --> 00:11:00,270
pulling all your public editor of them

00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:02,160
on this down configuration so this

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:06,450
system configuration management the one

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,710
that's built in is puppet I initially

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,570
wanted to use the ansible more because I

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,650
was familiar with it but since it's got

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,470
more of a puppet yeah the benefit is

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:19,140
there's a ton of modules for puppet it's

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,450
easy during my whole class inheritance

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,010
structure is really nice and the other

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,360
system administrators I work with are

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,680
you aware of it so it was easy

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,230
onboarding context to it

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,510
there's also native salt integration

00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,960
that can install where this as deep

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,520
integrations puppet the ansible

00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,050
integration isn't a beacon

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,960
it's we can use this as an inventory and

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,440
pull backs from it but I used to ask one

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,240
more for ad hoc stuff anyway it's not a

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,150
second to say hey give me all these data

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,130
names and it's all such a package or

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,610
change one config option without having

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,330
Profoto the public figuration

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,330
configuration is nice to have to

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:15,510
so it's it's already preinstalled I mean

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,400
when I mentioned it something will sit

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,170
in the listening state if it's not

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,850
doesn't have provision girls listen what

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,400
it will do is look at sentence seventh

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,700
in image with puppet themself over over

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,910
TFTP and it'll push all of its facts

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,200
about the host and Foreman so that's how

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,400
it knows what your model is it is

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
everything about that piece of hardware

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,760
that puppet would know about and you can

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,620
click and your discover codes when they

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,620
review those facts and use that to make

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:52,020
decisions like I have rules based on

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:54,600
Beale and it comes up so the way you

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,680
control which OS is installed which

00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,410
puppet server it registers with and even

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,810
access control and puppet configurations

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,930
dumpsters Nicole host groups host groups

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:10,470
can be subgroups of other host groups so

00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,550
you can do multiple inheritance you can

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,350
have a host group be assigned

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,050
automatically with the discovery rules

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,200
for bare-metal provisioning if you're

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:21,210
using if you're not pulling into pushing

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,310
ok you're talking to being where RAC to

00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,920
you can have that be predetermined by

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,120
host groups as well so weird you choose

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,230
your host with ahead of time you push

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,760
and that's how this what's do and then

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,400
there's ability that you use to assign

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,650
activation keys within the host group so

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,060
an activation key comes comes in later

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,580
when we talk about package management

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,200
and content host that's how all your

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,640
repositories are managed which package

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,500
you want to sign we're in our cycle

00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,390
management and that's more of the

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,840
katella piece so that's where it Foreman

00:13:48,390 --> 00:14:00,420
and

00:13:48,840 --> 00:14:07,820
start to come together getting it

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:07,820
registered with the classes resources I

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,560
mentioned Commissioner Lee that you can

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,940
see all your pup information on court on

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,870
a front dashboard seeing which those are

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,910
in compliance there's pretty graphs

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,370
it'll give you a history of all changes

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,740
for her host if you want oh there is one

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,660
thing you will probably do I had set the

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,480
pran TAS that rather were 30 days to

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:37,620
clear out old public reports because if

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:39,030
you don't do that ties into LDAP

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,190
authentication Suites Active Directory

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,960
then just have a be group set up for

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,700
each of each of environment and that's

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,280
how people get added I don't have to

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,660
worry about adding users that's when

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,790
they get hired they're putting their ad

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,390
groups into our handles all that and all

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,390
their accesses

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,180
which I think it's really important

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,910
because I mean just last week we had one

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,910
of our admins go and configuration that

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:37,410
she had one of our developers routine

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:38,790
almost author servers and so we

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,950
mentioned some our proxies

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,380
here's kind of good over overview of the

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,430
architecture smart proxies manage things

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,590
like DNS DHCP local package management

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,120
each one's a puppet CA but it's a

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,540
transparent puppets it'll mirror the

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,310
performance server and local news will

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,340
hide likely talk to that level of this

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,630
evening and that's even nicely if you

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,820
were to lose communication between data

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,310
centers if you still have your public

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,900
say there you could technically log

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,900
again and yourself

00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:33,790
so I use proxmox for some of my because

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,580
it's pretty cool so here's me just

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,560
creating a VM I would not normally use

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,330
this to do theater management this is

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,800
simulating an experimental server

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,560
because I'd much rather to use its

00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,500
compute in addition so this is just a

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,590
new server coming online in my a big

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,510
deal and I said but discover rules to

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,150
apply a host group provision to it to

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,730
give it a 5 gig partition home directory

00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,550
and to sell us an updated so you're

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:07,720
going to see that happen live fresh

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:10,260
server cuz I didn't believe it till I

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,260
saw there

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,709
the foreman discovery it's the image

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,880
facade over DHCP I talked about then the

00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,049
medicating loaded so that's happening

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,730
right now to sit 207 been image search

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,160
to discover all the fats pushing the

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,780
informant and we'll see those facts and

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,270
make a decision push it back to the pen

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,419
and you'll see it reboot again receive a

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:48,350
new image and start the song it was

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:49,880
pretty quick it came to really quick

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,790
visit each data center you have your

00:17:49,880 --> 00:18:01,970
smart proxy I have my sent to us

00:17:51,790 --> 00:18:04,030
installation files so in each one the

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,370
plugin that lets me do this auto

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:10,929
provisioning is called form discovery

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,929
pretty easy to install some commands

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,350
now if you don't want to do

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,090
auto-discovery if you want to go and

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,890
manually put in a MAC address and that

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,750
bit then you don't need to plug in but

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,299
my whole driver was to not have to do

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,840
the MAC address thing they have a

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:34,490
provisioning system already but it

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:43,000
required me to go in and it was

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:43,000
kick-started Oh

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:54,520
network configuration so you can use

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:54,520
DHCP which is easy but I can do

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,310
and that's all discovery rules to be set

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:33,900
of lists of facts equals whatever and

00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:42,000
then in this case it's based on model of

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:44,520
the hardware so I and so what about the

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,530
systems that you already had powered up

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,060
it's a do I discover those without so I

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,380
didn't really I think there's implying

00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,790
into that but I didn't want it to auto

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,920
discover those so we're doing this at

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,450
stages to have something Auto register

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:03,840
and you can just change it to puppet

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:06,240
server to the foreman server and it'll

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:14,970
register in the puppet it will wait for

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:16,790
a certificate signed certificate all its

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,170
inventory information to perform

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,800
we're doing a bit of a migration process

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,360
with satellite six because we were using

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,880
just a normal puppet across the company

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,450
without my support before so we're

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
trying to light it

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:38,360
we are a migrating that into the

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:38,360
environment that's why

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,840
updated all of the other servers that

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:51,000
were migrated it's a more servers right

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,000
for about three hours until she got

00:20:51,480 --> 00:21:03,570
really upset she went around a repo

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:03,570
system you have to do a merger plus I

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:33,309
just went around back it was you just

00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:36,670
mentioned migration south at six is

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,770
formal so tell it six is forming in

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,360
Katella combined so I already deployed

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,000
it as like an appliance on my network

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,780
for you anyway put it was doing so

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,160
another administrator is I'm really busy

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:53,160
deployment once he knows

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:13,370
so is there is there any advantage to

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:20,120
usually the main advantage is that is

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:22,400
free you can afford satellite six

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,780
totally get it instead then you have

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,150
full support and there's even an extra

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,740
plug in that they'll push metrics from

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,240
your nodes if you want them to and to

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,270
write I'll tell you about the help your

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,409
servers with analytics and stuff that's

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:55,520
pretty cool and they have something

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:57,679
great chance might you can call that's

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,500
another good point so the Red Hat repo

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,190
management you can hook in your head

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,530
east to Foreman Katella if you do it

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,720
might jack up your licensing for that if

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,880
we had the satellite six license hook

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,159
into manage already post and that same

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,530
woman decided she was going to go in and

00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,090
register the keys for Red Hat and assign

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,520
all licenses on to our form and server

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,230
it took us about three weeks to get all

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,380
the keys time right exercise it the

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,039
right way so it's literally the same

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,900
kids to this you can't assign you can't

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,900
hook it up to Red Hat without a license

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,350
key for satellite so it can mess up

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,350
utilizes

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:47,000
it's use for building out exactly one

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:56,029
server so is there a way to handle

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:57,890
things and it's injected into puppet

00:23:56,029 --> 00:24:01,340
dynamically through long they call it a

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,820
node there's something new classifier

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,190
right

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,740
so all those I people as I told you

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,600
about forming will inject all that

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,070
second than in classifier and then right

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,399
we're sure what's taking in some

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,260
database so you guys there is the way

00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:19,399
they injected as facts and then in the

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:23,179
class browser and puppet explain Ruby

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:24,799
ArrayList I can override so like I have

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,610
my NTP servers all injected in

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,610
configuration for that

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:45,820
a new classifier thing is really cool

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,010
like I can hit so if I'm having an issue

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,380
with like a kickstart I can hitch a side

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,820
of dynamically dinner the kickstart my

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,950
static page for me to look at what was

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,240
happening so I can troubleshoot because

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,650
there's like five different pieces that

00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,650
kinda generated the kicks in the file

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:18,220
forming server having the classifier

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:20,590
passing editing tell me all right based

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,880
off the rules I said so if the system

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,380
comes up and it doesn't meet the rules

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,860
for free provisioning which one of the

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,300
rules is no it less it'll just it should

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,610
put off its disk and never hit the

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,550
network hard to put up or if it's

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,800
somehow like this fails it's the net to

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,840
boot up able to sit no I believe

00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,010
listening state that has a discovered

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,580
house informant if it's not already

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,240
registered

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,240
it's very Russian informant

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,090
so for my servers I'm you Supermicro us

00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,049
there's a IP life and fitting my tool

00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,820
it's awesome

00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:58,490
so I'll wait till either lessons install

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:04,919
just really captured my config tool use

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:11,549
it all use ansible to do commands but I

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:14,220
could probably use puppets so as you can

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:17,730
see our host is fully all behind the

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,350
host name you can set patterns based so

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:24,330
that's a little bit of a challenge so I

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,380
do patterns they stop the dress just

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,299
because I'm trying to keep track of

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,760
where my nodes are so the rack name in

00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:32,669
there is why I bring 50 servers on the

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,870
line I don't it's part when otto

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,890
kreutzman happenings i don't really know

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,159
where they are cuz we're all on the same

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,159
VLAN

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,170
Oh

00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:18,220
somebody just showed for like how you

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,040
would do it there's a little bit of

00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,110
interaction there touching the server

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,040
eternity that's not a lot of interaction

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:33,549
Foreman does support what's called

00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:39,929
unattended installation where so

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:42,040
basically okay in the future open ship

00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:44,410
so basically unattended installation

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,929
meaning that I can log into the Foreman

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,929
and say I want to add it up

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:56,559
I selected VMware I can assign it the

00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,410
resources from there and it will

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,410
automatically create the VM inside

00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:16,529
be very careful because if you deleted

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:23,779
here you're going to turn them actually

00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:23,779
handle bring up the actual VM inside

00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:28,110
also yeah they can tell Oh documentation

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,419
it's really horrible

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:33,470
if you have a red head account I highly

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,470
recommend using the Red Hat

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:08,200
oh I'm what the guy at work was saying

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,230
he's got more to the be more stuff you

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,210
can do you don't have to use like the

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:16,740
root account VMware you can do like

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:19,510
Lauren count per environment so that

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:22,090
each I think you can do a per area to

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,380
per like class to about with people that

00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,299
shouldn't be credit medium some user

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,299
environments can if that's a concern

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:49,970
portion of this project

00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:52,190
so prior to satellite six can tell the

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,169
form are actually two separate projects

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,340
they you could do a single insulation

00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:58,549
Katella you could do a single

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,230
installation of for me until satellite

00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:03,890
six came along they decided to actually

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:06,830
add tell it as a plugin deployment so

00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:08,690
that they are actually now one project

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,400
that you can still you can still install

00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:15,679
Foreman with Alcatel oh but you can't

00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:20,980
install the television so hello is

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,980
basically what provides you with content

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:35,390
so it's based on subscription content

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,670
management I'm sure any of you that have

00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:42,800
previously used satellite five and then

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,800
