oh yeah right there okay I'm good yay

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:18,660
Ellen Robertson so as he sat down master

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:20,160
of technology and mainly master

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,470
volunteers the very first talk I ever

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,850
gave on linux had met much worse

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,029
problems with this with the technology

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,760
that so you guys should feel right at

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,219
home but that was a long time ago what's

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,050
up with this no no can I hit just your

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,610
return I think it yeah I can just hit

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,940
return which is what I wanted to do just

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,260
leave me alone so this is the outline

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,450
for the talk i'm going to ask you a few

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,770
questions and then i can talk about why

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,239
you should contribute to an open source

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,789
project and i'm going to talk about

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,469
which one you should contribute to what

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,140
what you should consider doing to

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,730
contribute to it and of course then

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,180
after having done all that the next step

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,510
is just to do it right so here's here's

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,949
the so how many people in the how many

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,290
people in the room use open source

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,460
software at work how many people use

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,360
that's how wes is right in the next one

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,390
is how many people use open source

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,180
applications at work any people use open

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,009
source system management tools at work

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,210
fewer so that's then you're really good

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,430
candidates for a lot of this because

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,570
we'll go on and explain what how many of

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,229
the people in the room have made small

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,850
open source software contributions how

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,850
many have made substantial contributions

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,220
how many have started an open source

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,780
project two or three noticing you didn't

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,759
say substantial but you raise your hand

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,380
on oppa starting line and the last one

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,810
how many started a successful open

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,750
source project by your why you standing

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,399
one person at least so these are the

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,720
different ways in which you can enhance

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,170
your career with open source software

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,820
and as you go down the list I think

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,189
you'll find that the farther you go down

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,469
that list the more enhanced the you know

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,969
the more and more you see how it helps

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,799
your your career so the rules of the

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,520
road here are feel free to ask questions

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,170
during the talk but try not to star if

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,860
you fall asleep because if you do your

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,930
wake here and

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,550
her up and that's never a good thing

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,140
it's really rude isn't it the guy dicks

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,870
to your story Eddie wakes you up that's

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,610
that's just not acceptable so the real

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,170
ones have all kinds of you know you know

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,730
i preciate bullet and they go down one

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,410
bullet at a time so that won't happen

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,870
here on PDF but you get the idea of in

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,280
any way why would you want to do this

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,170
from the work perspective there are a

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,240
lot so different motivations depend for

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,640
work and different motivations from your

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,040
perspective well if you do this if you

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,780
use open source stuff at work then you

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,250
can use this to improve your local

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,680
environment make things better where you

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,220
work if you can contribute to projects

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,489
and so on that are used by your your

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,760
place where you work you can fix locally

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,950
critical bugs you have the opportunity

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,260
if you the one of the things that

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,910
probably most of you know if you help

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,040
out an open source project and you need

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,010
help yourself it's funny how quick

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,410
people come to help you it's not funny

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,060
at all actually I mean people on my

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,760
projects who come and help something's

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,890
like yeah I'd do anything to help you so

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,510
this is not New York but i'll tell the

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,730
stony way how's New York and there's a

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,150
guy I met a guy who who had done by

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,650
documentation and and I said man that's

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,180
that's so great I really appreciate it

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,560
is this kind of kiss your feet man and I

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:38,850
found out later in New York they charge

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:41,010
for that so what can I say and and but

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,810
you can get priority help you become the

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,370
local expert because by contributing to

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,670
you learn more about it than you would

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,780
just by using it you know if your person

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,280
who contributes back to it you'll learn

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,140
the ins and outs of how it works you'll

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,980
listen to the conversations you'll learn

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,660
stuff you would otherwise never learn

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,980
you then can cross pollinate between

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,750
your understanding of the project that

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,100
you know about and the other projects

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,350
the other things that are related to it

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,970
in the environment and you can use your

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,769
knowledge about that to help both things

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,390
that work in potentially other projects

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,070
that you might be involved with it's

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,750
like oh I see on this project how you

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,610
did it this way and that would be a

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,620
really handy technique for me to use at

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,180
work so that's an example of how

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,080
cross-pollination can help you here as

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,690
well and to go a little farther you can

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,220
in turn provide expertise initiative and

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,960
leadership in other words this

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,110
you an opportunity to become a leader in

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,930
your organization it really does because

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,880
now you're looked at quite rightfully as

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,370
the person who understands this you know

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,670
in the land of the land of the blind the

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,350
one-eyed man is king so if you know a

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,120
little about it that's probably a lot

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,310
more than most year people around you

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,260
know about it right and you have access

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,060
to the experts and pretty soon people

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,020
mistake you for an expert and the next

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,400
thing you know you'll be showing up to

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,830
conferences and people will still

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,170
mistake you for somebody important and

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:04,300
that's what happens to me all the time I

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,740
got and you know it's like you try not

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,850
to disabuse them of that note soon you

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,450
get here it's like they're really nice

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:15,760
to me they've mistaken me for somebody

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:18,190
important so wife why would you want to

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,260
do this from your own perspective what

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,440
is it that would benefit you not your

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,840
work but you well you learn you grow

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,240
it's interesting you know you learn

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,660
stuff it's like oh I never thought about

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,980
doing it that way oh I see how that was

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,650
a big mistake and I don't want to repeat

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,669
it Oh what you know the dots of

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,940
different ways of which you can learn

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,950
and grow in the process and in fact open

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,860
source is in some ways the ideal place

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,930
to learn and grow you make friends I've

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,500
made friends on projects whom I've never

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,540
met and some of them I call up and have

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,330
conversations with and we have a good

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,680
time we chat and we talk on the phone as

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,740
well as by IRC and email you get to meet

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,450
really cool people I've run into Mad Dog

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,090
I don't know a dozen times over the

00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,640
world in different places and yeah he

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,560
knows who I am and sees me and says

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,330
hello when he sees me again he's

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,140
mistaken me for somebody important too

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,880
and and you become kind of well-known

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,860
it's like oh you're that guy that did

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,350
that what was that thing you're the guy

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,990
who did it right whatever it was and and

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,120
and and and actually I had somebody say

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,010
something like oh I asked him well if

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,930
you're at a Linux a che or heartbeat or

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,610
pacemakers and the guy says oh yeah I

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,410
know about that really you can be a

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,150
competent system administrator out

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,310
that's like wow really i didn't think so

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,930
but he did so i'm gonna go with his

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,900
opinion right

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,419
and you have the opportunity for

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,350
worldwide leadership it's really true

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,669
that this is how you do this you do it

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,960
you get invited to places and once

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,520
you're invited to one place outside your

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,680
country you're a worldwide leader man

00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,150
that's how it works that's the world you

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,650
know here where I live and somewhere

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,630
else that's it and and and you and can

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,490
improve your job prospects and indeed

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,979
that's something that I'm going to talk

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,440
about in more detail here more than you

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,599
can imagine open source can help your

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,880
future job prospects I will tell this

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,410
story I was in I worked for IBM for 13

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,570
years and while I worked for IBM i went

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,580
to china had some guys who work for me

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,380
on the open source project in china and

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,789
that was in a room full of chinese guys

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,919
and you know you never know with culture

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,210
how things are going to translate so I

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,710
was there with these guys there and I

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,880
wanted to tell them look you should

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,740
contribute to open source projects

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,780
because it'll do your career a lot of

00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,340
good outside IBM but I didn't want to

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,440
say that if there were the IBM managers

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,830
in the room that wouldn't go over very

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,020
well so so I but I can't tell you know

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,030
culturally if I have a room full of

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,380
Americans I can spot the managers you

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,990
know you can spot him you know how you

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,699
know what I mean and and but with the

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,970
Chinese guys I was not sure I could do

00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,530
that so I said I said are there any

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,970
managers in the room and they all look

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,979
around and look around and finally they

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,560
turn her head and say no and I said good

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,750
like that good and they all just burst

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,880
out laughing right that that that's

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,280
Universal humor by the way the dilbert

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,659
humor of oh my god I'm glad there's no

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,710
managers and now we can really talk

00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:20,860
right so so that the dilbert Dilbert is

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,940
universally translatable right so so

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,440
there I wanted to tell them the same

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,900
thing I'm telling you here basically is

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,400
that this is good for your career

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,720
especially outside the stuff I talked

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,090
about before is how it helps your career

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,919
inside your company this piece here is a

00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,719
cruisy job prospects outside your

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,680
company and I will talk more about that

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,539
in detail here now what happened here is

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,579
that that's backwards right yeah why is

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,360
it going backwards now why is it going

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:48,579
because I push the wrong button okay oh

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,930
I have a mouse in the wrong place

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,300
apparently you have to have the mouse in

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,940
the right place then it goes forward

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,320
I still hit return but if the mouse is

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,570
over here it goes backwards and the

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,009
mouse is over there goes forward so so

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,720
here's an examples of some people that I

00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,699
know of that I've asked he mentioned I

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,079
did a survey of people what all have you

00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:08,600
done to contribute to open source

00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:11,420
projects and how has it helped you know

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,690
and has it helped your careers Brent

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,100
Chapman wrote majordomo and he wrote it

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,370
because he needed to have a mailing list

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,630
right so he wrote majordomo to solve a

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,829
problem he had he wanted to have a

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,930
mailing list for something he was

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,240
working on I think a firewall actually

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,120
and so he wrote majordomo and it became

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,269
for many years the dominant mailing list

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
provider until things like mailman and

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,690
so on come on which I think are more

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,670
popular today little simpler to manage

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,100
from the web and all back then the web

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,199
wasn't so much a thing right so he did

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,089
that and suddenly became popular not

00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:46,069
just for the firewalls in you about four

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,829
major domo and he went on to people ask

00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,329
him because he managed the list he

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:51,649
learned more about firewalls than

00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,850
anybody else that people ask him to

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,350
write a book so he wrote a book and now

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,290
he's famous for firewalls and four major

00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,019
domo both and he did it by showing up it

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:03,350
is true life at ninety percent of life

00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:07,300
is showing up you show up and do

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:09,709
something show up and do something

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,199
that's how i get started i went to a

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,149
linux users group and somebody says it

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,040
says we should just do that so i just

00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,449
did that and that's kind of how i got

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,160
started in linux in the stuff I did you

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,709
show up and just do stuff that's in

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,569
front of year to do and and it

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,310
progresses in this way if you just keep

00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:29,240
showing up in doing what's in front of

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:31,370
you to do Don Foster is a woman who was

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,420
who is a public community leader and she

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,389
wound up then coming to work for puppet

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,000
and now she's off doing PhD research on

00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,850
open source projects and so now this is

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,279
all Dom cascaded from her involvement in

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,560
the puppet community rusty russell how

00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,130
many people know rusty how many people

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,930
know about IP change yeah so rusty is

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,459
the guy who wrote the tools to manage IP

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,870
chains when they first came out because

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,610
there weren't any tools to do it he says

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,380
well I want to be able to do that and so

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,019
he wrote the tools to do it and he is

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,209
for so anyone on to found basically the

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,850
the premier linux conference in

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,019
australia

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,620
and honestly one of the best lens

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,690
conferences I've ever been to and and

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,449
and he's now now has been working

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,980
full-time for various people on open

00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:20,399
source since that time I think he's

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,019
still with IBM was last I checked one or

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,170
more here in the room he told me that

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,970
he'd started out with a blog and bug

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,529
fixes and puppet modules and that has

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,410
helped his career in a variety of ways

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,209
these things make you well known in your

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,529
community when you show up and do stuff

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,990
people say well he's the guy who does

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,029
stuff right that's what happens and

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,649
therefore people think you're it mistake

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:45,209
you for an expert and this is how it

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:47,130
happens and and leme Hall is another guy

00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,930
who did open source book reviews and so

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,279
all of a sudden now people think his

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,630
expert of these areas of which he

00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,449
reviews and he gets lots of free books

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,100
too he likes to read so he reviews books

00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:57,569
up volunteers the review books and he

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,709
gets all the technical books he wants

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:05,759
for free Chris Lindberg wrote doc docs

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,110
for nagios plugin Daniel Valeyard who

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,819
works for Red Hat and has for a long

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,819
time wrote rpm how many people have

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:13,649
heard of RPM find net well Daniel wrote

00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:17,189
that because he couldn't find our pm's

00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,889
it's like now today with this was before

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:22,949
Yom so there weren't even any for when

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:25,589
you had to resolve dependencies it was a

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:28,380
it was a nightmare it was a nightmare

00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,639
and and so Daniel wrote this tool that

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,680
did that and he's been working for red

00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,240
edge I don't know how long 15 years or

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,860
something like that as a result of

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,709
starting and writing RPM find Annete

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:43,410
Paul Morgan wrote did some imported

00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:45,720
putito to Python 3 and did something

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,430
called wormhole and he's now you know

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,459
basically also well known in the

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,709
community Alan Jed did it be as d ports

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,569
and ZFS documentation docket documents

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,699
and these people do all these things to

00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,930
contribute and they've all talked about

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:00,540
how dramatically this has helped their

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,620
career the last three are unique and i

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,819
want to tell you their stories in

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,319
particular because they were people who

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:08,880
worked on my projects so David Lee are

00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,860
ported Linux HHA even those called linux

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,439
aj it was really not that linux specific

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,889
to run on solaris and he was the voice

00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:18,569
of reason he can really be the voice of

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,740
reason an argument he could you know

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,940
what people arguing he would

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,080
something that's like oh that makes so

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,270
much sense and it would the argument

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,340
coming go away he would defuse it and so

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,540
when he went to look for a new job he

00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,820
said would you mind writing me a

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,400
reference this is you bet I would you

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,840
bet I would and and so I wrote him a

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,430
reference and he tells me that that

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,260
reference was the reason I think this

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,840
has happened twice that I writing

00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,770
references that got him new jobs what

00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,120
and the Dan Muhammad ah Jake last time I

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,130
gave this talk to people in the room who

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,650
had gotten support from him he's worked

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,420
on pacemaker heartbeat in Linux tha and

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:55,160
probably not by now some other things as

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,230
well for Souza for a number of years and

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,260
he was he was a customer of Linux a che

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,420
and he was contributing some plugins

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,920
back to the project and and what Susan

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,390
was looking for people i said and i

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,070
talked to him and he said I'm not happy

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,140
where I am at IBM i was at IBM so I

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,440
helped him leave IBM really shouldn't

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,240
say I guess but but he wasn't happy

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,590
there he was a contractor and he was

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,480
being treated kind of badly by his

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,710
management and funny how much they came

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,430
to value him the moment he said he

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:26,010
wanted to leave somebody went to went to

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,290
go work for Souza and he's been working

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:32,580
on that stuff since then full time open

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:35,640
source work JC one Carlos Tong

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,790
interesting guy with two Hispanic first

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,290
name and Asia and last name that's why

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,200
he goes by JC I think because he doesn't

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,350
want to explain why Jason y juan carlos

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,760
goes with tong anyway so JC is the most

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,990
recent one i had to add this because it

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,280
happened the last couple months JC

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,980
wanted his company was going to be

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,280
crashing and burning pretty soon and he

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,780
wanted a way out without under his terms

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,250
they were just going to say no no can't

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,950
you stay until the end and then we'll

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,940
fire everybody when we crash and burn

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,200
anybody ever heard of a company wanting

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,290
to do that you know they want everybody

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,790
to stay until they fire you right so he

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,930
for some reason he didn't want to do

00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,060
that and and he wanted to go on his own

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,740
volition to a place of his own choosing

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,990
at a timing of his own choosing right

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,320
rather than desperation like I don't

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,240
have a paycheck but the problem was he

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,770
didn't want to take any references where

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,200
he worked because that would like tip

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:33,070
him off that he was leaving so he asked

00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,750
me if I do that says you sure bet

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,820
so let me tell you what he did for us he

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,500
did any people know about about

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,020
continuous integration and that kind of

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,280
stuff see I so he did see I work for the

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,140
for the assimilation project and and he

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,520
said he said he showed up and says I'd

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,470
like to help but I said what you want to

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,910
do is I'm assistant administrator I said

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,350
I need some see I work do you want to do

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,230
it says I don't know anything about it

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,940
says that's okay neither do i and I said

00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,740
there's this book this is I know you

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,360
should use Jenkins I said usually I knew

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,370
that is you should use Jenkins and and

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
so he says okay what I don't know

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,780
anything about Jenkins i said here's a

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,250
book and and I said make it go away make

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
the problem go away so he made it go

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,250
away and he used Jenkins he did

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,320
something unique by the way Howard's

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,630
because it wasn't easy to hook into my

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,130
particular thing whenever I wanted to

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,020
start a new build I would say the tweet

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,310
to a certain address and it would in the

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,630
tweet would cause it to be kicked off

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,830
which I thought was an interesting way

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,350
of doing it I would not have thought it

00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,550
to it that way but it actually it was

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,800
kind of nice because it was a private

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,120
tweet and only people that he you know

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,460
he could then control the permissions

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,590
through Twitter actually and so that

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,230
worked really well actually so when they

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,540
asked me well you know so now his job

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,180
what he does now full time is continuous

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,430
integration for someone else the thing

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,780
he decided he liked doing for me he want

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,980
his head he wanted to do for a living

00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,740
and he found somebody who wanted to pay

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,270
him to do it so he kind of moved on and

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,950
this is the kind of thing that can

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,890
happen if you help an open source

00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:01,630
project you know there are projects

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:04,360
where people are not as nice you know it

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:08,260
happens but most places like I said

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:12,010
they're delighted to have delighted to

00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:14,829
have your you show up and help and we're

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,900
back aren't we okay so let me talk about

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,910
my career which which is more amusing

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,380
than all of the above right so I've

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,000
written software and does system

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,980
administration work i did sysadmin work

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,320
for about 10 years and i've been on the

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,440
she may have this guest I've been in the

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,720
business longer than 10 years when I

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,030
started writing the shell scripts the

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,270
bourne shell was not yet the standard

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:39,280
shell it was the mash shell so this was

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,340
like 1978 so I've been at this a long

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,480
time when I'm trying to say here and

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,790
somewhere along the line I founded let

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,840
me say che and the way this worked was I

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,890
had the

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,270
we're supposed to be looking at new

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,679
technology is that the data center white

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,669
might have provided bring in and I

00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,830
discovered there's this thing called

00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,330
linux and I looked at it I came to my

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,860
second level manager who spawned this

00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,440
task and i said i think linux is going

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,640
to be important and he said really what

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,020
does they have for high availability and

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,830
i didn't want to tell him i didn't know

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,390
what that was so you know you you don't

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,559
do that to your second level boss you

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,360
just like you don't go well you say oh

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,650
yeah yeah I'll find out yeah I'll find

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,750
out in the meantime I'll find out what

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:18,130
it is and so so I go off and find out

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,210
what it is and i go to look and i

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,950
discovered that they have a mailing list

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,169
that works really well and no software

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,270
and I one of the guys there had written

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,340
a how-to that wasn't like a normal how

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,659
to it's like how to write H a software

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,460
for linux it was so you couldn't like

00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:36,159
use software so i read it listen I could

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,990
do that came back and said my second

00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,789
level managers I could do something to

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,409
start a project around this if you think

00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,580
it's interesting but you'd have to help

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,320
me with the legal paperwork with the

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,600
company so it could be open source he

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,770
said sure I do that so I went off and

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,299
wrote this stuff and didn't know

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,149
anything about it I'd never done sockets

00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:53,799
programming had never found it on an

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,360
open source project you kind of just

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,590
show up and do it right what was in

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,500
front of me to do so that's what I did

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,110
and I didn't know anything about it it's

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,330
like accept this how to and and and

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:09,159
that's how I became a world-class expert

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:11,860
on it no joke I tell you people still

00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,960
mistake me for that today so then I'm

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,279
sorry when Souza came along it says oh

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,580
this is really cool why don't you come

00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,440
work for us and this is like late

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,940
nineteen ninety-nine early 2000s oh this

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,710
is really cool i could go do that linux

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,990
that linux was off to go booming off the

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,570
charts then the tech bubble burst that i

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,000
had to find a job you know when Souza

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,070
had to bail and dump a bunch of their

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,620
staff i had to find a new place to go

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,210
the interesting thing was I'd been on

00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,270
this project just a couple year and a

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,470
half or so total but when I went to look

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:47,529
for a job in 2001 I had 12 companies

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:51,909
asked me to interview in 30 hours during

00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:53,470
the tech bubble burst okay and that's

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:58,330
because they had mistaken me for

00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:01,120
somebody important and and and I was

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:04,630
floored I was

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,830
floored I was humbled and I couldn't

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,360
believe this because I had done a lot

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:14,350
more interesting and important work for

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,680
Bell Labs before right but nobody knew

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,600
about it people know about this it was

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,850
simple it was straightforward it was not

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,620
complicated which i think is why people

00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:28,920
liked it it's like I could I could make

00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:31,420
that work you know and and so this is

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,090
that's what happened to me as a result

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,150
of that and so I did that for a while

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,710
and then I reached the time when IBM no

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,809
longer wanted to pay me to work and so I

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,330
went to IBM after the tech bubble burst

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:45,309
and and stayed there for about 13 years

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,410
and the first seven or so I still worked

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:48,610
on linux HHA and then I worked with

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,200
maybe 12 and a half years I forget

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,530
exactly exactly you know time flies when

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,970
you having fun and so I I stopped

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,470
working on the Linux hae cuz my

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,179
management stop wanting to pay me on it

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,190
pay me for it and there were the usual

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,190
level of conflicts in open source

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,630
projects that i decided that so my head

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,040
hurts really hard from banging against

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,679
the wall and nobody's paying me to do it

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,300
anymore and my by the way my criteria

00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,309
physicist guess was the linux h a

00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,710
project was that it would not need me

00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:17,740
one day and i looked around and realized

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,809
it didn't need me so I said declared

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,970
success which was my original intent and

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:27,130
moved on right so i started this other

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:33,960
project a few years later inter password

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,960
it says so huh yeah he stepped out

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:44,020
so what's his girlfriend's name right

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:46,960
whatever so and so this is the truth

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,640
about me this is how this happened this

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,470
is why people invite me to come speak at

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,080
places is because I showed up and did

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,450
what was in front of me to do now I'm

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,060
pretty good at it I mean that helps it

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,490
helps a lot but it's not enough actually

00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,560
check the input terminal right so it's

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,890
not enough what's important is that you

00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:09,190
show up and do it now so the next slide

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:11,260
will be talking about what project right

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,260
now I'm into this besides I remember

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:18,130
what they look like so the next slide

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,230
says what should be looking at for for

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,520
an open source project to do well the

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,140
first thing you should do is think about

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,270
the open source projects you use at work

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,370
if you want to maximize the benefit to

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,320
your employer maximize your ability to

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,540
get time to do it on company time to

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,860
learn this stuff on company time

00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:35,710
maximize the chances of your company

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:39,100
company's sending you places to to deal

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,800
with this then then I would start with I

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,050
would start with things that that your

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,150
company is interested in having you do

00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,030
the second thing is look at things you

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,260
want to learn so there's actually

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,120
another example I want to give by the

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,500
way that's an interesting one so there's

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,030
someone else on my projects who wrote

00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,680
this some of the software to listen to

00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,510
art packets so we could discover your

00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,510
