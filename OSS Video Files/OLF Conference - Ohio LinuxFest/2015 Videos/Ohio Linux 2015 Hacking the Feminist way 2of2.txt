00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,140
modify you can sell them if you want to

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,070
I don't know why people live by them

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,420
that go ahead and try and I'm really

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,130
hoping that a little bit because is

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,960
common and pervasive as a sexual

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,699
harassment prevention training so yeah

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,650
the goal of the ally skills workshop is

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,199
to teach you simple everyday ways as a

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,269
man that you can act in your workplace

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,269
or your community online or in person

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,720
and support women so I recommend you

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,960
check it out oh one more thing this this

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
year's workshop is supported by a

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,510
one-hundred-thousand-dollar donation

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,690
from an anonymous linux kernel developer

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:45,809
so i'll be teaching one more at linux

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,520
continent dublin so I thank you very

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,219
much to that anonymous linux kernel

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,910
developers I i understand that

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,750
yesterday's workshop was the last one to

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,620
be under the umbrella of the ADA

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:06,240
initiative funding in the United States

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,930
and the next one would be in Devlin next

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,020
week and I just wanted to thank you for

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,380
for sharing that incredible opportunity

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,070
with us now this is the penultimate

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,909
question that I have prepared for

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,909
gallery the ADA initiative is shutting

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,299
down goodness and a couple weeks now now

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,729
I would like you to make this decision

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,700
and what are you doing other than

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:42,780
putting out there with a good license

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,420
for that the Allies workshop for the

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,110
other great works that initiative is

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,259
produced yeah so the short version is

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm trying to run a small nonprofit it's

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,750
really hard and I basically got

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,850
exhausted was ready to do something else

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,090
and it just turned out to be really hard

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,979
to hire somebody but this

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,679
civic mix of skills that is needed to

00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:06,850
grow the addition to the next level but

00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,679
the nice thing is that we were already

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,319
open sourcing most of our work because

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,030
we're an open source organization so

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,220
things like the conference anti grassman

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,810
policy we're already fully other people

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,959
are creating things on github and

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,760
merging pull requests and someone else

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,549
is maintaining the wiki page that lists

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,959
the thousands of conferences using it so

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,879
that was really great you guys so we

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,709
took all of our planning documents for

00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,450
the 848 a camp and we open sourced those

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,280
as well so including these really

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,780
detailed timelines about when you need

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,610
to be talking to the child care people

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,190
order to get the child care done in it

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,190
advice for talking to move caterers wow

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,410
it's really hard to get good vegan food

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,450
that has actual calories in it you're

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,319
like that's a 200 calorie lunch nobody's

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:54,930
happy with that yeah we've got more

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,980
iceberg lips I Utley take a lot of that

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,780
we also did something called the

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,849
imposter syndrome workshop which teaches

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,590
women how to overcome impostor syndrome

00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:05,380
which is really rampant and open source

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,609
software and then we trained a lot all

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,859
the people to teach the galley skills

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:10,480
workshop I'm personally taking a nice

00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,310
long two-month vacation the long

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,220
vacation I've ever taken in my adult

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,900
life and I will actually be teaching the

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,569
alley skills workshop again at

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,560
conferences and that companies and

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:26,200
things like that starting in January oh

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,989
and excellent excellent I'm very glad to

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,430
hear now this is the final question so

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:35,290
if you have a question in line please

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,160
pass it to one of our volunteers and we

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,519
can see what we can do this is the final

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:47,980
question so I'd better make it good so

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:52,720
how can the people in this room make the

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:57,549
Linux community more welcoming to women

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,160
under workers in the group's everyone so

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm going to ask

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,410
do something that seems both trivial but

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,390
also very hard so let me do a little

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,810
explanation and then I'll ask I'll ask

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,270
you to do something specific so so I

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,270
feel that the primary source of the

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:18,769
problems and Linux is this attitude that

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:22,170
being a jerk is awesome and cool right

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,730
so as a counter example to show you that

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,100
you can write good software and have a

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,150
thriving community without that I'm

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,960
going to appoint you at the Python

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,960
community dito van Rossum is a super

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,840
nice guy it's done amazing development

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,210
work he's also he also wears a feminist

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,740
t-shirt to most of his keynotes and he

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,450
once gave a keynote and only answer

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,680
questions from women because he noticed

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,740
that men were asking most of the

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,770
questions so as a result Python the

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:54,660
Python conference Python went from one

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:58,320
percent women speakers in 2011 it's

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,080
remarkably recent to today they now have

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,420
thirty percent women attendees and fifty

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,770
percent women speakers right they've

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,570
completely changed the makeup of the

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,870
community and a lot of it has to do with

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,350
leadership video van Rossum so there's

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,360
this myth that um being a jerk makes

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,770
better software so i really want to

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,540
address that right away I feel like well

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,520
I look she's so terrible Linux is

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,020
amazing even though I trashes my files

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,060
whenever I crash you know so very

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,620
recently made 2015 there's paper that

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,050
came out studying open source projects

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,710
using the agile methodology just because

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,570
they had an easier time of tracking this

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,640
is the what the paper found and this is

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,430
a quote I'm just gonna read it the more

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,040
polite developers were the less time it

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,750
took to fix an issue and in the majority

00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,220
of the analyzed cases the more

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,840
developers wanted to be part of a

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,640
project the more they were willing to

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,400
continue working on the project over

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,889
time so being nice to each other and

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,439
you're to the

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,949
community makes better software faster

00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,110
and makes you happy just really

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,689
important so I want to compare this to

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,560
linux and our Idol and Linux whose

00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:11,439
limits Horrible's we like to apply when

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,759
he flips people off on stage we like to

00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:17,439
retweet his jokes when he jokingly says

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,840
that he's just coasting off everyone

00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:25,270
else's work secret it's not a joke he is

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,770
right when did you flame someone on a

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,419
mailing list we just get out our popcorn

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,490
we send it to each other are we right on

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,590
you know funny comments of linux weekly

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,879
news ah so here's the part we're going

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,310
to ask you to do something hard I'm

00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,740
going to ask you that whenever somebody

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,810
is a jerk in Linux instead of laughing

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,039
and pointing and joining it in the fun

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,199
to say I don't think that's so great to

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,120
reply and say if someone's talking about

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,740
an IRC channel actually I think that's

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,990
really mean and that's against the kind

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,550
of attitude i want to have here if

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,009
someone's wearing a shirt that makes fun

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,379
of users I want you to say something to

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,879
them hey you know that shirt kind of

00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,650
makes me feel uncomfortable we all

00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,919
started out of users and there's plenty

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,439
of users here or seeing or sure right

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,240
and then I think that's what it takes

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,770
that's the only way that our culture is

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,870
going to change and the only way that

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,089
we're going to retrieve new people look

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,199
people like I was with my alpha New

00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:22,500
Mexico Tech and done so yeah that you

00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,500
stole

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,110
that was so awesome so now we begin the

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,919
audience questions are their major

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:46,189
computer conferences without our rations

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:58,819
and costing now to avoid not to search

00:07:46,189 --> 00:08:05,810
out our their computer related speakers

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:09,439
who like John Scalzi refused to speak at

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,650
conferences without such a policy great

00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,289
question so to my knowledge the only

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,389
major computer conferences left without

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:21,680
anti-harassment policies are the DEFCON

00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:23,749
conference the hacking conference in Las

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,669
Vegas the big one and I think they have

00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:28,789
like a very mild one that is actually

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,490
useless and things like CES consumer

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,110
electronics other than that I mean

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,620
definitely in the area of open source

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,969
software everybody's got one these days

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,620
speakers who refuse to speak at

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:44,199
conferences of value anti-harassment

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:49,250
policies in this field mean for sure

00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:50,930
purely sorry alex bailey let's see i

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,970
don't know any oh there's a whole bunch

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,310
of people who signed in the Python

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,319
community who signed the pledge on the

00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,519
web page let's get let's get louder I

00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,170
think if you search for that you'll find

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,339
it and they all agreed not to speak at a

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,319
conference without an anti-harassment

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,840
policy and I encourage all of you to

00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:09,310
have the same rule

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,560
we got there yes I I personally have the

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,160
rule that they have to either have an

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:18,180
anti-harassment policy or if it's thrown

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,570
by a corporation and code of conduct

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:26,380
within the free software project that

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:30,100
that company represents is so I happen

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:35,020
to strongly agree with this okay all

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:38,860
right so do you think the science

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:44,740
mathematics interest yeah for women

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:47,670
begins so early like in grade school yes

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:52,210
it's very clear the research shows that

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:53,800
young girls tend start to get put off by

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,080
the negative messages that they're

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,700
getting very early on sometimes some

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,800
time in grade school usually is the case

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,520
each of us has a different story and

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,930
path but yes it happens quite early

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,700
that's a reason not to keep doing work

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:15,910
later on for time management purposes

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:18,910
can somebody tell me oh it's 47 okay

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,210
fantastic we definitely have time for

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:25,450
some more when did you first become

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,080
interested in computer science and why

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,970
what were some of the barriers or

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,330
assistance you received in grade school

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,150
high school to allow you to pursue a

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,590
career in computer science in grade

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,200
school in high school where your

00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,250
interests in math and sciences if not

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,850
what were your interests well that's a

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,830
definitely a lot of points uh so one of

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,889
the things I realized as I became part

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:57,970
of Linux is just how lucky and how

00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,410
usual my experiences were so my I had a

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,809
distinct memory of playing with punch

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,059
cards in my mother's lab when I was two

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:05,559
or three years old so my mother was a

00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:08,079
computer programmer and we always had a

00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,549
computer in the house I was also

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,579
happened to be really good at

00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:14,410
mathematics and I was socially isolated

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:16,529
enough that nobody told me that I wasn't

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,730
supposed to be good at mathematics so

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,799
again I just got really lucky it was a

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,489
combination of being being good at

00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,049
things and be escaping the messages the

00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:27,699
interesting thing is that even though I

00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:29,889
grew up with a mother who was a computer

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,199
programmer and having multiple computers

00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:35,529
in the house from as young as i can

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:38,169
remember that i actually didn't consider

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,839
computer programming as a career until I

00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:42,879
was 17 until then I wanted to be a

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,739
fiction writer because i enjoy reading

00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:49,059
science fiction so clearly i should

00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:52,389
write it as well right so what happened

00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:54,879
is I went to DEFCON the conference

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:58,449
without an anti-harassment policy at

00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,959
DEFCON 3 when I was 17 and I'm sorry to

00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:04,029
say but my thought process went like

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,919
this wow these people have a lot of

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,399
money and they wear black leather and

00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,110
they're very cool maybe I was that are

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,579
being a computer programmer and then it

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,829
turned out I was really good at it I

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:17,559
enjoyed it so that's it that's how I

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:19,329
ended up waiting that way but it really

00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,910
good just goes to show like how many

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:24,339
things I had to have stacked in my favor

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,189
before I went a different route from

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,910
everyone else of my daugther all right

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:33,069
this question i'm going to put into

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,160
context that we actually in turn right

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:40,350
into anti-harassment policy what

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,230
operating system you choose is not to be

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:46,480
frowned upon here alright so this person

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:52,049
is legitimately asking for your help how

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:57,999
do you let run linux on your mac apple

00:12:52,049 --> 00:13:01,660
OSX what does Stroh what mac OS is it 10

00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:05,230
10 so oh gosh I

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,910
I'm running 10 9 still yep whatever

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,400
Mavericks is I did not do know somebody

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,350
I've heard many bad things so I've done

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,810
it a bunch of different ways the most

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:17,710
convenient way is to run one of the

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,940
virtualization platforms boy I can't

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:25,120
remember which one i used i tried

00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:27,850
several so the issue is each as each new

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,980
piece of Matt Harper comes out it may

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,590
take a while for Linux drivers to become

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,630
ready for it and so sometimes doing the

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,360
virtualization is the best way forward

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,850
when i install it on bare metal the last

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,840
time I did that was using the mint linux

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,680
distribution that one worked pretty well

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,850
the thing that you're going to have to

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,700
do a lot of the times is booting off the

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:54,940
installation media is going to be really

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,010
hard so I often do this thing where I

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,320
here's disk utility to create a new

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,940
partition on the hard drive and I

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,430
install the instant I copy the

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,550
installation media onto that partition

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,100
of the hard drive and then i use the

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,840
open firmware console to do from the

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,420
partition and the hard drive and there's

00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,830
a stuff in there involving our re-fi

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,800
before you can do that so that's

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,080
generally the general idea of the

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,260
several hours of pain I go through to

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:29,380
make this happen each all right this

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:31,710
next question is from somebody who went

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,890
high school with a student-led

00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:39,460
programming club and wants to know how

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:42,940
to work to make them more inclusive and

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:49,600
be an advocate for the voices who prefer

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:52,000
to be quiet and or on the sidelines so

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,660
one of the ways you can help people have

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,980
a chance to be heard is

00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:02,940
to create a create a standard in a

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,740
culture and an expectation that it's not

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,139
whoever gets to interrupt the most or

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,839
speaks the loudest but that there's

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,149
someone whose job it is in order to give

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,740
people a chance to speak and that

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,000
everyone actually has this ability but

00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,889
it's good to start out with DES

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,139
designating a person if you look up the

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:20,430
concept of gatekeeper this is someone

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,230
who's paying attention to see who's

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,730
getting a chance to speak and invites

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,740
people interrupts people they're

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,170
speaking too much and invites people to

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,939
speak if they're being quiet so this is

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,339
theoretically what a teacher is supposed

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:34,769
to do in the student life club I was

00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,410
just starting out the first session of

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,360
the year by introducing this concept and

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,670
then choosing a person for each meeting

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,779
to be the official gatekeeper it's

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:47,220
really important that everyone feels

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:48,870
like they have the ability to break in

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,329
if the gatekeeper isn't doing their job

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:55,709
and still interrupt people and ask other

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:57,899
people what to say I think that we might

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:02,790
have time for one more question what is

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:06,839
your opinion of butter this is you're

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:10,949
pronouncing correctly uh yeah um it's

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,300
it's a it's a very exciting file system

00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:15,480
technically it's got a lot of hard work

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:20,189
put into it if you look at Russell

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,829
cocoran blog he's in australia bt p is

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,360
what i usually goes by as user name I he

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:25,920
has a lot of detail information about

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,490
his experience installing and running

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,639
but RFS in a production environment I

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:35,860
think better of us needs more investment

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,940
from companies that use Linux thing

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:43,140
institute being the file system that is

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,779
the most useful as a server so I really

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,390
encourages and corner cases when it

00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:52,089
could use some more work with debugging

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,070
and testing and things like that I think

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:55,779
it's a great file system I'm very

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,720
excited it represents a lot of hard work

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,220
and just needs a little more investment

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:12,400
from the companies that benefit the most

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:14,919
from Linux thank you very much I have an

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,350
expo and conference plan today you can

00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,900
pick up a schedule sheet and checking if

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:26,110
you haven't already done so please check

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:30,010
out the expo area and the 168 area I

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:32,410
will probably be wondering all about it

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,390
need anything for me I bet the dockyard

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,419
the president of the aisle and expensive

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:39,809
corporation and I'm so excited that

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:39,809
