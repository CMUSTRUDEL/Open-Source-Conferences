00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,129
over so we usually take two to six point

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,440

know this but you and I our careers have

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:47,270
mixed pass quite a bit the first very

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:54,890
first time was in 1999 I actually had a

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:58,330
linux profile 20 and that that's the

00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,430
first time that that I saw you and I

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,130
always looked up to you invite my review

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:08,480
and very so thrilled to have you on the

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,640
stage today so welcome Oh Beth mind I

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,380
just wanted to say I never imagined that

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,510
I would have you honor actually getting

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,280
to work with you in person and come here

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,820
to an eye on linux best I just want to

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,590
say that a good part of the reason why

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,810
Ohio linux fest is so highly regarded

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,550
and so popular still going after all

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,150
these years is your incredible hard work

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:33,380
so thank you oh thanks thanks awesome

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:36,740
and it was at 1999 I'm starting to get

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:40,730
involved with linux in my user group

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,440
just was very supportive however they

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:44,540
were very apologetic that there weren't

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,380
a lot of women involved and that's how I

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,540
got involved with linux chicks too so

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:54,500
Valerie how did you first get involved

00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:59,090
with Linux yeah so I was incredibly

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,940
lucky I was in in 1995 I went to

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,860
university this little tiny College in

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,860
New Mexico called New Mexico Tech

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,330
originally New Mexico my Institute of

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,800
mining and technology but they dropped

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,270
the money so and I I was lucky there

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,740
that there were two linux kernel

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,160
developers working on the power pc

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,070
platforms who were teaching at the

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,140
college at that time and it turns out i

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:28,190
have another connection with ohio linux

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,620
best because john mad dog ha got deck to

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,510
donate an alpha machine to my

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,370
university's computer science department

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,250
and so my first operating system project

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,160
was create implementing soft interrupt

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,010
handler on the Alpha architect alpha

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,820
architecture for linux so yeah just

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:50,160
really lucky really because you know the

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,280
first distro that I was back in nineteen

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:58,950
nine which actually got me into a user

00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:02,640
group setting was the Alpha port of red

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,360
hat linux and back in those days a

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,690
browser was not a bill on that port and

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:17,010
I was trying to compile the Zilla on my

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:18,780
head and having quickly i'm sure well it

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,120
was just right in the days that they had

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:26,730
released the code that that's how it

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:31,620
went so um alright so I got an

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:35,310
what was your first fish oh yeah so I it

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,020
was 1996 so obviously I was probably

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,800
running slackware on a pile of Bobby's

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,900
and indeed I was yeah so I moved on to I

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,120
think Mandrake actually for some reason

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,000
was my next distribution and then I

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,270
started using red hat and then as soon

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,270
as i discovered debian at and how much

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,500
better was been downloading random rpms

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,620
off the internet forever and ever and

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,980
ever i switched to w i used ubuntu for a

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,650
while and unfortunately i eventually got

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,810
tired of being a systems administrator I

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,450
can do it I don't want to so these days

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,940
I run OS 10 on linux because then i can

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:16,110
still use my shell but for some reason

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm sorry OS 10 on max for some reason I

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,400
at some point it always becomes

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,290
necessary for me to install linux on my

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,850
back anyway so I written a few

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,060
introductions for how to install linux

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:35,760
on a recent Mac involved very terrible

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:39,300
accident well I was going back and forth

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,190
through various platforms back in

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,950
nineteen ninety

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,070
and even today so I definitely

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,790
appreciate that back then I was going

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:53,570
back and forth between the proprietary

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:59,390
now-defunct operating system of pyrox

00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:02,930
and to the canoe whoo linux on Alpha and

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:07,250
what was always there for me was via pie

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:11,480
all right so and that's why I am bi

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:15,890
forever what about you wow those were

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,530
the workout yeah interesting thing about

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,710
New Mexico Tech is but there is a group

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,990
of people who were acknowledged to be

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,760
the best computer programmers and the

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,380
university they were called sis Prague's

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,390
for systems programmers they worked at

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,960
the computer center I was a lowly user

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,430
Vincent but they all used emacs and so

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,990
what people would do and they were

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,480
teaching our computer science classes

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,460
they would make us all copy the SIS

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,040
products dotty max configuration files

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,010
and I went looked at my Dadi mats before

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,710
this interview discovered that there was

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,130
a comment in there from 1994 kind of icy

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,700
spots still so so yeah I know enough VI

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,830
to edit etsy files and you know just in

00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,180
case I walked into a computer that's not

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:04,160
attach the network so i can't download

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,320
me vex i got my start in research

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,170
computing to it was actually an

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,980
internship at pittsburgh supercomputing

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,320
that brought me to the the new linux

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,100
operating system and it's been a really

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,130
fun time ever since but but wow you

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:26,680
really and dug into it with all the file

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:30,080
systems working and you even did ZFS on

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:37,010
solaris my goodness where the troika's

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:40,310
and also of course ext3 and the ax t4

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:44,000
and union nouns and it was something

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:47,120
called Joe goodness oh yeah I need the

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,070
file system check FS uh yeah you should

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,910
never let me name things together all

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:58,660
right so tell us a little bit of the

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,240
relative a time and how you use some

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:06,710
feminist principles to come up with a

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,620
solution to architect this classic UNIX

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:12,020
file systems problem boo boo classic I

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,730
like the work okay yeah so this is an

00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,850
interesting combination of technical

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,260
file system stuff and feminism which of

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,800
course made everyone in Akron he was

00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:25,070
very angry when i wrote about it so so

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,080
to understand what I did the first thing

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:29,600
you need to know about it is a little

00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,950
bit of technical background so in UNIX

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,620
files have three timestamps one of them

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,900
is the last time the file was red that's

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,510
called a time the next one is the last

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,420
time of a file was written that's called

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,070
em time and the third one is called see

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,510
time and it's impossible to explain

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,930
without getting it wrong don't worry

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,780
about it so the important thing is that

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:57,140
you know that files and eunuchs have

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,970
these times to have that's stored on

00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,620
disk that says when the file is last one

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,650
and one

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,040
classroom so the thing about writing two

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,660
discs is that it's really slow and

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,700
especially its especially slow if you're

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,180
writing a tiny bit randomly somewhere

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,740
located anywhere on the drive so most of

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,080
the world's data is still on spinning

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,970
disks sure your laptop has an SSD but

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,250
all that data use in the cloud the

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,890
magical Cloud is on a spinning disk and

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,630
it's slow due rights on that so the

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,779
thing about that that is frustrating

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,790
about this is that in the best case when

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,290
you're doing a read the date of your

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,810
reading is cached in memory because

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,940
you've recently read it still sitting

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,810
there all it is is a memory ask that's a

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,880
memory access that's really fast the bad

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,410
part is because UNIX decided you want to

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,940
track the last time that you read a file

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,890
every time you read it even if it

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,220
satisfies it in the memory cache of the

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,570
machine it goes out rights to the disk

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,860
so you can do have a whole lot of really

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,930
efficient reads and then for some reason

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,200
your disk is thrashing and thrashing and

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,550
going really slowly right so a bunch of

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,810
file systems developers have been trying

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,830
to fix this since pretty much 1969 and

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,390
they usually took the spare any

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,420
technical approach it like what if we

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,110
change together the high notes today the

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,430
writing out right and it was all very

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,420
working at the level of inside of the

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:22,510
file system and so what actually despite

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,060
all of the smart people all thinking the

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,430
best solution at the time it was two

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,160
thousand five or something like that was

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,600
to turn off all a time updates so just

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,730
don't track the last time that a file

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,290
system was red and anyone who's running

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,440
the server or one of their laptop to go

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,779
really fast would turn off a time that

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,580
so a bunch of my friends and lynch dicks

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:45,060
that women in linux group that back then

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,650
i discovered each other and so long ago

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,180
we're talking about file systems

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,080
performance why their laptop assist

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,660
though and i told

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,490
just turn off a time and one of my

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,120
friends said oh great now but when I

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,920
turned off a time what stops telling me

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,100
that there was an email this is my

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,840
friend Akana and the thing is is that in

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,130
linux chicks the purpose of linux truce

00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,530
was to create a place where we could

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,230
have technical discussions safely where

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,330
no one would make fun of you or mock you

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,890
and so my friend would never have

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,200
written that on I don't know the

00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,030
learners Colonel mailing list right a

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,410
bunch of people told her how foolish she

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,130
was but she really needed to install

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,630
this new patch tomate so I started

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,670
thinking about this and I realized that

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:32,590
what month wanted to know was has new

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:35,710
email been written to this file since

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,880
the last time I read right it was didn't

00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,400
want to know when was the last time I

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,620
read it they wanted to know has this

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,960
file been red since it was last written

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,570
and that's when I had the idea of Oh

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,830
what if we just update the the a time if

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:53,650
it is after the last written relative a

00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:58,180
time so update the a time relative to

00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:59,680
the last written time so i hacked it up

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,400
and i don't know a few minutes until a

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,350
very complicated piece of code and then

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,450
we tested it on a whole bunch of

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,010
different peoples computers a bunch of

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,230
distros used it in their experimental

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,210
versions and it turned out that all we

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,980
had to do is add one more piece of code

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,290
which said to update the last run time

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,640
every 24 hours because there's a 10

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,930
watch or there's things that we files

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,790
that they haven't been used for a while

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,560
once we added that piece of code it

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,560
worked so well and didn't break any

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,060
applications that people thought it was

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,130
turned on as the default it's like in

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,780
the kernel that's the default option all

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,220
of the destroyer ship with relative

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,660
aight aight i'm too turned on so yeah I

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,940
instead of telling my friend that she

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,880
was technically an idiot and she should

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,500
just suck it up and deal with it I got

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,649
creative and understood that this is

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,290
what the application

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,720
she wanted to do and I have to note that

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:54,589
this was another poor naming decision on

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,809
my part the mount option is RelA time

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:00,470
which looks like a misspelling of real

00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:02,119
time don't let me name things so yes

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,699
that's how feminism help you sold solve

00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:07,429
one of the oldest problems in use well

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:11,779
you see they have some unusual and

00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:16,610
strong opinions and how file system

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:20,600
developers should work with users do you

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:24,410
think babosa some developers should do

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,949
something else to support the linux user

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,699
base yeah I have different in strange

00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:33,499
opinions about working with the people

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,749
who use the colonel who use file systems

00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:38,119
in particular so this is another

00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:39,860
somewhat technical story there's an

00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:43,100
article that expect Lea's about if you

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,420
want to read about it that one else was

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:49,699
very popular but didn't make people

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:53,860
angry so darn well I'm sure made some

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:59,499
people here so the you might remember

00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:03,589
this as the oh ponies argument oh yeah

00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:08,240
so there's this problem back in two

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:10,640
thousand nine when a list Horrible's got

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,579
tired of his laptop going so slowly and

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,909
decided to that he wanted the unsafe

00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:19,309
fast option of ext3 to be the default so

00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:21,020
this right data in such a way that if

00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:23,720
the computer crashes when the computer

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,279
comes back up the file that you were

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,289
writing at the time of the crash might

00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,659
be filled with garbage for might be all

00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:35,179
zeros or it might contain the contents

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:36,740
of sauce / NZ the file where you keep

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,029
all of your angry thoughts about all of

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,010
you have people who use your system

00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:42,110
right it's not safe but Linda's car

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,760
molds decided that you know it was his

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,830
laptop and he didn't care and everyone

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,170
else who needed a safe file system I

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:53,470
could just change the default

00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:57,900
so that was somewhat annoying uh what

00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:01,390
happens next is even more annoying so

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,700
this was sort of course Huett ously bad

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:07,020
that this happened when a crash happened

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,270
with this this particular style of mount

00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,110
the HT three maintainer intento decided

00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,270
at first not to fix this problem at all

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,670
and just too instead make fun of

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,990
application developers who wanted to use

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,700
the file system in a way that didn't end

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,950
up with file garbage and their David

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,990
files when they started in particular

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,000
the problem that was happening a lot is

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,400
that people wanted to update the

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,680
contents of a file atomically you know

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,720
either all the new data is there or none

00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,040
of the new data is there this is

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,990
something you want to do a lot and a

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,420
really safe way to do that is to create

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,420
a new file put in all the new data in

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,970
there and then rename it over the old

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,560
file right and this worked like a charm

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,540
either you would get the old file and it

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,070
was perfectly consistent or you'll get

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,320
the new file and it was perfectly

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,320
consistent to what happened with the new

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,080
world and the new default is that that

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,760
new file could have garbage on your pic

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,050
updated kind of zeros could have two

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,770
concepts with your password file right

00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:15,220
so I wanted to fix this by calling F

00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,260
sink after reading said oh well rename

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,040
it doesn't have that behavior it's not

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,070
defined by POSIX it's merely you know

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:27,280
logical so call essing now the problem

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:29,050
with passing is that it's very slow its

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,610
extreme even slower endings to three

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,380
because it requires every single right

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,390
that was cute to the file system at that

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,310
time to complete before it comes back

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,020
and so if you called s Inc when some

00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,270
other activity was going on it took it

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,670
could take several seconds to come back

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,710
and a bunch of again application

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,660
developers said that's totally

00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,210
unacceptable

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:52,200
have it takes three seconds for people

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,580
to remove a window right so people

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,310
started joking about this and calling

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,800
this the o ponies option to open the

00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,780
open systems system skull and pretending

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,550
like asking for a rename that Avery

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,010
either gave you the old data or than me

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,290
data was like a little kid asking for a

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:11,430
pony at Christmas right you can't have a

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:14,790
pony aah file systems are just not that

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:17,700
reliable so the thing that I really

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,300
remember about this argument was at one

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:24,180
point Ted show was making fun of a woman

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,370
who played tux racer on her desktop i

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,660
believe it was KDE and the thing that

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,670
she would do is she was started que te

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,290
and she rearranged all of her windows to

00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,510
the just the right configuration so that

00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:35,300
she could see everything and that Katie

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:38,130
would try to save that configuration

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,100
using reading and then she would start

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,230
running tech stocks tracer which I don't

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,280
know how many here have run plain tux

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,380
racer Yeah right unfortunately she had a

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,750
buggy video driver and sometimes it

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,490
would crash the computer within a minute

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,440
or something like that starting a tux

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,360
racer whenever that happened all her

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,550
configuration files would get full of

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,470
garbage and she started Kiki again and

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:06,780
her windows wouldn't be in the right

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:08,490
place and this person jumped on this is

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,450
a totally unreasonable thing to expect

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:14,280
look how trivial your your ideas are how

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,350
I can't believe you want to use my file

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,190
system to save your window locations

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:23,850
right and I thought that was really

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,680
obnoxious I really think that just

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,660
because it's hard to influence something

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,100
some sort of data guarantee in the file

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,070
system that's not a good reason not to

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,510
do it so eventually I had to back down

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,210
and actually fix some of the bike

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,800
were causing this behavior to happen but

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,600
I spent a lot of a lot of my articles

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,030
from Linux weekly news are basically

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,640
advocating against this kind of this

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,990
kind of attitude so I'm on the side of

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,880
the people who are using the file system

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,680
because that's almost everyone there's

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,820
only like 12 of us actually writing the

00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:56,610
file system so oh well thank you for

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,550
standing up for the users not only the

00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,820
users but the desktop users in the new

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:05,220
desktop users and hey even the game

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:11,940
players everybody has to start a

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:13,920
solitary for the their experience who

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:20,660
got excited about computers because they

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:24,390
played games right yes okay well

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:28,140
absolutely thanks for doing that pole

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,510
but what what is really my passion is

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,860
that the desktop experience especially

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:37,260
for for the children and one of the

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,880
people who are in the audience today is

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:44,370
um was my mentor Dave Civic who we went

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,630
to go on with computer reach three years

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,840
ago and he's going to give a

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,020
presentation about that later on today

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,350
and even though i was in paid that was

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,280
most definitely my dream job my dream

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:01,710
experience and it's just been a

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:08,430
remarkable journey as to where is it

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:12,290
free software is taking me but in 2008

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:15,330
you were working for red hat as a

00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:18,540
systems developer how cool is that house

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:21,200
in that line so it's funny because when

00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,200
I started working on Linux looking for

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,700
as a kernel developer was just out of

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,070
the question I couldn't imagine ever

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,539
being not good right so it was really

00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,100
exciting to me to get a chance to work

00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,870
for red hat and it was actually as good

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,570
as I thought it was going to be a lot of

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,909
that is because my boss is was Rick

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,440
dealer whose fantastic guy if you ever

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,960
get a chance to work with him do it

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,090
immediately I get to work on upstream

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,830
staff I got to work four days a week

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,289
which was really nice for most of the

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,600
time I weren't there so the big things I

00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:54,649
worked on there was a 64-bit userland

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,590
support for HD for and union meds so

00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:59,630
which was one of the many file systems

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,059
that preceded the overlay FS which is

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,919
now the internal stacking file system

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:09,529
that you should be even so it was a

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:13,010
really good job well okay so why did you

00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:14,360
leave it was fantastic yeah it was

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,669
really hard i spent a lot of time

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,389
wondering why what's wrong with me that

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,610
i'm considering this so actually i had

00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:26,330
been working since for the previous

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:29,120
decade to that about to get more women

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,559
involved in linux right so i started

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,620
with linux tricks when i start working

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,510
on key feminism uh and then i was

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,659
working at my pet and a friend of mine

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,750
it's about five years ago got groped the

00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:43,789
third time in one year at an open source

00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,669
conference and i just got to take it

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:48,350
anymore I real ira membered wow i was

00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:51,440
groped to the conference twice including

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,320
one of the conferences I started and I

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,539
just I just couldn't anymore in good

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,860
conscience encourage women to go into a

00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,510
field where I knew they could be

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,029
physically assaulted if they went to a

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,909
conference so I either had to stop

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:09,019
getting women involved in Linux or I had

00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:11,010
to fix it that's how I felt so I decided

00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:12,690
that I was going to write an example

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,980
Prince anti-harassment policy with the

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,430
help of a bunch of other folks including

00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,870
Beth land and my future co-founder

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,630
killed hear about that a minute Mary

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,120
Gardner and so we did we wrote this into

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,950
harassment policy that is now used by

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,660
hundreds or thousands of conferences

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,270
including entomology and conferences

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,130
it's really amazing there's even a some

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,940
kind of band that has a code of conduct

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:37,440
for their shows so yeah I told my boss

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,000
Rick wheeler thought I was going to do

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,800
work on this for the next few weeks he

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,290
said great go for red hat supports you

00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,730
the whole way and it was really

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,740
successful we launched it a whole bunch

00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,890
of organizations develop adopted it

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,690
right away fitting Ohio Linux best and I

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,100
decided that since it was so successful

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:55,710
I was going to have gone ahead and try

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,180
to work on this full time making open

00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,810
source software more accessible to women

00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,860
I didn't know how he's going to fund it

00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,650
took about eight months before I started

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,770
collecting a salary again but yeah we

00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:10,260
started I decided to I got Mary Gardner

00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,240
to confound co-found with me and she is

00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,150
responsible for the good name the ADA

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,250
initiative named after Ada Lovelace the

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,020
world's first computer programmer

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,470
although many people think it's a DA and

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,910
acronym so or that were in favor of

00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,500
being a programming language which one

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:30,840
did actually write it for about six

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:33,020
months so yeah well II you've had some

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,890
opportunity through the ADA initiative

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:41,520
to schedule some events can you tell us

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:46,260
about the ADA cam and the unconference

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,560
ha's that initiative this prison sure so

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,730
the Anna camp on conference is a

00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,020
women-only conference of about thirty to

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,460
200 people for women involved in open

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,090
Oh Jane culture so that includes things

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,330
like open source software but also

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,000
Wikipedia fan culture opens geo stuff

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,510
things like that and we pioneered a lot

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,610
of interesting things there so we could

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,170
what we borrowed or created the quiet

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,630
room a place where you can go and just

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,070
be quiet line supposed to talk we did a

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,770
really good job make sure everyone's

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,510
food needs were met it's a conference

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,910
many people actually get to eat at the

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,250
conference when they know strange food

00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,580
requirements we had a big focus on

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,750
making sure all the conference's

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:32,010
accessible to people who were in

00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:34,990
mobility devices or more vision impaired

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,670
we did a lot of things like that and as

00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,820
a result a lot of women called this

00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,590
conference of life changing every tag

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,600
was making anything up if I was making

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,160
it up I would ask people to say hey de

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,010
Kamp was life changing but they did it

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,560
without me even asking so great so it's

00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,400
really important oh yes and child care

00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,200
conference child care is really

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,610
important to what's really great is that

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,580
we're seeing a lot of these innovations

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:59,440
at other conferences now like the Linux

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,850
Foundation conferences hike on stuff

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,570
like that Oh excellent i also wanted

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:11,890
thank you for leading the Allies skills

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:15,250
workshop yesterday and took part in it

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:19,180
was absolutely excellent experience very

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:23,380
for everyone involved now this to teach

00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:28,770
as men how to support women in open

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:33,850
source in other areas people usually

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:36,640
focus on teaching women differently what

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:40,540
inspired you to put together this

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,590
workshop well so I'm a systems

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,900
programmer and so I know that it

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,549
that makes sense to optimize the the

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,740
part of the code that's only taking up

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:49,820
two percent of the time executing you

00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,960
should probably look at the part of the

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,330
code that's taking up ninety-eight

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,179
percent of the time so similarly there

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,740
is a survey in 2006 that showed that

00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,900
open source software was about

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,190
ninety-eight percent men and i just

00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,480
realized wow we're not going to change

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,490
anything unless we're getting men

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,529
involved in changing the culture so i

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,570
saw a similar workshop at Grace Hopper

00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:11,179
celebration taught by carolyn Simard who

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,890
is an amazing researcher in this area in

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,409
which people role played out scenarios

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:18,850
which they could take specific action to

00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:21,919
support women and i discovered that most

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:25,100
operating but open-source folks were too

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,950
shy to role play so i changed it to a

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,409
discussion format and we spent a lot of

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,059
time discussing how we might respond in

00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:36,500
a situation and that way we get a lot

00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,850
more a lot more different approaches to

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,320
