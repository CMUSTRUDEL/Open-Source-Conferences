just my background I am by education a

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,780
aerospace engineer not a computer

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,870
scientist I've learned all this myself

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,880
and I digo villified pretty much

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,650
everything I brought don't run Google's

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,670
cloud anymore over the last year and a

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,710
half basically web searches and figuring

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,439
how to do it I'm not a complete

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,070
authority this is just stuff I picked up

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,700
and given Snowden everything I think

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,670
people are interested should they be on

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,739
the cloud or not what's the exposure

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:43,320
you're looking at for your data so d

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,730
google fine I'm talking about being off

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,460
of third party public class if it is

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:55,250
your cloud on your server on your

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,420
property you're still pretty much okay

00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,180
there's nothing fundamentally flawed

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,519
with the technology the problem is much

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:08,070
more much like drm proprietary and other

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:13,680
technologies it's the legal implications

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:18,500
that tend to come around and bite you so

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:28,740
a lot of people who's here use Gmail

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:31,979
Google Docs calendar pretty much most of

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:37,079
us and for a while there was an

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:41,189
excellent choice however these are

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,100
better choices you'll know a lot of

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,810
these are email based email is a special

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,100
case that I'm going to pay particular

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,829
attention to but you know you can run

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,270
step google docs LibreOffice closed in

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,619
own cloud has some collaborative editing

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,540
and you can sync your files without

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:06,030
using something like Dropbox those would

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,340
all be things we want to avoid why

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:16,410
anyone have any ideas why you might want

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:19,410
to avoid might go away because if it's

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:24,090
free you're the product they are making

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:27,510
money off of your data in aggregate our

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,720
data is worth significant amounts of

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,670
money your medical records retail on the

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,280
black market for two hundred dollars a

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:41,250
pop and they're available because not

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,510
everyone is good at security you think

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,940
your doctor is going to be checking

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,330
about thumb drives he's plugging in to

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:54,600
the electronic medical records probably

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:57,989
not and the big companies are better at

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,910
security keeping bad guys out but they

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:06,420
are legally obligated to let certain

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:09,060
other bugs in in the United States we

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,930
have a third party doctrine that was

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,510
establishing law and says that you do

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,090
not have a reasonable expectation of

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:23,340
privacy when you give your data to a

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,110
third party at all the whole you'll

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,600
freeze watch by tation privacy when

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,000
you're going to a changing room or a

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,700
restroom but you don't have it on public

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,950
street they're basically treating all of

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,620
your data off on servers like it's in

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:44,760
public even if you're connecting over

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:47,910
SSL and with that no reasonable

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,250
expectation government agents that

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,519
aren't courts without a warrant can

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,530
issue a stupid Ministry of subpoena and

00:03:52,519 --> 00:04:00,480
request your documents for because I

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,010
feel like it pretty much and there are

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,500
agencies like the drug enforcement

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,019
agencies was pretty much given carte

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,440
blanche to go ahead and subpoena as much

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,780
as they wanted Congress can subpoena

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,630
and if they're just a person with that

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:21,030
power they can abuse it my picture here

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:25,410
j edgar Hoover former FBI director for a

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:28,080
very long time went around the bezel

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,990
expectation of privacy and did things

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,380
like wiretap civil rights leaders he

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,800
files on them blackmail congressman just

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,120
an individual and other individuals

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,610
working for the government can do

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,710
similar things if Snowden can walk

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,210
though off with their secrets someone

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:51,060
else can walk off with your private data

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:56,040
they collected now email is an

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,290
interesting case 1967 us versus cats the

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,420
Supreme Court found it was unreasonable

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,690
in a violation of an expectation of

00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,900
privacy to just put phone taps on public

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:11,070
telephone booths God was convicted for

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:14,250
placing legal gambling bets via pay

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:17,550
phone case would US Supreme Court ruled

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,580
they can't just tap a public telephone

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,050
booth there's an expectation of privacy

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,480
even and this was what the government

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,250
tried to say is because their tablets

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,600
outside the booth it wasn't a search

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,150
they will manipulate the language of

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,570
laws NSA is particularly egregious so

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:43,440
1982 the first standardization of smtp

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:47,270
in an RFC we start getting our email

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,270
working almost no one has a computer

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:53,550
1984 we get the pop protocol for

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,490
downloading your messages from other

00:05:53,550 --> 00:06:01,340
servers 21 you're probably time sharing

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:05,310
on two years later they pass the law

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:08,940
that says emails that are left on a

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,500
third-party server unopened are no

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,120
longer subject to a reasonable

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,830
expectation privacy they are merely

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,470
covered by the third party doctrine now

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,060
that also covers emails that you open

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,210
and

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,680
leave on that third party server so that

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,360
means you open that gmail message on

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,850
through their web interface and by that

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,590
act of opening they can nap search it

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:39,290
and two years later is when we get that

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,510
IMAP protocol we're all using too

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,330
because we're all keeping things up on

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,330
servers now before that space was creamy

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:55,220
so that's the government side security

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,160
wise if you can control the clients you

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,870
can restrict it tighter Google can't

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,419
require that everyone be using an

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:08,030
up-to-date browser that can support TLS

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:10,790
1.2 they have to allow 1.11 and they

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,560
used to laut ssl three because they want

00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:17,060
more compatibility they're making money

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,100
with more users not on your security you

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,800
can choose a bigger key size if it's you

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,610
doing it for devices you own and control

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,330
and can choose how to do it further

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,590
you're a smaller target Lee Google and

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,060
your data is worth less than most

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,050
companies that you can probably do

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,060
better than they're taking off for mal

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,970
actors that aren't government they're

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,130
picking off the slowest guys that have

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,870
data that's worth more than you if you

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,340
can just stay ahead of them you don't

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,030
have to be perfect so long as you're not

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,150
making egregious mistakes but you do

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,850
have to pay attention and it's really

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,190
hard to trust what's good for if

00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,889
anyone's heard debian doing reproducible

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,229
bills they're one of the big problems is

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,940
how do you trust your compiler hasn't

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:06,500
been back doored to produce in fact or

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:12,530
compiler when you're compiling the new

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:14,510
version it's hard and trusting someone

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,210
else is hard and we do that with free

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,539
software all the time but at least it's

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:23,690
open and we can look at the code

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:29,000
reliability google reader i use that it

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,180
shut down lavabit one of Snowden's

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,500
emails carriers

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,840
the government actually did go for a

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,660
warrant and try to take the tls private

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,599
key so they could read everything he

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,520
said no that give me an email I might

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,620
give you Snowden's email specifically

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,500
but not in perpetuity you have to keep

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,030
coming back they said now he shut down

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,390
rather than compromises use your

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,980
security but that meant if you were

00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,770
relying on an email for the next day

00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,730
coming through that out of luck third

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:03,550
party and if they're right in terms of

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,450
service they're writing them to cover

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,100
their backsides against your lawsuit so

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,310
even if it would be reasonable for you

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,720
to sue in a normal course of business

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,170
because you agreed to that long in terms

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:22,450
of service that you don't need you're

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:25,990
stuck but with open source even if it's

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,480
discontinued you still have access to it

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,270
if you can find someone to pay to keep

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,580
working on it while you're transitioning

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,760
is something new that is even an option

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,270
if you have the finances or you could

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,270
learn how to do it but you have the

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:46,000
option to switch slowly also if it's on

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:54,210
your own server you can move at the pace

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,210
that's comfortable for you so how

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:04,279
email to most things we use smtp how it

00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:06,769
moves between the surface now a problem

00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:10,370
with running email at your home you

00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:14,240
probably have and is there's a chance

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:17,500
your ISP may block smtp the port it's

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,560
less common than it used to be because

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:24,769
most people running mail servers have

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,189
spam filters that have the residential

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:30,740
addresses block does do not receive from

00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:32,209
so you have to go through a few hoops if

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,000
you want to use a residential connection

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,100
interestingly i've been running one for

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,110
a year and a half now at home and I've

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,970
rarely gotten spam probably because I'm

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,970
considered a spammer when they look at

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,459
my first MX record my second one is a

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,329
static I'll tell you later how I did

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:53,449
that now when your phone's accessing to

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:56,360
read your emails you're using imap or

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,759
pop most of us use imap because then you

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,750
can access for multiple devices would

00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:04,790
pop downloads locally those are almost

00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:11,149
never blocked and you can pretty much

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:15,500
use it from anywhere email these are

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:20,029
some common solid smtp software you can

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,279
get send mail was a wicked common hard

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:29,300
to configure i recommend not using it if

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:33,579
you're learning or maybe ever postfix is

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,779
very common now free software and

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:38,480
they've done pretty good on security

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:41,209
their config files are on the long side

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:46,819
and there's a bunch of them comp that

00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:49,490
Dida rectory with 10 20 40 a lot of

00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:52,850
options and you might feel bogged down

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,889
under them exims popular really good for

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,110
if you need scale your business probably

00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:03,800
want to look at that one open smt BD is

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,670
from the openbsd guys behind the ssh

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,130
implementation

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,380
let's use they do a lot of privilege

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:15,670
separation solid and the configs are

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:19,580
easy very easy as in 68 lines and

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:23,390
they're clear so I highly recommend that

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,340
if you're trying the first time either

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,780
that or coast mix those are my two

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:31,790
recommendations imap duff got solid

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,730
cyrus works too duff cots been getting a

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,470
lot of attention bug updates or martin

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,540
consistent uh if you need webmail you

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,550
can have a PHP web mail that basically

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:46,130
logs in like your phone's client does

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,600
and you can run it on a server that

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,120
doesn't necessarily have the rest of the

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,670
what the mail on it you probably want to

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,450
separate those for security since those

00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:00,710
are typically PHP apps best for security

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:03,590
to keep them separate brown cube has a

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,020
modern interface for miles kind of

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,690
findings ish but they still are

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:12,790
developing so they're still good to use

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,790
if you're perhaps resource-limited a bit

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:21,010
contacts calendars webdav which is built

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,990
into a patchy but turned off by default

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,900
that's been extended to cart dev and

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,210
caldav this is under the hood with

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,770
google's using anyway so it's just

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:37,400
adding your own back-end debbie calendar

00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:39,620
a decal are both standalone solutions

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,540
where you're implementing just that on

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,930
that single server you're not trying to

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,700
mix other things it is optional installs

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,000
for own cloud can add that to your

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,820
existing own cloud instance staff droid

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,730
is a open source app available on the f

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,010
droid store that can let you use your

00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,610
caldav and carddav servers the

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,790
integrates right with the contacts and

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,360
calendar apps native to android works

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,360
like a charm

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,620
documenting there are other options out

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,300
there but for one you can host and

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,810
that's rather easy to set up and will

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,550
document it owncloud works they don't

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,310
quit have like bubble comments off to

00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:29,300
the side that work well I haven't found

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:37,550
but if you need to do simple ODF work it

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:42,560
can handle it file syncing bunch of

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:45,980
options home club can do it they're

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,830
quite capable I've used it for hundreds

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:53,680
of gigabytes of data between Windows

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:57,680
Linux a bunch of other freebsd systems

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:01,970
but it's a server client type setup so

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,560
the server is where that they both keep

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:10,610
copies of the data and if you are say

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:12,620
keeping a copy for a local user on your

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,790
server perhaps you're doing a file share

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,900
NFS it can be tricky to set up for

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,160
something like that you might want to go

00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:27,890
a sync thing which is a everyone's a

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,810
client tech they both handle of

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,390
provisioning and contract handling so

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:36,860
they can do layer divisions even on the

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,420
xt file system in the event you're not

00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,990
running something that does snapshots or

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,690
something itself you could even roll

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,310
your own doing something with get like

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,070
if you're doing collaborative documents

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,130
and you can afford to not be xml-based

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,750
and go line by line gets a good solution

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,970
for working with other folks and

00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:01,220
thinking your files between different

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:03,650
computers another good multi computer

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,180
sink that offers to a sink is unison now

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,000
you can use our sink and other things

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,520
but these all offer a two-way sink or

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,980
some of them you can set to one way but

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,020
they at least let you for instance i use

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,380
sync thing at home i'll be working on a

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,780
file on my desktop i get up move to my

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,060
laptop by the time I've

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:28,030
woken up my laptop wait a minute or so

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,030
the files right there across the land

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,070
except it's a third party if you're

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,310
running these on your server which is

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:44,980
your property it does have a reasonable

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,980
expectation what if you're using a VPS

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:58,940
unknown it's new and we're not sure

00:16:51,050 --> 00:17:00,710
what's going to happen yeah if it's you

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,220
probably have to keep it encrypted the

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,949
whole time it's on there and in transit

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:10,400
so yeah that would get you around it but

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:14,810
I wouldn't presume it safe with the

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,760
exception of emails going to and from

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,620
unread emails they're just bouncing

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,230
through and not spending too long in on

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,880
their bones do have a reasonable

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:27,170
expectation of privacy they are the

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,170
exception as far as I can tell there is

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:36,200
law statute that requires that they be

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:40,010
considered project file sharing you need

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,160
to share with other folks a web server

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:48,910
works you can actually set up me on if

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:51,380
you're on the land do a NFS or sshfs

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,800
mount to a directory on your web server

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,780
and you can setup password files /

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,240
directory pretty much and just share

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,670
those out if you need to ship a big file

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,480
rather than attaching it to an email

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,220
it's probably a bit nicer because

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,690
everyone can download with the web

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,990
server or whatever client are

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,930
comfortable with or own Club has an

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,920
option for public you know here's a link

00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:19,240
and if you have just the link with the

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,590
specific URL p it'll let you through but

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,930
it kind of is what web servers are meant

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,690
for you could use ftp but I don't like

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,480
FTP because it doesn't work well with

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:38,120
package filtering firewalls so

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:39,710
yeah general questions so I've got kind

00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,450
of a personal setup where I've been to

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,210
China online mail server and something

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,450
I've run into a lot is when I send mail

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,490
out going even though them dkms BF my

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,990
mail gets marked as spam by receivers

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:57,710
okay the way around that problem okay

00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,950
problem is if you have an SMTP server at

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,950
your home network chances are your IP

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:07,880
addresses flybridge residential and that

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:11,480
most spam filters of its particularly

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,549
the spam house one is egregious will say

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,040
everything from these residential

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:20,240
addresses is always family without

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:28,460
looking so the way around that is go

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:31,500
back to come on images

00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:36,270
here the Electronic Communications

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:40,650
Privacy Act does allow because it's not

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:44,280
a left on a server on open for that I

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:48,210
didn't we're here to six months a 180

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:53,280
days by statute if it's unopened on a

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:56,940
third-party server or if it's been

00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,180
opened it's no reasonable expectation

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,240
but before that you did so if you have

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,060
an outgoing server from you what you do

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,130
is you set up a relay on like a VPS with

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,530
a static IP and you can bounce your

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,390
emails right off that and you might even

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,700
set that as your secondary MX in case

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,890
your home internet goes down if you've

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,140
set up as a secondary MX that can catch

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,720
all those emails and you can pretty much

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,690
expect you'll be up in 180 days it's

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,450
somewhere be able to update your MX for

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,520
primary MX and you'll send a bond so you

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,590
don't have any emails bouncing back and

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,830
forth they'll all come to that server

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:40,350
any wood under statute at least have a

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:43,510
reasonable expectation next question

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:50,620
add to that when you're when you're when

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:52,450
you need to relay server 20 slide things

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,840
but there are some services out there

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:59,490
where you can be for relaying so many

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,490
emails per month or per year

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,900
and that would be probable that you'd

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,179
have a reasonable hour station

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,100
expectation privacy would have a case in

00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:19,750
court if some if the government violated

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:22,809
that and actually what i do is i have a

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,140
five-dollar VPS a month up on digital

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:29,140
ocean that's what I use for it it's

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,420
pretty comparative to that and I can do

00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:35,380
a few things like check whether my

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,540
websites are working off so can use it

00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,120
from excuse running it under for a

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,770
couple home emails do you break out

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:48,040
laughing everything you read about till

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:51,090
we either someone hasn't told Congress

00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:56,679
about houses Evans do backups or

00:21:51,090 --> 00:22:05,320
someone's very incompetent perhaps on a

00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:07,900
security it's probable that you are

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,910
right i mean the top secret the methods

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,010
we use for taking care of top secret

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,590
information pretty much our public

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:19,330
they're basically use a EES with big d

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:20,770
sizes like you that the technology that

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,160
they're using is not fundamentally

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,800
different but the choice to use it I

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,120
don't know but since there is statutes

00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,470
that if you're doing work for the

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,740
government where you don't belong to

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,270
them just like when you're doing work as

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:38,790
an employee or email swung to your

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,790
employer if you're using their email

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:52,340
what about using these services um yeah

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,190
if you're connecting to a peer network

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,140
like say say say someone else is running

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:04,630
the same kind of stuff yeah if some

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:08,120
other individual friends probably not

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:10,580
family first degree nuclear family

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,320
probably you have a reasonable

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:17,090
expectation I that probably not covered

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:25,159
by the third party friends might be like

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:29,600
it's even pushing that services hosted

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:31,610
outside US Pacific if you're on a

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,950
service outside the US is certain that

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:38,390
the NSA is looking closer I'm if they're

00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,750
doing encryption right they're doing

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,200
encryption right but it's a third party

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,120
and you can bet they're sucking but then

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,890
again you know they may be routing

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,890
through GCHQ if you're in the US so

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,240
you'd say you got to do it right ten of

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,549
a problem and you have to do it yourself

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,600
because they won't let anyone else do it

00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:06,640
for you even for the right price

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,640
unfortunately any other questions

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,250
okay so if you're using a third-party

00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:30,220
VPS basically you've done all the setup

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:34,560
it's been your or your effort basically

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:39,610
they're just providing hardware uh I

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,830
really it's hard to say my guess is they

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,380
might push it in that they would

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,480
probably say that the blocks of data on

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,310
the server count is a business record

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,460
which is how they're doing it all of

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:53,650
these laws came from prohibition they

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,600
were trying to get the lobsters via

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,580
money laundering so they said you have

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,170
no reasonable expectation of privacy as

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,090
to your savings and checking accounts

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:10,650
things that we consider most private and

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:14,380
it's all cascaded from that questions

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:16,690
all right if you're not interested you

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,150
can go ahead and leave otherwise I'm

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:21,100
going to demo roundcube and uncloudy

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,670
here for folks that want to see the

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,670
interfaces

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,590
I'm sorry

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,740
I have a script mistakes a lot of gist

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,740
of Defense

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:57,760
so this is just a local setup I did last

00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:00,730
night that the demo user no real

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,290
security not https or anything I have a

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:09,130
real one at home but I wasn't going to

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:11,320
count on connectivity here yeah zooming

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,810
should work although i'll note home

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,820
cloud has been a little bit imperfect

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:20,590
about text riding over other texture

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:22,180
icons I don't know if as much could be

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:27,970
down the side from Lord else would be

00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:29,590
nice but so you know basically these

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,360
documents you could have them sink to a

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,310
folder you can do partial sinks of these

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,970
folders for your file system they have

00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:40,210
clients that run for linux desktops and

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:47,800
windows boxes probably mattress too so

00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:50,140
whatever you so you have documents you

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,570
know these apps they have a basically an

00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,740
app store setting but when I download

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:59,830
the files drop them in the right

00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:03,810
directory like a lot of PHP apps so you

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:07,270
get a calendar go ahead

00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:10,480
great events and this calendar you can

00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,790
have sync to your math using evolution

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,190
or Cape Kitty's calendar or whatever

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:23,230
they'll work fine I have had trouble

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:26,260
with contacts if you're using the

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,390
lightning extension for thunderbird has

00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:31,420
some restrictions on like the number of

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,370
gluteus email addresses it started

00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,650
clipping them randomly based on which

00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,090
one was last in deleting them to my

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,950
other ones in a two-way sync setup

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:42,610
although i'll note that was within

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:45,160
earlier version of the tool a sink which

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:53,770
might have been fixed by now i gave up

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:59,620
the Sonia make a contact the multiple

00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:04,720
document editing so basic rich XD kinda

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:07,690
ODF documentas are here I wrote one line

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,850
here was a i wrote as the root user and

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,030
the other i wrote as the demo user and

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,680
you just have kind of a share you can

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,950
other users on the system you can have

00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,630
this box there's a way to federate these

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,390
although that would kind of break

00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,060
through third parties problem which is a

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,900
probe in law although it should we know

00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,060
that justice Sotomayor did mention in a

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:34,030
concurrency to a previous opinion that

00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:36,970
the Supreme Court may look at revisiting

00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:40,870
the third party doctrine but that is not

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:42,820
law yet so you're not protected anyway

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,680
you got this a share like and you can

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,770
drop that into an email to the document

00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:53,850
someone with the link and open it or

00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,850
download it rather so that's own cloud

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,800
roundcube so this is your gmail

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,740
replacement if you need it web access of

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,660
course same OPSEC problems of your on

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:18,070
the strange computer where you didn't

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:22,040
bother to configure your own client so

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:30,830
email it doesn't look terrible though

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:38,780
looks like we're clipping and stupid

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:40,340
over school um so does anyone have

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:58,850
anything they'd like to see you besides

00:29:40,340 --> 00:30:01,090
these and other questions so when

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,610
someone sends you a invite to a Google

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,040
effect from their Google Calendar

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,620
typically you get the ICS file with that

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,180
invite and you can just import that like

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,640
you would to a local calendar on the

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,720
local machine and if the local calendar

00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,210
you picked is the one that you're

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:22,600
syncing with Cal dev it'll sink right up

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:22,600
