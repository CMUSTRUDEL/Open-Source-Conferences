windows OS X using either dr. toolbox or

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,830
glue to dr. which is sort of an older

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,040
generation of that same functionality

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,250
and if you want to look at their user

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,650
guide on dr. slump website and it's a

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:24,660
really good tutorial that walks you

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:26,519
through a bunch of a cake topper ok good

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,890
that demonstration any questions there

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,769
is one other wedge called branch or go

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,100
west retro that's ok nature boys yeah it

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,100
sits there and like a project to comment

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,460
and for time it's it's just a pure metal

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,800
ok tacky understand what's different

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,420
from rye bread is that not only they sit

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,059
there they have containers for the user

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,250
apps they have containers for the system

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:57,180
apps do ok I've just learned about a new

00:00:52,250 --> 00:01:00,809
specialized scaled-down OS metro or

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,059
retro called rancher with the rancher

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,450
boys sorry around your OS which

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,400
essentially allows not only user waste

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,890
containers to run vertex functionality

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,350
of the OS and Musa a lot goes into

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:19,130
intricate into containers never system

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,900
like like a lawyer is a container I

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,580
things like that yeah so services within

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,280
the operating system itself are moved in

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,119
to contain yourself good so that's let's

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,960
go to a lack of iteration here and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,960
hopefully you'll get this demonstration

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,600
okay I'm running on a laptop and you may

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,729
want to wonder what version of linux and

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,979
running and just to clarify that I'm

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:58,340
running Linux Mint 17 on my laptop

00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,189
that's that's my hopes to us okay and I

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,880
have two windows open both are both what

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:09,140
these are running on the same same OS or

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,090
so to speak source or sisters let's bit

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:18,709
17 ok the first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:21,290
and show you the base level command that

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,440
you used almost for everything doctor it

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,900
is guess what after it takes a number of

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,730
arguments and we'll be looking several

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,400
time but if you just talk dr. by itself

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,250
you'll show you all the things that you

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,630
can do by talking by typing dr. followed

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,120
by one of these things may be a

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,160
arguments under arguments etc you can

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,349
you know create servers you can log in

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,319
you can follow the server delete to sir

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:48,140
Delita container etc and you can pull it

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,690
pull an image vulnerable Tory can push a

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,470
container and there's currently stands

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,410
into an image location etc lots of

00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:01,329
things here just installed play around

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:07,040
and just look this will be instructive

00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:12,200
now one of the things that one of the

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,940
useful tasks that that that that we can

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,100
do with the doctor command is find out

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:21,549
what containers that are running this

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,549
command

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,769
okay that there should be there should

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,189
be it I have config doctor sir there

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,459
should be an interface named dr. Cyril

00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,459
let's see

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,470
alright no means the demo from stalling

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:41,940
okay well let's see it should be

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:44,220
installed on this so many times I was I

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,170
was kind of chuckling in my previous

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,950
session here when the guy was not a

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:59,610
problem with his dead I've just did mine

00:04:49,950 --> 00:05:04,110
so many times the problem kiss my okay

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:08,360
it's a stall here offered on Iowa why

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,360
didn't dr. service didn't start up

00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,899
arnotts dr dot io

00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:45,210
okay that's try starting it should work

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,860
ah it's good at wicked sorry i'm not

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:52,770
sure what happened why the doctor even

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:57,030
was in straight state hey so if you

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:59,040
notice here it is showing a table which

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,860
is too big to fit on my screen so it

00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,400
wraps around here with the name of the

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,690
containers the image that it is running

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,390
what command is running inside the

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,710
container etc etc right now there's

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,080
nothing there's nothing running my

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:23,040
system so so it's a pretty boring

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:26,160
situation let's dry I tried variant of

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,230
this command which is which says showing

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,190
all the campaign so we continue that are

00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:34,740
running the past and you can see over

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,110
here our history of the waste containers

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,390
that I was playing with as long

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,030
yesterday and that's a try so setting up

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,810
for this demo here notice each each

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,360
container has a container ID and that's

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:53,460
that's how you name or identify the

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,970
container here it also has a more human

00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,110
friendly name and that name is generated

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,700
on the fly by the doctor system so this

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:06,270
container was given the name trusting

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,000
Heisenberg this dollar container was

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,340
given the name half passive past year I

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,200
had picked these names at the doctors up

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,710
50 names so I could either refer to the

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:22,860
cut container by his ID or I could refer

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:25,530
to it by its Ilyasova speed and I was

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,790
running centos black container and the

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,390
past I've been running who would you

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:33,540
like containers now there are a number

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:36,380
of images that are available in the

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,750
doctor repository which is called

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,030
her up which is on the internet and i've

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,060
downloaded many of them for my oh my

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:47,000
laptop here if I talk to come and dr.

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:50,750
images that shows me all the various

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,870
images that I can instantiate in

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:58,310
containers various flavors of a good to

00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:01,670
hear there's a scent all seven I have

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,190
engine act somewhere to as a container

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,890
image right I did at least I thought of

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,800
it or anything anyway you can download

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,620
so these this is my local copy of my

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,960
image repository now I'm going to run

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,890
one of these images in a container so

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,160
this is the first time I'm actually

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:28,670
running starting entertainer I'd say dog

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,730
or run oops hi and take a couple of

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:38,510
arguments here and I want to run the

00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:41,919
blue to image and and then I have to say

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,530
what am I going to run in pac-12 image

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:53,330
so just for fun let me just type up the

00:08:45,530 --> 00:09:01,580
phone books i'm not i just type cat / l

00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:03,830
SD /f EDC / LSB dash release so it's

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,580
going to what it's going to do here is a

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:10,550
fart take an image of blue tube loaded

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:13,510
into a container get to set up the

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,550
container for all the resources it needs

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,620
set up Nick's etc on the container get

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,420
an IP address further for the Nick on

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,360
the container and start up their

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,480
container and run the command that I

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,970
said which in this case is kat ellis and

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,310
ç and let's be released so what's a

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,130
chicken being able to get you should

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,860
sherwood to tell you so let's do that

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,960
here there comes notice how fast that

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,820
happened and they said then you start up

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,820
in Tenzin

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,650
seconds try try doing something like

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,240
this on a bee in Italy tens of seconds

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:54,180
message so notice the pendant what is

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:59,350
put out it is it a good to LSB release

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:02,310
take their contents there now if I go

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,580
back and see on my on my post on my

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:10,620
system what what what containers are

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,670
running you would think that that

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,040
container that I just turn it up is

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,980
running no it's not and the reason is it

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,200
ran it did what it was asked to do which

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,270
is to cap m / Pepsi staff has been

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,970
released and appended it stopped so it's

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:31,690
not not not running right now fine do

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:35,260
dr. ps- day you will see in the history

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:38,500
we're back here somewhere oh right right

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:41,500
here is there was a container that ran

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:45,580
that rank at a low speed Brad 56 seconds

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,580
ago and it had given is given a alias of

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,710
jolly brown recently so it did read run

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,450
that's an evidence that it ran if you

00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,820
saw the output of it it's not no longer

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,840
run for working but let's let's make it

00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,780
more persistent for intersex so we'll

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:06,990
run the same command except this

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:09,820
volcanic etsy had us p / release we will

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,730
run slash bin slash bash this gives me

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,590
an interim okay look how fast that came

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,130
up here so it's part of a container

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:23,700
starter starting bash on it and the name

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,700
of that container is this awful thing

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,060
okay I think I go back to my and I'm

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,380
logged into that container right there

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:37,880
if I go back to my host OS and I said

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,100
dr. PS and now it's showing that it's

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,120
running not particularly and if you look

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:48,230
at the name here 90 that matches what

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,860
you see has in the inner pronto and it

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:56,350
shows to give this name prickly Thompson

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:59,690
so it's running slash bin slash bash so

00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,440
and so I have a blue to lack environment

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:07,220
so let me explore this a little bit and

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,760
let me look i'm logged in currently as

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,590
root you could go in there long as a

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,290
less privileged user but this is the way

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,180
that my demo set up the file system

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,950
structure looks like just like the root

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:34,970
filesystem our annual bluetooth system

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:41,030
here and i'm going to yeah just to

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:42,710
verify LSB release here we are running

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,840
for glued to here which is different

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:49,640
from what my hostess which is practical

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:53,210
inexpensive matter now let me also

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:57,380
explore what processes are running in my

00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:00,710
container so i type PS aux which you'd

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,250
list let's see what's really on the host

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,480
of us with them yes aus and it's you

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,340
know there are several pages of

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,040
processes running on campus on this

00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:15,440
machine let's do the same thing on on

00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:21,560
the container okay then two processes

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:24,320
running one is a such good set bash

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,589
which is which I stirred it up and two

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,610
is the second process was my PS command

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,459
that's all there is running on this

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,509
machine there's no no maladies such as

00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:38,999
Kron syslog and the things are running

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:40,860
it this is just a shrimp down version of

00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:43,139
the West if you want them you can

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,050
install them and London this this is

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:50,879
showing you that containers contain just

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:53,579
minimal stuff again now also notice that

00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,029
the process ID of slash bin slash Bash

00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:00,920
is PS what one what does process ID one

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:05,579
of most unix and linux sisters in it ok

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,639
so it's running hunt is running on my

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:11,579
host and there is a process ID one on my

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,189
host but process ID one on in this in

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,939
this container environment is not

00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:19,860
pointing to process ID one on my own

00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,019
micro system analysis there's a separate

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,959
process namespace so you can have the

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:28,499
same process IDs across containers

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:32,369
across hosting systems etc ok thank you

00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:35,369
yes somebody had yeah I'm question yet

00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:40,829
with guess so if you start up say for

00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:42,420
example file manager in a docker and you

00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,519
look at your hard drive does that mean

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,589
you have access the group on your hard

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,769
drive well right now i'm logged in as

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,929
root right now in a more production

00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:54,839
environment your limit of religious your

00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:57,029
blog Anna's but for the purposes of this

00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,949
demo I just have to plug dentistry and

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:06,629
whatever privileges you have you're only

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:10,290
seeing here the file system that's

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,299
that's pertinent to the container it is

00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,060
different for the hosts file system and

00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:17,450
military

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:22,910
putting on the hard problem yes yes can

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:25,160
I see the results of a night oh yeah

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,019
sure sure that does actually come in

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,029
with in my desert can hold out for that

00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:48,740
but her yeah oh you have my teeth yeah

00:15:32,029 --> 00:16:01,760
sure let's try okay let's try it that's

00:15:48,740 --> 00:16:05,180
awesome Oh bin slash bash okay I'm

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,269
longing to have a centos container

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,370
running again here and that's the

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:18,620
default prompt that it gives me and to

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:21,279
verify that it sent to us I ok so i have

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,320
a circus container and i have a good

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,410
okay i'm going to exit this because like

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,170
I'm running out of internal space here

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,519
it's Oscar to make it back to my stream

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,209
and hopefully the answer some of your

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,899
questions that just came up here so my

00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:42,199
host operating system if I I'm not get

00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:43,850
as user wrong and if i grep this in the

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,910
password file guess what there's by

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,220
entering the password file on the guest

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,380
container or boo to that I to start up

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,380
let me run the same command here

00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:09,280
oh there it was I read your letter I'll

00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,620
run it again okay that there is no user

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,260
rock that it has a song user database

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,570
there right now it put it probably only

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:22,090
has root and maybe a few things we can

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:24,280
look at what let's see what's it so as I

00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:27,760
mentioned earlier the user name space is

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:34,420
different across containers and most

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:37,750
operating systems oh yes I guess oh all

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:41,670
right okay there are several things here

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:47,550
but we'll use the roms came okay

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,550
somebody asked about networking ok

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:59,880
that's the IP either show what's the

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:03,370
name of the nick here in a chair with ok

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,840
so i'm looking at eth0 on the container

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:15,660
and and the IP address assigned to it is

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,660
that 172 1703 let me do the same thing

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,890
every to do the same thing on them on

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:26,350
the host operating system IP a derp show

00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:30,700
and in this case it's going to be

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,380
talking through doctors room and let's

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:38,770
see where is the address here here at

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:41,410
years 172 17 42 dot 1 which is different

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:46,240
from from this it's kind of different

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:49,390
and show you that this is even relevant

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,570
let's try actually digging this yeah I

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,120
can see they're in the same zone so you

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:59,260
know well I'm thing it just just like

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:04,570
you have you see that it's it's a 16 bit

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:07,090
wide subnet source so what's happening

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,299
here is the host operating system is now

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:18,779
pinging the IP stand

00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:20,820
inside the container now just add one

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,249
other thing to show you and that is how

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,950
the file systems of share in a color

00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:31,139
today so let's go to the root file

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,749
system in the container and I just show

00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:38,009
it to you here's what's in that your

00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:41,460
file system let me just create a file in

00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:44,850
the root filesystem not all oh boy image

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,669
before I do that I'm going to show you

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:51,059
where that root filesystem map sent you

00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:57,090
in the file system of the host and and

00:19:51,059 --> 00:20:00,090
that would be first I need to know they

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,919
can fluke container ID in this case I

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,389
need the really long name for the

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,580
container ID the short thing just

00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,409
doesn't work so i'm going to say dr.

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,529
inspect which gives me a whole lot of

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:12,720
information about the container and the

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:16,009
name of the container i forgot already

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,009
with the name of the spectators

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,600
never prickly Thompson

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,309
why does not complain inspector

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,190
ok dr. expect for it to Thompson and I'm

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,560
going to grab for just one field in

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,410
there because it there is living lines

00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:03,150
of information that's a full container

00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:06,300
ID which is kind of nothing but let me

00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:09,860
use that to actually explore the file

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:12,330
system on the host to show you where the

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:18,270
container files are located on the host

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:24,870
events so I'm going to do sue do LS /

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:33,330
bar LED darker aufs mount and I need the

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:36,840
container ID now okay so what I'm

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:42,270
looking at is the root file system on

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,820
which is there on for the doctor

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,890
entertainer as it is mirrored in the in

00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,440
the as it shows up in the file system of

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,260
the host so just to make sure that we're

00:21:49,440 --> 00:22:01,740
actually looking at that let's let's

00:21:52,260 --> 00:22:04,500
just do a touch a file here and do so I

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,690
created a file called aya limits which

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,480
didn't exist before and i created this

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:13,910
in the root file system of my container

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,410
now let me repeat this LS command before

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,030
and guess what just up here is that no

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:22,230
hi Alex so it's the it's a

00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:24,990
self-assessment Thatcher so that's

00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,300
anywhere close to out on time so I'd be

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,010
happy to take a few questions but

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,800
hopefully this is giving you a flavor

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,020
for for what containers are all about

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,210
this is just touch the service there

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,580
were lots of talks here that meant much

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,210
deeper than this but hopefully you can

00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,659
get play with this in your free time and

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:44,729
and

00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:46,879
and actually have something now some

00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:56,070
basis to have all this information yes

00:22:46,879 --> 00:23:01,379
persistent question was is the container

00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:03,869
persistent or not it wasn't because at

00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:07,349
the time you remember I ran captain

00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:09,090
headless beat I'm running bashing there

00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:11,399
so that containers still there if I talk

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:15,479
exit in bash that container will go away

00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:20,580
in attempt to me in simple islands I

00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:23,450
will go away yeah let's do that ok I'm

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:31,799
going to exit my container here and

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:33,599
let's look at this year ok now if you if

00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,029
you want it to be persistent then you

00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,529
got to run something in it that that's

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:42,659
something and keeps doing something in

00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:46,739
there but anyway yes sir sure for

00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:54,629
example how does it map either i need to

00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:55,979
file ok I wish I happy here I could have

00:23:54,629 --> 00:24:02,460
looked at that before I flew that

00:23:55,979 --> 00:24:04,769
container away in in the in the

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,369
container whoever created that five

00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:10,950
phones at 5am human continue yes what

00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:14,090
does it back to mommy ok let's cry

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,090
that's right

00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:36,350
on the container since I was through its

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,049
own bathroom right now fortunately the

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:42,590
container ID has changed and so I got to

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:48,710
figure that out give me a head I first

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:53,740
want a suit okay the container is not

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,740
tender bread cake so let's go back

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,600
finding container ID for that

00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:14,100
okay I have an ID for that now and now

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,100
let me look at the

00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,870
okay so there is the file

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,880
you

00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:20,899
okay this is rude on the host ill owns

00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,899
owns that file

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,410
if you can start a container as a

00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:39,330
different ID right

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,880
yeah i'm going to start the container

00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:45,330
with a patch that was now non-root

00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:49,080
dinner in which case the file I created

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:51,480
would have been owned by whatever ID on

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,100
that container how it would show up here

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,290
I don't know how to try them but it

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:59,100
would not probably not be rooted I don't

00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:06,060
know try it's not that difficult giving

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:08,540
up any other questions well thank you

00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,540
