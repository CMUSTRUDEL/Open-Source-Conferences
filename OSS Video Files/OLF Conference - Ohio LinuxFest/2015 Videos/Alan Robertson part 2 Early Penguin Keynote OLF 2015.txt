	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
and she's a friend of mine I used to

00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,500
work with but she's been a stay-at-home

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,359
mom for the last 15 years how many

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,160
people think a person who's been not in

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,540
the software market for 15 years is

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,009
going to be able to get a job very

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,199
easily today nobody raises their hand I

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,080
think that's the right answer so I was

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,430
talking to her and and she said you know

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,830
I really want thinking about going back

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,269
to work sorry about that it's just it's

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,260
not that so much that parrot off as much

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,890
that as it is that I need your password

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,440
write it on this piece of paper and and

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,050
so I I said why don't you come right

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,399
some software for my project and she

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,750
said oh like cuz then you'd have

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,780
something on your resume that says i'm

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,000
not totally obsolete right and so she

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,829
did that and she hasn't decided to go

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,660
back to work yet she's really kind of

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,370
ambiguous about what ambivalent whether

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,110
she wants to do that or not but it's the

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,430
kind of thing she can do to get things

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,800
on her resume that that that will enable

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,899
her to find a job without coming in as a

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,329
you know first level low level type

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,049
person right that she's actually

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,439
contributed to non-trivial projects and

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,390
software I'll try and just talk I'll

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,130
just try and touch the button more often

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,979
and I'm getting you're going to run out

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,979
of time in here pretty soon anyway I

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,350
think I have a bow to the next thing I

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,500
think I'm supposed to be out here

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,200
official yet always until today after

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,210
well I so this talk is so the good news

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,920
for you guys is in this talk is not

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,170
going to go over time this is not a long

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,390
talk now I wish I could just save that

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,479
time for my other talk because my other

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:50,880
talk we'll go over time if I let it so

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,320
okay now i have to remember how to sew

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,869
this is my career i talked about that

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,729
Ryan talked about the other stuff so so

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,740
why from the perspective of the world

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,170
why would you want to do this because

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,090
you can improve computing for everyone

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,399
you contribute to the world in a way

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,489
that other people benefit from it is

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,890
humbling and awesome to me as somebody

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,690
who says so I had a guy who emailed me

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,920
true story and said you know I've never

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,030
really emailed you on the mail

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,920
this before but I wanted to tell you

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,220
I've done my hundredth install of the

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:27,000
Linux H a package and I said wow that's

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,349
impressive you know that that kind of

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,050
stuff you realize that what you've done

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:34,260
actually matters it mattered to somebody

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,640
now it helps Mike my career and you know

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,650
I do a lot of things to keep my life

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,910
going but it helped his life and there

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,350
are thousands probably a hundred

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,450
thousand systems over the world that

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,550
have installed this stuff and it's like

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,130
it's used in places like the German FAA

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,410
Fort our operations and all kinds of

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,970
places right people use this stuff and

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:55,440
and it's just it has improved I'm not so

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,049
much bragging about what I did but I'm

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,940
saying what you can do when you do it is

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:03,090
that your contributions can have the

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,010
same kinds of effects sharing a

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,489
collaboration raises the bar for

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,080
everyone and not only is improved dollar

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,680
work but it may be improves dollar work

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,600
n where n is in n plus 1 right improves

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,799
where you're going improves the one of

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,650
the interesting things if you contribute

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,000
to an area then find it some you know

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,280
when you want to find the next job find

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,440
somebody to that's really important go

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,590
there they will really like having you

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,989
around and it makes projects viable

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,859
people who use open source projects make

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:40,500
them viable a project with has no users

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,560
is not viable a project which has no

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,390
contributors isn't very valuable so you

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,820
contribute to the livelihood in the

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,859
lifeblood of these projects by doing

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,970
this and in turn you've received so much

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,340
you have recent any people think they've

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,760
received a lot to open source the use of

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,230
open source software in their lives and

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,560
think how much you've received this

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,350
allows you the chance to give back give

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,970
back to the people who given to you with

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,910
you know without having any idea who you

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:16,620
are right to give as you've received so

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,030
I talked it as I I forgot about that

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,320
slightly I said I knew what the exercise

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,720
was well I forgot about that one so

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,539
anyway go on relevant to work so the

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,710
other things you want to look at is you

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,780
would look you want to look for a

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,610
project that has an open community

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,139
some places are open source in the sense

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,330
of we write the software when we throw

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,690
it over the wall and it has the let GPL

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,900
license on it and have a nice day there

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:43,919
is a company whose whose whose symbol

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,930
used used is is hats and they you know

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,600
you might know the one I mean and they

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,730
used to be very much guilty of that not

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,290
so much anymore to some degree they

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,120
still are but they used to be very

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,380
guilty of yeah it's open source but we

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,150
don't let anybody contribute to it it

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,230
doesn't it doesn't get brought up a

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,760
check from us so whatever the project is

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,620
regardless who contributes to it and I

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,770
wouldn't say that that company today is

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,380
that way on all their projects but you

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,790
see some of it still you want to look

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,500
for an open community and the open

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,419
source is not the same as open community

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,580
our community means people they welcome

00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,280
people to come contribute you want to

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,710
look for one that's viable or active

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,990
cool that you get off on you say oh this

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,919
is so awesome which for example my

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,260
assimilation project is awesome and and

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,210
and friendly to newbies a lot of places

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,830
are really friendly to newbies and some

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,479
are not some are not and you want to

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,330
look at any or all of cool and exciting

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,100
and important you know if you can get

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,690
all of these things at once manage your

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,860
your gut your golden but these are the

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,380
things you want to look for these ones

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,580
do you think I want to think about so

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,320
the question is what do you want to do

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,000
to contribute to them well documentation

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,140
anybody think that they know of an open

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,440
source project which has too much

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,440
documentation

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:12,460
anybody think that they have to higher

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:14,200
quality documentation so so that's

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,390
that's a place to start because the

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,220
thing is I told you that with the guy

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,640
who wrote the documentation for linux AJ

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:31,860
I was so I cannot tell you how grateful

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:33,790
I was for the work he did yes hello so

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,780
let me tell you how that worked by the

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,190
way so we had a mailing list and I had

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,830
written some was like really kind of

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,270
half half baked that's where that's

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,720
polite er more polite half-baked

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,130
documentation and and and he said I take

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,240
it over so he took it over you know

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,460
started with it and he wrote better

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,140
stuff and every time somebody asked a

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,820
question on the mailing list I would

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,440
answer it and I'd tell him could you put

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,560
those the documentation and he did and

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,050
you could measure the results the number

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,980
of questions went down and down and down

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,800
and down and went and and all of a

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,940
sudden the documentation worked because

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,680
C documentation needs to work it doesn't

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,130
need to be pretty it doesn't need to be

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,780
elegant it needs to work it needs to

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,430
funky perform its function which is to

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,310
say keep people from bugging the

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,810
maintainer about questions and that's

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,590
how you can tell it works and his

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,700
documentation worked and this is so I've

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,720
just answered the question which I was

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,850
going to do anyway on the mailing list

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,230
and I would see see him and say could

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,850
you put this in the document could you

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,780
fold this in the documentation he would

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,910
find out a place to put in the

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,020
documentation and then nobody would ask

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,400
that question again because it would

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,980
read the documentation and it had

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,370
questions answers to questions that

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,840
people actually asked you know that's

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,040
the that's how you could tell what it

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,970
needed to be in it was because of the

00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,650
questions people asked and you can

00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,090
answer questions on the mailing list

00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,440
even if the document you don't wanna

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,790
update documentation somebody asked a

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,010
question say all you do that by doing

00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,690
blah blah blah blah maybe you want to

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,490
update the documentation or maybe it

00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,650
says that already and you can point them

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,060
at it politely and nicely because i

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,060
think i'm not a fan of

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,110
yeah I'm a fan of reading the manual but

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:24,190
I'm not a fan of telling people giving a

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,390
me finger while I while I how many

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,610
people think they've got any finger from

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,770
the system sometime yeah I've gotten it

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,850
me too everybody gets he finger from the

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,800
system sometimes that's one of the air

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:40,120
noses I'm sure it's in the pan to find

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:43,390
somewhere and do great bug reports to

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,000
write great bug reports there's nothing

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,820
it's like I had a bug for example that

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,280
went on for years and it went like this

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,420
every time every time you move an IP

00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,160
address from here to there it takes five

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,660
minutes for it to show up and I said

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,860
what kind of routers do you have I don't

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,050
know I said you know what brand are they

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,930
well I'm not sure I don't do that

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,250
working and so I just knew that out

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,620
there somewhere there were some people

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,240
occasionally who had trouble with IP

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,370
addresses moving over and taking a long

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,660
time to show up even though I know that

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,700
we moved them over in seconds and

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,100
everybody else saw this behavior one day

00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,520
I got some Japanese guys and I'm going

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,080
to be a little i'll tell you how i hear

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,970
it in my head when I heard them all mr.

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,410
Robertson we are so sorry to tell you

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,700
that we find this bug in your software

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,140
and we are so sorry to tell you that

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,670
this RFC here and here and here

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,870
describes how you should be doing it

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,490
we're so sorry to give you this patch

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,410
that fixes it and we apologize for

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,970
intruding on your life and telling you

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,800
these things then my reaction was I'm

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,030
going to put that patch in so fast it

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,030
will make your head spin

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,369
and one of the Europeans had not heard

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:52,559
that thing he says oh I like that making

00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:53,399
your head spin right and one of the cool

00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,559
things that happens about

00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,779
internationally to is is one day I a guy

00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,029
had a problem and I put out a patch and

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,649
I I put it and I was exhausted i put it

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,939
to put it in the system and i went to

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,920
bed and went to sleep and got up late

00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,689
the next day and I had an email apology

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,670
from the guy apologizing taken so long

00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,199
to test it because he was in Europe it

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,899
had taken him all day to get into the

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:17,429
bug to fix the to put the patch in that

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:21,809
he given who says no problem i was

00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:23,309
asleep then man sometimes time zones are

00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:28,470
your friends most the time not but

00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:30,869
sometimes they are and so right great

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,509
bug reports that was a great bug report

00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:36,389
it tells me not only what was wrong how

00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:38,550
to fix it what the RFC was to reference

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,579
to tell me why what i was doing wasn't

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,350
adequate right it's like oh my goodness

00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:46,589
i've never gotten a bug report i love

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,199
more than that ever and make suggestions

00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:50,850
you know this is really cool but

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,749
wouldn't it be even cooler if we did

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,910
that oh I never thought about that I

00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:58,049
never oh that's a really cool idea why

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,420
don't we do that and sometimes it's

00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,369
really simple to do and sometimes it's

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,350
hard and sometimes it's like when I went

00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:07,339
to a land on linux users group and I

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,529
said yeah get this problem with deciding

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:14,009
people not knowing how to set their

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,799
timeouts for dead time you know how

00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:18,119
light they should set when you send

00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,399
heartbeats how long I should wait before

00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:22,049
declaring a machine dead weather since

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,279
the last heartbeat i heard i have no

00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,829
idea how to do that and people would say

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,389
i don't know how many i do it the guys

00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:30,480
just suggest why don't you have a

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,860
warning time did you set maybe twice as

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,990
high as they want for dead time and set

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,299
the real dead time high and then you can

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,850
figure out how what the worst case you

00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,470
get on a warning and and then you can

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,749
set the dead time twice as high as that

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,879
I said oh that's obvious and it took me

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:47,449
I don't know two hours to put in the

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:50,040
code so when I can't got home I but I

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:52,620
don't think I did it that night at the

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,819
hotel but i did it with other than that

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,300
night at the hotel in the next night

00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:59,160
when i was home

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,880
you can you can become a reference site

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,770
if you will agree to let them say I we

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,010
use this stuff and we love it there's

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,930
that there is nothing you know all you

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,760
do is use it and say yeah we use it be

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,560
willing to say that be willing to be the

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,560
person who stands up and says yeah these

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,960
people use it and it's great that helps

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,010
people get trust in it how many people

00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,330
think that you ought to just trust in

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,460
the old open source project you run

00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:28,830
across now me neither by the way I don't

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,510
either how do you decide to trust it

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,430
well you look at the mailing list you

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,890
look at that you look at the work that

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,720
people have done in the past perhaps you

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,430
look at other people's comments on it

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,290
you maybe watch them listen to talks

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,850
like I'm going to give all this kind of

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,120
stuff but the thing you really look for

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,430
more than anything else is what other

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,900
people using it so if you're going to be

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,280
brave and use it you should be willing

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:55,260
to pay back at least by saying yeah we

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,750
use it i'm willing to say that get your

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,700
boss to say that another thing of course

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,260
is you can you can do promotion or give

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,740
talks on it you can promote it gives

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,470
talks on it lots of how many people have

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,370
linux users groups or or meet ups or

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,980
something like that in your area that

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,810
you go to so if there's a project you

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,970
use how do people think those people are

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,820
all always have all the speakers they

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,820
ever need for those things nobody so

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,940
show up if that's what's in front of you

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,770
to do show up and do it and the thing is

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,740
when you stand up here that's how people

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,060
mistake you for an expert it's because

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,400
you're standing behind this and it's

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,560
like oh he must be really really smart

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,209
he know he's just really dumb he doesn't

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,189
know not to do this

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:44,559
and and you can give talks and promote

00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:46,420
it in other ways you know you that might

00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,829
be whatever your site if your social

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,949
media person might be doing on social

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,660
media whatever right you can blog or

00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:55,119
write books on it as i mention here some

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,399
of the other people do have ever written

00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:59,110
books on these subjects and once you

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,119
become mistaken for an expert people

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,679
start asking you do things like write

00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:05,170
books on this stuff it really does

00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,939
happen I've had it as people want me to

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,649
write about my last project not about my

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:13,800
current one and I'm actually too busy as

00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:16,720
my current one at the moment anyway so

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,519
what sort of our question is what else

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,290
can you do you can do build packaging

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,959
continuous integration write tests or do

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:26,740
you testing you can fix bugs you can

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,929
write or attach your your pets to the

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,420
complaint that's the best you can write

00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,970
plugins a lot so the common thing to do

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,800
that's easy to do that there's usually a

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,869
lot of projects have a plug-in thing

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,610
that you do maybe it's a monitoring

00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,709
thing or maybe it's a discovery thing

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,420
like in my case whatever it is often the

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:47,139
plugin requires the least understanding

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,850
of the system and my experience was the

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,110
most contributions i got from average

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,079
system administrators tended to be

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,759
plugins so write a plug-in write code in

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,339
the main part dive in learn something

00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,170
deeper you know get in will you

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:04,059
understand it because it's usually

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:06,999
pretty cool stuff give encouragement say

00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,529
thanks and one of you have said thanks

00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,809
to the pizzas somebody on a mailing list

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:16,259
for their help or for the project for

00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:18,850
the software do it just do it because

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:20,350
otherwise it is literally a thankless

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,119
job and I don't know although that

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,610
sounds like a pond and I send is and

00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:27,730
it's sort of intentional the truth is it

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:31,029
is if people don't come back and say I

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,589
used it thank you what you will

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:39,699
otherwise get is I used it and I had a

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:41,350
problem now yeah it'd be nice be nice I

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,490
don't like when people are not nice on

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,360
my mailing list including me

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:49,299
occasionally I fail and I apologize and

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,690
if I don't send me a private email

00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:54,140
remind me that I haven't appalled

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,570
guys because that's my goal is to is to

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,420
create a nice place to work I want I

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,430
don't want to work in a sewer you know I

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,780
want to work in a nice place and if I'm

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,970
making it not a nice place you need to

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,030
tell me you just made a mess clean that

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:11,810
up like having a dog in the house that's

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:14,810
not trained you know purchase developer

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,400
support if your organization is capable

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,530
or able to purchase developer support

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,290
you know from the people who do the work

00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:24,560
not from somebody else he resells it

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,940
then do it because those the people are

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,400
actually doing the work not the people

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,530
who are used to meeting the software now

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,510
of course those people deserve support

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,920
for other reasons right but think about

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,330
providing support to the people who

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,330
actually provide the packages that you

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,610
really look rely upon and of course the

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,650
last step is after having explained what

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:46,700
to do why to do it what to do now the

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,920
next step is do it and to do it you

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,720
choose a project I suggest the

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,820
assimilation project it is by far the

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,410
coolest project on the planet and if you

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,410
don't believe me just ask me

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,930
but it's not important that you choose

00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,630
mine but do choose a project now

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,540
tomorrow this is the point where I give

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,070
my totally shameless plug I give a talk

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,870
on the assimilation project tomorrow and

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,800
as I has been witnessed here in this

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,750
room you've already heard it in this

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,490
very room it is the coolest project on

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,440
the planet you heard it right it's it's

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,960
a it's a system management tool that

00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,700
helps you understand what your systems

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,310
are doing and then does things about it

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,480
like for example if I know you have

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,760
running mysql this machine we just

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,900
monitor it for you if i say i look at

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,280
what you have here and I say you know

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,800
this is not in compliance with security

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,330
best practices we tell you because we

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,430
know more about your systems than you do

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,480
and we keep it up-to-date all the time

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,590
there's a lot of interesting things that

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,460
go with it we'll talk about that

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,480
tomorrow I don't want to talk about

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,520
anymore today but i but i got permission

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,450
to give my shameless plug here so i gave

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,130
it but the thing is show up do something

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,930
this is this is this would have been

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,040
lots better with the chooser project and

00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,780
then the last you know it would have all

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,250
gone through and very nicely pretty but

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,260
you know that you don't get to do that

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,200
with pdfs and if you can't get your

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,800
laptop to behave obviously i have to

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,170
figure that out before tomorrow because

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,550
because tomorrow slides are a little

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,070
different anyway i want to thank

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,040
everybody for your time and if you have

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,270
questions what the people have questions

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:28,130
about this we have 10 minutes for

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:32,270
questions sure so my question goes to

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,950
choosing a project to plug into i'm

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,690
thinking of a bun to in particular but

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,130
there is a bunch of projects where it

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,540
seems like there's a lot of noise around

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,480
hey we need to help hey we need to help

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:46,430
hey we need help you ask hey what do you

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,310
need help with well I don't know so what

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,490
threshold or what size of a project

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,170
would you aim at III don't think the

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,360
precise of the project is important I

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,980
think the important thing is so one of

00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,960
the things I discovered was one of the

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,940
things I happened in my project Linux h

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,650
a project I said nobody's contributing

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,120
anything and I thought oh maybe that's

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,660
because I didn't tell them what I need

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,620
doing so I made a to-do list right and I

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,809
think people have

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,670
to be able to answer that question you

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,990
know the thing let me tell you how I

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,820
answer that question with someone asked

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,960
me I give the process a what do you like

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,880
doing what are your skills you know

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,170
think about what you like doing if if

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,520
you're going to contribute to a project

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,710
in the air doing something you don't

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,360
like it's not going to work you either

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,280
want to learn it or you think it would

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,720
be fun to do it and maybe you try it for

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,670
a while discovered it wasn't so much fun

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,040
as you thought that's okay too you know

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,350
people apologize to me for not doing

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,240
what they committed to do I wish I could

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,510
tell you that was no abnormal but it's

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,760
not what's normal is that people my mom

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,200
used to say you're about eat when I was

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,970
a kid and eating your eyes are bigger

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,290
than your stomach a lot of people's eyes

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,830
are bigger than their stomach and that's

00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:00,830
the truth but you know show up find

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,150
something to do and do it it depends on

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,440
what you want to do is for example I

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,140
asked the guy what are your skills he

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,070
said I must have said min is that Oh

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,720
continuous integration is kind of a

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,280
sysadmin like skill you write scripts

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,050
you get stuff together you watch at work

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,120
I said why don't you look at that right

00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,320
so the thing is if they can't answer

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,510
that question you might want to find

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,100
another project and you might say look

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,980
if you could suggest something and here

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,260
are my skills then I would do it but if

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,840
you can't suggest something you know I

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,570
don't know what I can do right if the

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,660
project can't answer that question then

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,970
they don't know where they're going

00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,140
right I can answer that question you

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,050
tell me what your skills are and I will

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,770
find a place for you my probably take

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,570
other people's candy the same I wasn't

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,970
trying to say that my shameless plug is

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:52,730
actually over mostly but that's what you

00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,960
do you ask the core skills what you're

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,070
interested in doing the things that

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,510
sound like fun to you do you have

00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:01,040
anything that would be make use of those

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,270
skills and and sometimes show up and one

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,980
of the things I discovered in my career

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,380
is if you're willing to show up and do

00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,100
what no one else wants once wants to do

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,780
you'll have a job for life and that's

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,240
how come I dis system administration by

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,830
the way for ten years because nobody

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,570
else really wants to do that you know

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,720
it's like and I was willing to do it and

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,980
I like doing it and so anyway next

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,470
question I think you're telling the

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,900
wrong

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,870
group that Ellen no but it's really true

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,880
it's really true that that that you know

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,650
a lot of what you do nobody else wants

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,559
to do and that's one of the reasons why

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:37,530
they're actually in demand somebody who

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:45,570
will show up and do the work right next

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:47,490
question you start back in the back do

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,440
you have a suggested time frame were you

00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,750
know what you should do a project where

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,610
you know for the length of you know for

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,159
the individual that were beginning

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,720
versus you know you know gangstar I'll

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,190
be like a three month or six months or

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,580
so much so I would start with something

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:06,150
really small I mean I was starting

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,740
something you can do in a day because do

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:12,750
you have like a real job a day job I

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,950
mean most people here do and I have what

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,450
you have a life and you have kids you

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,500
have grandkids whatever I have grandkids

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,140
different people in different situations

00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,409
and the truth is this will never be as

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,820
important as life this only reason

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:27,570
Porton is your wife or your husband or

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,610
your kids or whatever right and and you

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,960
can't although I said it can help your

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,340
career it won't help your career if you

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,220
do this at the exclusion of your real

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,320
job so think about what's going to fit

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,030
into your life the way it is right that

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,650
you can squeeze out the time to do that

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,409
you can get permission for your wife or

00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,750
whatever your situation is to do this

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:47,490
and squeeze it out because if you can't

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,840
you're going to be the person whose eyes

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,309
are bigger than your stomach and not be

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,870
able to do it I start with something

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:59,970
small and and you know like file a good

00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:02,220
bug report right Oh correct spelling in

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,929
a documentation correct punctuation in a

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,429
documentation whatever it i don'ti not

00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:09,750
you know whatever it is that occurs to

00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:12,030
you show up and do something people

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,380
notice that too now actually come in and

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,030
say you're obviously an idiot because

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,320
you can't spell that's not going to get

00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,210
you anywhere so i'm going to say i just

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,880
noticed this and thought you might want

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,440
to have it corrected and if you correct

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,490
it from british spelling to american

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,000
spelling it's probably not going to go

00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,000
over well either

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,250
so but you get the idea right find

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,070
something small to do to start with

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,740
because then you'll get known as the guy

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,990
who shows up and does stuff right as

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,040
opposed to I'll help you a lot I'll give

00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,660
you a lot of training and stuff and then

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,190
you won't do it because you don't have

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,950
the time you've bitten off more than you

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,600
can chew if you show up and do stuff

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,410
then people say oh I know you I'll help

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,929
you it's like any it's this it's like it

00:23:51,410 --> 00:24:17,660
has a remarkable resemblance to life

00:23:53,929 --> 00:24:18,770
itself yes yes sir absolutely there are

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,820
certain vendors have done a fantastic

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:26,030
job chef for one I work for dr. doctors

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,340
cut a fantastic job we go in and you see

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,870
they tell you exactly how to commit and

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,760
to give you fools of things that they're

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,830
looking they're fixed I would recommend

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,250
anybody managing an open source project

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:39,230
to be very diligent about opening out

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,330
setting most people

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:49,650
they're just too afraid to go in and do

00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:51,360
anything and that's true and one of the

00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,940
things the point something I'll mention

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,260
here that goes with what you exactly

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,840
what you said here is that every project

00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,050
is different and if you try and apply

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,640
one project expectation to another one

00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,110
it may or may not work for you and you

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,850
may get corrected politely and you may

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,530
get not corrected probably I'd like I

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:11,510
prefer projects that collect correct you

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,950
politely but that may not happen to you

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:22,110
open source projects are not all well

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:24,870
known for their social skills and those

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:28,710
that are often become hackers that we

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:35,670
call that social engineering right not

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:37,350
another question so now just now the

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,400
thing is before you leave here to think

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,230
about what project you're going to

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,570
contribute to and if you don't have one

00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,910
in mind show up at mine and he will

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:54,360
harangue me until I get you on something

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:58,860
good to do on my project yeah so I have

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,810
a few oh right one of the things that

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,210
hurts us at the moment was I just

00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,770
switched source control systems and so

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,630
all the documentation i have to get

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:12,870
started is wrong but i mean it happened

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:20,790
like two weeks ago so it's so there's a

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:23,400
documentation opportunity so any other

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,600
questions all right with that I'll let

00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,750
you guys go and thanks very much for

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,750
your time

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:36,040
we're going to have the happy hour in

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,280
about five minutes in a 160 with the vin

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,020
de vendor expo we have a birds of

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,680
feather sessions coming on tonight

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,320
between six and eight don't quote me on

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,320
that there's stuff on the wall on the

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,090
opposite side of that wall and Alan's

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,300
going to be at the keynote dinner

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:58,090
tonight if anyone else wants to continue

00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:01,960
the conversation or maybe contribute

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:03,850
back a something do so at the keynote

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,670
dinner we're selling tickets at

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,990
registration and I have stickers for

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,640
those of you like stickers the stickers

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,840
look roughly like the back of my shirt

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,160
so it says resistance is futile and has

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,160
