not one mainly the there's kind of

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,620
warranty statuses though highlight there

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,809
anything at Turner family means all good

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,550
right success anything at thriller

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,650
family means go somewhere else we're

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,630
sending you to a URL of the direction of

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,010
sight a 400 family means Phi Phi dare

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,890
you ask for something that you couldn't

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,750
have for something that wasn't there 500

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,430
means the server could filter your

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,289
request right this is good to know

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,580
because if you're between a 400 or 500

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,460
error is how to start troubleshooting a

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,570
problem right let's server so all the

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,079
other ones that I think the character

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,680
just there will say so first one I

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,059
mention the 110 one so the protocols

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,070
telling the client or tone the client

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,520
back pain we upgrade your we switch to

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,980
one that one instead of 10 right usually

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,430
this will become this would be added

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,320
with a upgrade header I believe saying

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,539
hey we've moved over to one that won a

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,030
better protocol right we'll probably see

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,100
does come out a little more maybe with

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:08,970
switching from one that one to two

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:12,330
switching protocols you later it's all

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,090
good right oh so 200 ok it's kind of

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,310
most common web to expect to see 204 no

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,439
content essentially everything was good

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,100
but nothing really to generator come

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,369
back is right shifting it off and I'm a

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,460
good example of that doing ok is easy to

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:35,220
a for good leaving bleeding yeah never

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,400
good with thank you all right yeah thank

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,890
you my head is all right forgot the

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,500
redirection right so I'll feel me right

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,939
move from relief foundress the other

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,930
essentially you've made a request but

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,869
I'm telling you to go somewhere else

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,509
right baby domain.com go to WWE com for

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,490
this example redirection or maybe you

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,350
are update your site to have new links

00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,720
so all your old things give 30 thread

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:12,760
reader

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:14,830
to other sites right all right Oh 400

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,990
client-side ever this means you messed

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,150
up on the request right I booking fire

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,340
air earth they messed up so some you

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,080
guys someone's here are 400 bad request

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,380
right how are you formed your

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,970
quest a server not so good right my

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,300
favorite one is throw it to payment

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,030
required I've never seen home I did it

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,440
Oh successfully not officially uh in a

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,880
very true fashion by wasi you right oh

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,130
just take get half a scene where you get

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,240
paid hey up especially working in a man

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,670
toasting field I'd love to have it up

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,050
there for the forbidden break common

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,850
right you've asked something you cannot

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,780
have either because of your IP address

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,370
or the user or it done for that okay

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,140
anything to get a fourth for vapor bit

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,870
404 not found is probably the most

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,730
common ones or a long most well-known

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,350
that means you after something that you

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,519
could not have or so that's not there

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:11,890
right if you asked for index 1.html SF

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,540
index.html and then 420 is not a very

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,670
widely implemented response code but

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,090
it's from twitter twitter twitter

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:29,140
response code you get for 20 if it's

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:30,910
come down here you go Tim for 20 it's

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,060
told you need it back off from the API

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,890
hope it so that research kind of look at

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,400
cab just interesting to talk about that

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,080
came up what those kinda nice basically

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,709
Twitter rate limiting you when you make

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,709
a very quests

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:54,980
hardy har har Twitter again that link is

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:57,160
there in the slide if you need it Oh 500

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:00,080
error codes or service I error codes

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,210
this means that request that you sent

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,980
was good but someone will align the

00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,620
server messed up or could not handle the

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,560
request most often we see this when it

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,120
comes to between proxy and connection

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,010
between maybe a friend server in the

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,610
back innocent replication server right

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,590
the at least for our environment the

00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,950
culprit most of the time for example

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,120
with a 503 service unavailable was going

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,440
to be at a tomcat patient in the

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
background running that just kind of

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,120
hung up write a file too bad gateway

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,920
user you might see that it may be your

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,470
proxy inventions from maybe in the next

00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,030
to teach be in the background right and

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,070
that it just wasn't said quickly you

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,960
might give that gateway there and then

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,790
500 internal server error was probably

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,790
an area code somewhere again but all of

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,190
these but the wrong with you it's me not

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:52,280
cheap right or the service saying it's

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:53,960
me not you again if I hide these often

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,120
write four hundred verses five hundred

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,790
because that began to tell us where the

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,650
game troubleshooting right if I get a

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,940
400 airbag I need to tell a customer

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,010
look at the cove looking either making

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,870
that request alright so you either look

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,390
for something that's not there or asking

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,280
for you in a bad way if it's a 500 error

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,290
I can say hey let some of the server

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,930
look whatever approximate just off to

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,520
let's look to see maybe board a cactus

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,400
may be missing upon suicide or mage

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:24,290
season restart but good Java it doesn't

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:29,300
that it was a long cool let's eat here

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:32,810
alright cool so fill out tools now um to

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,280
marry tools right curl and HTTP pie I'll

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,630
do a quick demo of them here a little

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,000
bit much one get through the slide at

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,340
least look we're go on so these command

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
line tool so your tools you can use from

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,870
your from a terminal to kind of make

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,960
requests back right to download files to

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,440
interact with web servers HTTP is meant

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,190
to be replacement for curl in typical

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,000
requests and a bit more of a

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,950
streamlined fashion will say right

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,620
there's a lot you can do with crow with

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,450
lot flags and add headers hd5 just makes

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,330
a little bit easier right then we're all

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,580
about making these little easier and

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,919
then on the plugin side or the browser

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,090
side I want to start to analyze right

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,070
that's like it really insane what's

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,050
going on with every single request they

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,310
make a web page which you realize what

00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,210
what you'll want to because there's so

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,290
many you have two da fees you can have

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,660
Firebug which is what my favorites not

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,970
only can you look at your request so

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,250
much more and then live HTTP headers

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,380
towards and capture those requests right

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,419
if to be headers has the option to

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,330
captures requests and then play back

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,710
it's kinda nice right again all tools

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,290
that we use every day when

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
troubleshooting any of the number of

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:47,300
problems we have in surface every single

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:52,790
day all right here so this is the famous

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:55,580
knees toes are pointing its back hey

00:06:52,790 --> 00:07:01,460
about eight minutes Sarang time and

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:06,280
actually all right so real quick Oh Bosh

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,280
wheel here let's do this let's bring up

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:17,410
that's very dangerous thing to do right

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:19,430
now variance freeze Oh with my server

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:29,050
side vision crawl right so we can you

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:31,400
curl Oh pearl right HTTP that work right

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,710
awesome price Gideon response back right

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,900
it's simple it's a basic one might be

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,820
also do so this right here is kind of

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,860
streamline we saw her example right that

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,100
telnet command was earlier and actually

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,930
doing get / right that streamlining for

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,419
this is streamlining that request right

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,130
I can also go through and say just give

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:53,780
me the header information right say oh

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,610
cool she and back information should get

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,370
just came back a response to information

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,550
right here we see we saw HTTP one dot

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,180
one alright we get toward okay back in

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
the server

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,610
can we get a definition of different

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:11,030
region about the server hi nice if I

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:16,780
want to do something like to hear I can

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,780
also say a dash a troid and maybe a host

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,380
now this kind of redundant I'm giving

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,419
example how you can add additional

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,449
headers to that request if you want it

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:29,979
to write to kind of compare this we can

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:35,450
also do a toilet earlier show you HTTP

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:39,200
so not confused httpd HTTP is a HTTP pi

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,669
application i'll show you earlier what's

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,459
kind eyes doing the information back in

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,260
various formats of most five most

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,810
popular even something come back to json

00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,050
it's kind of nice using parts that data

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,089
right but then you see here how hi Rita

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,470
oops I'll read out your egg method you

00:08:53,089 --> 00:09:01,510
are our butts right up a very basic HTTP

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:04,190
will say google.com when we get back is

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,820
an example of a 301 say hey move

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,779
permanently and let's see here some of

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,380
the other ones are you right we have

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:20,110
that show you non-standard headers right

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:23,420
but saying move permanently go to www

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,990
necklace i doing right again nothing

00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,930
crazy here we give back our information

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,610
right

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:35,410
this is more involved big ton of time

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,960
all right so switching back to the

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,330
browser itself you know what let's just

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,910
use this I have uptown so there is a

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,310
plugin called Firebug which is what my

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,140
favorite tools when texting on the floor

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,580
and they start day one go down this

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,710
installed master to install from right

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,270
away because it was you want to install

00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,580
it you want this all before you need it

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,920
right senator restart everything have

00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,550
that whole process so when you arrest

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,490
request real quick we're like is that

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:07,620
basic a tall drink West's a little

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:10,150
bigger and then I can go through and

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,530
exam that request right and here we see

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,360
a lot of things I've talked about in the

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,710
slides right so again keep me giving it

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,900
a frame of reference of how all that

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,240
information ties in to actual

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,580
application here right I have the

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,770
headers from my response items by

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,700
request headers I can't actual response

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,760
content right oh then get candy fish in

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,650
there right so this is a nice way to

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,870
user to analyze right it's also nice is

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,540
that on the right hand side here we have

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:41,650
a timeline of how long did request to

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,360
have simply useful when you have an

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,370
image that there you be in four or five

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,250
minutes that's right why's my side slow

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,230
we're gonna go your logo is here by 100

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,440
what is five minutes that's going to be

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,910
for that it's a power you know problems

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,130
make themself really really apparent

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,070
when you have so then this I here just

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,480
taking forever right also had I've also

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,790
used this to focus your problem where

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,550
again customers saying slide slow it

00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,200
loads about halfway and stops we use

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,820
this totem we found was that by halfway

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,490
fairly was making a call to another site

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,750
with a service for ads that she wasn't

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,150
responding to any problems with their

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,220
own and so if humming was entire sign up

00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,500
it wasn't going to render until it got

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,450
that code back right so who's with

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,880
Sheila customer hey here's where Tony

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,370
Allen's not us right all these domains

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,170
here are you you're good this domains

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,779
are going for is it once or

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,910
now so yeah we're troubleshooting get

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,370
information that metric customer and say

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,990
here's your problem right I didn't say

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:44,769
my side slope and the last one I have it

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:47,320
don't happen so let's find out live HTTP

00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,690
headers okay this year I can choose to

00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,209
capture it not capture right let's make

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,839
a request let me see on the request all

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:58,720
the hitter has come through here it I

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,889
can save them for later analysis I put

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:12,930
replayed that I want to things like that

00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:12,930
so off on stuff all right okay bless you

00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:20,410
all right so in closing right Regina

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,149
quite again switch back to the first

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,750
slide is i'm lazy not putting in a

00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,750
summary slide

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,490
and I'd go back to the agenda right how

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,930
has the last thing has a main

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,300
presentation right how much you're going

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,630
to tell them tell them hold it hold

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:42,170
right I know that where's my start was

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:46,070
saying stuff really bad better twice

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,680
anyway so oh so first off to why this

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,209
topic right again it's about back to

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,430
basics about how to understanding of the

00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,920
underlying protocol that handles almost

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,390
all the requests for web server right so

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,580
that was a very good sign you updated

00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,690
absolutely key to central some talk

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,490
about why they should be a very high

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,220
level right we talked about is a

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,440
protocol for your tooth Queen out right

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,330
but mainly a lot about version 11 dot

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,950
one talk about methods right get

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,290
requests or as it gets options head

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,180
right those requests or safe get

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,399
efficient from the server put in post

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,589
it's an English into the server right

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,540
 if I headers again how does it work

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:24,649
just a way that the client and the

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,760
server can share a bit more information

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,990
about what they want or what they prefer

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,670
response codes are important right

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,370
because it tells us it's a sort of

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,100
telling us what's okay do is there an

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,589
error with your for my fault right and

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,589
double fe tools that we troubleshoot and

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:47,810
get deeper into a problems you might be

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:50,110
having okay and so with all that seat

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,110
here

00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,170
in closing if you're interested have

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,540

00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:40,879
good friend of my ideas for me there we

go so I promise I put it up there show

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,809
everybody and at least give her a shot

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:51,079
for that so she's awesome she works for

00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:56,239
blue box and gave a short sale somewhere

00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:58,399
rather oh anyway so oh nevermind though

00:14:56,239 --> 00:15:00,769
usually have a booth somewhere where we

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:06,410
go I don't think you have today so we

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:09,339
are but whatever oh so to a day any

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,889
questions thoughts concerns anything or

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:16,999
not whiskey I know it's early and we

00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:19,399
talk about whiskey it's our users going

00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,019
to get anything with two point oh um

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,910
they should they should see a

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,959
performance increase right because it

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,129
should be the big thinking speeding is

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,660
trying to organize that data so it gets

00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,939
back to the client in a fashion fashion

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,829
right Google's have around for a while

00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:36,470
in chrome after actually um the speedy a

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,819
while back but from the client site we

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,230
should see you in this life improving on

00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:41,230
game content back row faster

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:49,760
rest api they're all using yeah so some

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:54,440
question about resonates if you guys are

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,060
maybe in particular or just um i don't

00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,660
want to say about me guess I'll do to

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:02,360
put yeah so yes yes I think his method

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,820
is to commission a server and say hey I

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,580
want me to request usually for example

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,320
museum making a request to hey create

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,360
new server for us MacLeod to create this

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,910
or that for store this file for us great

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,280
I want the part that request in as part

00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,680
of the head was there yeah but I guess

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:31,130
I'm up top man I can't talk too much I

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:33,620
guess yep sure yeah slide your own if

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:37,430
amazing was supposed to be on hidden

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,750
time in God actually interpretation is

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,480
that that was doing reason I know about

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:45,260
20 for okay yeah that's up every day I'm

like oh yeah yeah and I actually do

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,140
presentation the wall back internally on

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,000
cleat guys I can do request with that I

00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,670
