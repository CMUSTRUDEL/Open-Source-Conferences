awesome cast network we had them on last

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,309
year before ohio linux fest which is the

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,680
subject of today it's coming up here I

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,479
in October the weekend of the second if

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
I'm not mistaken the second through the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,369
third out there in Columbus we have with

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,060
us first of all Susan rose on your right

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:25,320
if you're on the video and vans coach

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,820
endure cokin door opener oh good oh so

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,590
close i was so close thank you for

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,229
joining me again oh it's great to be

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:36,630
here and you got the the VIP that you

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,490
get your own show this time so so I mean

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,560
it gets weird i talking about iphones

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,869
next to the next to linux so much right

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,950
but not but it makes sense right oh we

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,689
talked about before it's kind of

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,390
everywhere you're right yeah a lot of

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,729
stuff is all tied together mmm so for

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,880
the uninitiated tell me what is ohio

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,090
linux fest so I linux fest well it

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,570
started back in was 2002 I believe was

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,600
the first year the it was originally a

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,270
group of linux user groups or several

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,770
linux user groups in Ohio said well hey

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,050
why don't we get together and have a

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,860
conference so they all sort of converged

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,890
on Columbus at the Ohio State campus

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,530
and they they pulled that off and then

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,500
the following year they had some sort of

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,180
a conflict over at over at the campus

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,870
they weren't able to use the buildings

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,730
so it it kind of grew into an actual

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,300
full-fledged conference they got you

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,240
know hotel conference rooms and then

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,410
since then we've been moved over to the

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,810
Greater Columbus Convention Center and

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,990
it's been there ever since it's amazing

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,000
awesome and that's cool because I mean I

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,250
know here Pittsburgh we go I'm very used

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,709
to the we are loose nature we have with

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,240
our pod campus but this is a full one

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,270
conference right like how many how many

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,310
people are typically a part of this uh

00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,950
we get our our attendance last year I

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,170
think was somewhere in the high 800s no

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,850
it's generally fluctuated somewhere

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,260
around there a hundred to a thousand

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:10,650
people is is kind of what we planned for

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,209
excellent excellent so tell me for those

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,130
who don't know again for some of the

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,420
uninitiated you know we talk about linux

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,269
a lot last year when we had you on the

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,600
show and kind of the state of it and and

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,799
and especially these days it seems at

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,989
least if you're paying attention to the

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,340
tech side of things linux seems to be a

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:27,930
part of a little bit more everything of

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,360
course our android phones are Android

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,400
TVs fire tvs are all kind of based

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,489
around this stuff what are some

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,769
surprising things that it that is run on

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,120
this on the soccer on this operating

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,360
system but maybe some people don't know

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,040
out there well you mentioned TVs that's

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,480
one thing i mean a lot of times you'll

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,670
get a couple years ago i bought a TV for

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,290
my mom and it comes in the manual

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,320
there's a little page in there that says

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,489
you know this contains linux software in

00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,110
there and here's where you can go to

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,340
actually download the software for the

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:05,340
TV I haven't I haven't taken a step to

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,870
reflash that so the always so they

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,209
actually like it reveals except I

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,030
thought maybe like the Linux consumer

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,209
side it'll be a little bit hidden right

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,400
it often can be they should you know

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,049
according to the the license that the

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,930
Linux kernel is under they should give

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,970
you at least notice that says you know

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,940
this software is contained within here

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,780
and here's where you can go to get it if

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,170
they just

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:35,639
the binary version on on the device with

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,490
you now different hardware manufacturers

00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,590
you know the embedded space they tend to

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,240
be focused on ok well let's cram the

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,010
software in there and make sure it works

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,340
and get it done and so they don't always

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,470
observe those niceties on the on the the

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,630
licensing side but yeah you can find it

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,750
in all kinds of embedded devices is

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:58,470
driven my daughter at one point worked

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,169
for a company that had a library their

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:07,890
company was allowing people to look in

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:10,260
their library of Linux programs that

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,260
were already created for the Internet of

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,150
Things type uses so for example washing

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,229
machines and coffee pots and all

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,690
different kinds of things and they

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:24,450
therefore by paying a subscription they

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,060
could not have to start start from

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,190
square one when they were making the

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,180
program and for a similar object they

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,680
could they could see how far along

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,500
somebody else did with the particular

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,860
Internet of Things type thing and then

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,090
they could go from there to build on

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,370
that so so you don't know we're at what

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,770
you're touching that that could contain

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,169
Linux in it certainly it seems like it's

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,910
kind of a exploded here over the last

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,020
several years excited you mentioned the

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,680
Internet of Things of course we're

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,720
talking about like like the fridges and

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,280
our cars and everything I think there's

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,990
a base of Linux in my I don't know how

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,669
Microsoft Sync and I think they used a

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,800
little bit of that in there too I think

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,940
with it was just talking with Mike there

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,320
was an article go around this week that

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,740
a Microsoft is actually using Linux for

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,740
their Apache servers in some aspect so

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,110
it's really interesting to see them all

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,350
kind of getting getting attached that so

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,260
what are the benefits and obviously why

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,810
has linux kind of exploded into Internet

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:31,080
of Things all these devices not just

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,600
computers and tablets I mean there are a

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,669
few different things as Susan pointed

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,050
out you don't have to start from square

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:41,670
one you have a base and a lot of times

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,530
it just requires

00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,410
if you have a new piece of hardware or

00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:50,610
something it just requires making some

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,050
alterations to it in order to to get an

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,230
operating system running on the new

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,670
board so essentially it just it removes

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,140
the amount of work that you have to do

00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:03,270
yourself the the free licensing is also

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,540
a benefit because I mean you could also

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,630
try to do that with some of the

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,060
proprietary embedded systems but you

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,340
know then you end up having to pay a

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,270
per-unit cost for each one that you ship

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,900
and on on the other hand if you're using

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:25,410
Linux you you do have to provide the

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,250
code and you have to you know do the

00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:30,990
maintenance on it but those are more or

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,120
less the fixed costs instead if it

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,130
doesn't go up each for each one that you

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,140
sell your not paying that incremental

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,870
cost it's really just a one-time cost

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,710
that you can spread out among all all

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,350
the units that you sell most so going

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,690
back to your ohio linux fest is coming

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,560
up here october second and third here in

00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,060
columbus I so I'm looking at this and

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,530
first thing I'm not really digging into

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,300
the site too much or maybe a first

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,230
impression is well I'm not a developer

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,740
wait what why why is this for developers

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,470
is this for more in computer enthusiasts

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,770
at what levels are people coming here

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:13,650
obviously a lot of people are you know

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,000
800 last year and so so what what kind

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,900
of people you're attracting who would

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,800
benefit from from from this event or

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,570
pitching it at a pretty as broad of an

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,530
audience as we can get I mean certainly

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:31,290
developers for sure we've got talks

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,090
organized into sort of tracks where we

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,250
could fit them together we've got

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,640
several that are oriented towards sword

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,110
towards the community we've got several

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,730
that are oriented towards security

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,150
people working on virtualization that's

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,920
sort of a big a big deal nowadays and

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,520
the contain a whole container space is

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,380
one where people are you know you get

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,610
all sorts of different options

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:04,350
on there so i would say it it tends to

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,570
skew towards people who are often

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,360
professionally involved so either the

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,550
developers or system administrators but

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,000
i mean we do have a fair number of

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:21,390
people who just you know like myself i I

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,680
have no IT professional experience this

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,720
is really just sort of a personal

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,520
interest for me so you know it's

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
something that you're that you're you

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,790
have a personal interest in just as a

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,220
user I think would be helpful for for

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,140
those people as well so yeah and you

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,070
have to remember too that this is a

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,700
linux / free open-source software

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:47,670
convention as well so on it for people

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,470
cringe we're still using windows there

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,470
are quite a number of free and open

00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,540
source software on programs i just made

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:01,680
a brief list like firefox thunderbird

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:05,700
 openoffice libreoffice and i've

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:12,540
also used drupal in chat Zilla for the

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:15,090
IRC client so so that whole freedom the

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,460
whole freedom thing of being able to use

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,120
something that's free this downloadable

00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:26,820
that's that works well you know on your

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,560
computer is is is liberating and people

00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,910
always move to the direction of more

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,440
freedom and the whole idea of free and

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,350
open source software and operating

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,020
systems gives you more choice more

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:44,820
freedom more creativity possibly less

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,100
cost but finding the culture of that

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,700
environment with all the people that

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,740
believe in those type of ideals and then

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,370
like way cool and they're helping one

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,190
another they have not at ohio linux best

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,160
per se but the the lugs certainly have

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,530
installed fests and and help each other

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,670
out with different hardware issues and

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,300
reinstall issues and and and you know

00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,240
share

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,970
tips on a on a new open source program

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,380
maybe you don't really know what the

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:21,630
best use of blender is or what how to do

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,080
something on that they they'll show

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:28,310
each other things and and that

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,890
collaboration is such a teamwork and

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,320
that's probably the greatest love of a

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,180
lot of people that they come there for

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,230
the technology but then they get hooked

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,680
into the arm to the whole culture of of

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,260
the free and open source movement and oh

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,010
by the way it's not just for software

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,560
and Linux it's also free hardware we're

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,140
talking about protecting rights for

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,540
people so that they can change the

00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,170
operating system in their tablet or

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,290
their you know their devices and so that

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,970
they aren't locked down or locked out of

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,010
of using the hardware that they purchase

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,769
in the way that they would like to do

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,660
yeah I know Microsoft making some

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,490
interesting strides and it seems to be

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,860
walking in computers that I will only

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,260
have windows on them in interesting ways

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:23,579
i noticed slow upgrading some try not

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:26,579
windows 10 it registered it to the to

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,050
the board entirely it makes me wonder if

00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,240
I can't even put ubuntu on this thing

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,140
and I know there's been some talk one

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,230
way or another with some chip

00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,899
configurations so so what um well in

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,880
that I think so Whitney you know when we

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,130
look at some people are saying well i

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
got my upgrade for free for Windows 10

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:48,149
but that's not really free in the long

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,550
run is it well I mean you you get and I

00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:53,370
have to say I'm not very familiar with

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,339
the windows pricing how that's supposed

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,709
to be working now I don't think anybody

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,770
who generally uses windows and it was

00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,959
either like I got a free like I'm still

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,720
waiting for the other foot to drop like

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,490
and then when do i upgrade oh you know

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,019
what were you doing next is this gonna

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:12,000
be subscription thing yeah I think we're

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,829
all with different models I mean I guess

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,089
you know the you know the Apple model is

00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,589
they you know they charge you when you

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,990
buy the hardware they charge you for it

00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,060
and it it comes it comes with that I

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,030
haven't quite figured out what the with

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,190
the new microsoft model is going to be

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,340
but as Susan was pointing out i mean

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,440
it's it's free it's a sort of a dual

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,690
thing it's it's not so much the fries in

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,790
price although that is part of it but

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,820
it's also the fact that it's free isn't

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:42,020
freedom so the the software code is

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,570
available at and it was open for anyone

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,150
to make an improvement if you find a bug

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,370
or something like that I'm not a

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,740
programmer so I can't fix it but I could

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,050
at least you know bring it to somebody

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,600
else and say hey I've got this this

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,900
program it does everything and I need

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,120
but there's one thing missing and so I

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,870
can take it to them and say okay can you

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,390
add in this feature and the typically

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,270
the the way most of these projects are

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,960
our setup is it's a community

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,940
development so that you know you you

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,030
could have a company that just releases

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,340
stuff and just kind of lets it go and

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:25,040
and never never interacts with anybody

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,480
but the common model is to say okay well

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,780
we're going to have this public

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,640
repository we're going to have a public

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,620
place where it will take bug reports and

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,450
we'll respond to them and will you know

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,390
listen to what your suggestions are four

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,850
features and maybe we'll implement some

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,550
of them but you know maybe some of them

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,780
are so popular but there you always have

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,160
the option you always of the freedom

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:51,140
because it's free software that you can

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,330
go and if if the actual main developers

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,070
won't do something for you you can

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,880
always go elsewhere one thing I've

00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,990
noticed um because I you know I don't

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,700
know if we talked about this last year

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,160
but I always had the friend that was

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,840
running you know we're talking 1999-2000

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,430
and he had late debian linux and

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,410
everything and he's going in and coming

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,630
in line and writing bash files and

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,760
everything and that really colored and i

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,950
think a lot of people at that time how

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,270
computers i guess five years earlier i

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,710
was doing dos commands in the same

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,710
fashion and probably impressing the hell

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,800
out of my grandma right but you know

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:27,290
that really colored my perception of

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,670
linux oh I'd love to use it but I don't

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,990
want to have to go in to make it work

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,060
with my computer was always my

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,280
perception yeah I I build computers I

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,440
mean I'm not unfamiliar with it with the

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,270
hardware with a sock or etc

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,890
and I've noticed over the years you know

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,030
a bun to is one that I've messed with a

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,930
lot mint a puppy linux is another fun

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:50,450
one and I the softening of Linux can i

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,850
call it you know I when I put in a bun

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,270
to on a laptop I actually still have a

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,040
two thousand five ish dell XPS that runs

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,750
like a dream when I throw a bun to on it

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,610
and and and it's usable it's comparable

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:10,280
visually with current operating systems

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,540
has is that kind of we've worked out all

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,580
the bugs and you don't have to worry

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,610
about things not working it is is that a

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:20,210
big key to the adoption of this as a

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,190
desktop situation yeah I mean I guess

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,060
you know you always have the the

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,220
perpetual you know whenever anybody

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,440
doesn't have an article to write they'll

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,700
go churn out one that you know say oh is

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,370
this the year of the Linux desktop and I

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,140
would agree that that yeah it's the

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,240
installation is a lot easier i'm susan

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,640
and mentioned the install fests actually

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,060
at the here in Pittsburgh of the western

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,910
Pennsylvania linux user group we we kind

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:53,200
of stopped having install fest so about

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:56,300
a year or two ago we used to do them

00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,960
several times a year and we kind of gave

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,420
up because nobody was really coming

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,280
because they really didn't it was they

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,740
could take care of it on their own he

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,890
didn't really need then it was something

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,420
where you know maybe if you had an odd

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,699
piece of hardware or something like that

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,400
that might take some tweaking but you

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:21,050
know most you no ordinary commodity

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,770
stuff I pretty much just works if it's

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,420
something really new you know some some

00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,760
some you know fancy new piece of

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,100
hardware you know support can lag behind

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,200
but you know usually once it's out for a

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,660
while you know the people get excited

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,060
about it and say oh I want to use you

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,370
know linux on this and so somebody steps

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:43,460
up and actually writes a driver for it

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,120
for me that's a linux ubuntu lynx is my

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,310
test when you see the computers lying

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,210
around here and when i worked into the

00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,620
system if I

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,080
can't take a thumb drive put ubuntu

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,679
linux and it doesn't even load or

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,720
install that laptop or whatever is not i

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,029
can't get any use out of it anymore you

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,919
know at least i can put linux on it at

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:05,600
least I can put linux on it and use it

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,799
for a bit like that laptop I mentioned

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
the one I was putting on last night was

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,570
actually one that my wife is my my

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
school at pop from 2011 maybe and that's

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,120
why and that's why it's so good as a

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,940
secondary market oh yeah have computers

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,510
being reused that are really decent

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:27,260
computers i'm actually getting one from

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:32,659
from my daughter from free geek chicago

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:34,429
that's a reconditioned laptop that has i

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:37,309
don't know what distro it will have on

00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:41,480
it but i'm very excited about it because

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:44,270
it'll be bug free it'll be running fast

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,090
it'll you know it's a great machine and

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,399
people just you know throw them out like

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,090
pantyhose with a run on it is ditch the

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:56,450
computer and get a new one you know so

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:59,210
this is a great way to leave your

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,520
whatever junk footprint to be I want to

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,669
know about no carbon footprint but your

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,620
junk fit to be a lot smaller and help a

00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:08,929
lot of people to there's a lot of people

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:12,529
that can't afford computers that that

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:17,690
benefit with like computer reach it's a

00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:21,200
big nonprofit here that takes use

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,409
computers and and dr. some up and then

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,510
puts all the linux operating systems on

00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,070
them and then sends them to people in

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,340
need whether they're local or whether

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,399
they're across the world in Africa yeah

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,929
and I'll actually be doing what I talk

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,179
it at a high line express they're going

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,159
to be doing one of the presentations on

00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,630
saturday so awesome speaking of

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,029
presentations tell me where that where

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,059
are the highlights what should what

00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:48,799
should I be checking out if I'm coming

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:51,049
ok Lallana why don't I sort of run

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,580

friday october second saturday october

00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:03,740
third mm-hmm the saturday is sort of

00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:06,500
traditionally been are our main events

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,620
but i mean friday now has kind of

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,870
expanded to the point where it's it's

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,450
really kind of worth going as well i

00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:17,480
mean not that it was ever not worth but

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,750
we had a lot less content running at the

00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,740
time mm-hmm and now now it really is

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,480
pretty stuff both days so on friday

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,440
we've got way we call our early penguins

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,179
track which are just sort of Nora normal

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,170
tracks the same way that we would have

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:37,340
at on Saturday so we have subjects like

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,750
something you might be interested in

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,000
podcast broadcasting and production and

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,050
it's it's kind of random topics we have

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,730
some programming stuff a web content

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:55,340
management system that we've got it was

00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:00,340
the other one oh yeah systemd that's the

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:03,650
the new boot system or the the

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,559
underlying init system that is is some

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:11,270
of the very early software that runs and

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:14,540
it it's caused a lot of controversy I

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,740
guess among some of the people but it's

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,170
starting to appear in a lot of the

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,179
distributions and it's it works

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,130
differently so i have a feeling that's

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:26,179
going to be popular too for people to

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:29,990
learn how to do it and none on saturday

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,510
we're going to have four different main

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,270
tracks going at the same time so you

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,070
know we'll have one track where one is

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,520
going to be about web development and

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,400
and other development topics we've got

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,480
one on virtualization and containers

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,050
we've got one that's going to be on

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,030
networking and security and then we've

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,650
got one that's going to be mostly about

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,280
sort of community subjects like the

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,600
computer reach I was telling you about

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,020
so I don't know just to pick out a few

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,300
things uh I was looking through some of

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,650
the slides that people had sent in the

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:10,460
there's one about defense in depth sort

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:13,309
of how to set up your security processes

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,620
on on kind of a high level say okay well

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,510
how do we you know instead of just

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,540
setting up a firewall and

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,790
and then you know forgetting it you know

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,160
how do you set up a layer of layers of

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,940
Defense's if you have you know if you

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,920
want to protect your system from

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:36,890
malicious people or malware trying to

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:39,580
break in so those are those are four

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,960
tracks of people that have submitted

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,470
applications that have the topics

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,420
reviewed and accepted and assembled in

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,030
these four tracks but I wanted to

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:53,030
mention there's actually six tracks

00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:55,580
there's two more on Saturday where else

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:59,000
in the world are you going to go for

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:02,660
free if you enroll in the enthusiasts

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,180
pass ah for pre-registration it's going

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,340
to give you six tracks of options now

00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,190
the other two tracks are a career track

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,250
that show you all day long how that

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,100
whatever advance your career and then

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,620
the other one is the is the open source

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,400
solution stage that some of our sponsors

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:25,820
are telling us about their products so

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,390
um it's the best show entice best show

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,580
ever you know I mean it's one of a kind

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,560
I mean any other computer show you go to

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,200
what are the admissions like three four

00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:40,310
hundred dollars you know and this is uh

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,910
this is um free if you pre-register for

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:45,260
the enthusiast pass and if you're if

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,420
you're a walk and we're going to be

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:51,640
charging ten dollars for walkin fee

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:54,110
which is nominal and then we also have

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,520
professional training that's paid and

00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:00,470
that runs from 350 to 450 for the day

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,990
which is also very reasonable for

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,330
professional training so that happens

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:09,500
alongside the early to penguin track on

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,560
Friday so it's and you know what's a lot

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,210
of the the talks when you go in there

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,280
it'll say beginner immediate

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,910
intermediate so you know kind of what

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:23,420
you're getting into when you when you

00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:26,000
sign up so if you're bringing the lot or

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,800
lon a spouse or somebody who's only

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,750
marginally interested in computers

00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,590
there's enough interesting

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:37,950
talks to go to and by the way the the

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:41,540
keynotes tend to be a little bit more I

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,890
don't know what inclusive of the whole

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,520
community so that people who are not

00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,770
developers can can often get a lot of

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,160
pleasure and enjoyment out of coming to

00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:56,550
the keynotes there's a keynote Friday

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,040
evening one Saturday morning one

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,940
Saturday evening there's also a lot of

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:07,320
social things there there's a happy hour

convention center is and they're going

00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:45,930
to try to stream Richard Stallman from

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:48,690

so you guys are how long have you guys

00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,330
been working with the with the

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:37,620
conference um hmm let's see I think I

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:39,510
started maybe around 2000 for something

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,360
like that so I've been I've been

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,660
volunteering just kind of doing odd jobs

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:50,550
here and there and then for 4 last year

00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:53,010
and then this year we had a vacancy in

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,630
the speaker chair so that's that's what

00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,400
i've been doing so i get all the

00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,770
proposals that come in people that want

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,260
to give a talk and so we sit through

00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,270
them and and try to assemble everything

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,580
together into tracks and it's basically

00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,130
you know it's basically a job of you

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,350
know hurting about three dozen cats and

00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:14,550
getting them all getting them all lined

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:17,850
up yeah so I it's hard to tell when i

00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,380
started with ohio linux fest because my

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,410
daughter fell in love with it the very

00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,780
first year that's Beth lanai Kerr and

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,810
the second year she came back as a

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:31,460
volunteer and somehow that's morphed

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:34,380
into her actually being the whatever

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,570
administrative head of the Ohio linux

00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,000
fest if you'd like to know more about

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:42,450
the staff if you go to ohio linux fest

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,800
org i believe its front sesh staff you

00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:50,160
can see all the key players one or more

00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,300
is the conference chair this year like

00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,350
shultiess what's out our web page and so

00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,010
much more registration

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:02,740
you know there's so many people on

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:06,190
Skippy's doing the oh LOL fi the

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,480
professional training boy there's

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,260
somebody I'm sure that I'm not

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:14,919
mentioning that's me there yeah Carol's

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,470
doing logistics so we could actually use

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,940
more volunteers if you go to those quick

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,910
leaks in the beginning and there's a

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,799
there's a link that says volunteers we

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,270
do need to have succession planning for

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,820
those of us who are not getting any

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:31,150
younger we need to bring up some new

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,150
people too to start slow and then

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,429
probably move into leadership roles we

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:39,610
do have sort of a new volunteer that's

00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:43,600
um taking over the career track that has

00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:45,520
shepherded that Rafiq is it yes but how

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,559
I got involved is like my daughter kept

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,480
talking about this thing she was from

00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,760
Pittsburgh she came with western

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,919
Pennsylvania linux users group to

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,340
Columbus and the first year and just

00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:01,090
fell in love with it and after a few

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:03,820
years I started going to help out to

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,820
take lunch tickets and help register

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,460
people and do whatever and it wasn't

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:12,730
until about two thousand nine or 2010

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:16,600
that she said you know Mom you work at

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,630
the VA hospital and that electronic

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,370
medical record system that you're using

00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:25,270
vista is free and open source software

00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:27,340
and i thought wow I'm everyday im using

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,850
free and open source software and didn't

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,799
know it you know so so anyhow that led

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,610
me to present a medical track for two

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:41,169
years for open source medical programs

00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:42,909
but anyhow after that I kind of morphed

00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:46,090
in last year I morphed into doing the

00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:48,640
social media for Ohio linux fest so I'm

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:52,510
the person that puts out the tweets and

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:56,559
the and the Facebook posts and LinkedIn

00:30:52,510 --> 00:31:01,090
group posts and the Google+ posts and

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:04,990
and things like that so so sad a high Oh

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:08,650
linux is Aaron ah yeah that's yeah the

00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:12,430
the Twitter the twitter is at Ohio Linux

00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:15,100
and I think it's not ohio linux fest or

00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,200
something like that in mm-hmm in our

00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,390
Facebook if you search it you'll

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,670
actually come across the facebook page

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:25,990
and the Facebook group there's also a

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:27,880
Facebook group on facebook where people

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,580
can shatter a little bit back and forth

00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,410
and that would be really useful for

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,380
people that want to share rooms or rides

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,350
or you know want to talk about you know

00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,430
what's going on with the conference that

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,230
can go back and forth because

00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:45,970
unfortunately like all facebook pages

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,280
unless people comment when you put a

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,500
post for any page on the facebook page

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,450
it goes into that section comments by

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,610
others and who really reads those is

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:58,570
right i read those so right so we have a

00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:01,870
facebook group as well so um we do have

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:04,020
a pretty good following Google+ because

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,120
it seems like there are a lot of

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:09,190
technical people that still use Google+

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,310
and hopefully that won't go away too

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,870
soon but um well they just change the

00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,970
logo and everything so must be sticking

00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,470
around for a little bit so yeah I just

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,140
got all my updates across all my

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,360
iDevices so and actually even over on

00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,620
the on the Android too so I was waiting

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,090
for all those google actually no they

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,850
haven't changed all the Google logos on

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,220
my Android device and I'm a nexus just

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,380
noticed is you know those dots on the

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,390
right and Google that you click on it

00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,360
and you can get to youtube or whatever

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:40,600
they put one now for Google+ on that yea

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,570
which was always kind of a pain for me I

00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,610
had to log in as Susan rose and then I

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,830
had to go to my profile and then somehow

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:50,080
I got into Google+ that way now I can go

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,190
it's a mystery I want to use hangouts

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,560
more this is another ya podcast but yeah

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,630
because I was a setting up with a client

00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,730
I'm just like I forgot how much of a

00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,250
pain in the butt it is to use google

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,710
hangouts but yeah there's i have to

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,900
download that that software that

00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,150
it makes you download the road network

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,900
you know what i'd like to put out there

00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:17,650
that if anybody uploads something to

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:20,710
youtube or they are doing a periscope

00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:22,640
session at ohio linux fest please please

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,620
please let me know I mean you can

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,380
message me on Facebook you can email me

00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,230
or you can you know just put a social

00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:33,730
media post and I'll see it and I would

00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:36,470
like to congeal those in one place

00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,050
actually we do have a youtube channel

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:41,480
for ohio linux fest and it looks like

00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,790
there's only two videos there which is

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,630
kind of mistaken because when you go to

00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:52,520
the list we I have a conglomeration of

00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:56,390
everybody else's videos from ohio linux

00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,520
fest there so if you want to see what

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,440
the talks were like in a different year

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,410
or if you're preparing for a talk in a

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,940

to the YouTube channel go the list and

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:14,290
you can see some key notes you can see

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:20,600
some other people who have who have

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:22,970
uploaded their own talks so if you're if

00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,830
you have a company or whatever that's

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,909
very proud of you for doing it talk

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:31,550
please you know videotape yourself and

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:36,320
then let me know where you've uploaded

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:38,300
it to and we can uh we can put that in

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,120
our list and then we can go to social

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,570
media and advertise how many of the

00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:48,950
videos are on the YouTube list good good

00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:50,390
awesome awesome so last bits uh what a

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:53,649
way these are the deadline on

00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:56,000
registration for every way checking in

00:34:53,649 --> 00:35:00,380
regístrate register as soon as you can

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,320
the we usually cut it off somewhere

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:07,280
around maybe twenty four hours ahead of

00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,870
time something like that the probably

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,540
the the bigger thing that you're going

00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,980
to have to look into is is hotels a lot

00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:17,300
of the hotels that are connected right

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:20,780
to the convention center are sold out so

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:24,500
you can go to the hotels on page on on

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,300
ohio linux org and you'll see some some

00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,690
description of at least how things stood

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,100
as of a couple of days ago mm-hmm so I

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,860
yeah I advise you to check out the

00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,200
hotels and then go in and register as

00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,990
soon as you can it's it's pretty quick

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,109
as Susan was saying the the enthusiast

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:44,510
level of registration which is get you

00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:47,109
into all of the the talks on Saturday

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:51,829
and the early Penguins talks on Friday

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:55,190
that's free as long as you do it ahead

00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:58,579
of time and then the next level up is

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,119
the supporting level which is that

00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:04,130
essentially gets you the same thing

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:08,599
although it also gets you a t-shirt and

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:11,660
it gets you into the after party for for

00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,720
free and it's basically it's there you

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,450
know we you know we have a lot of

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,630
sponsors and we're very appreciative of

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,460
their help but it also you know if you

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,829
want to contribute a little bit too to

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,119
help keep things going that's always

00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:29,089
that's always helpful that's what the

00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,510
supporting package is therefore and then

00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:35,089
the and then the professional level is

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:38,119
the friday professional training that

00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:41,240
will be going on so that's that's

00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,460
probably of most used to people who have

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,849
some use professionally for these

00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,940
technologies the docker class is proving

00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:51,859
to be very popular so you may want to

00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,000
get in on there if you want to if you

00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:57,220
want to make sure that you get a space

00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,410
there we have ones on OpenStack as well

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:05,089
that's also a new container technology

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:07,790
and we also have a an OPI linux

00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:10,490
professional institute certification

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:13,670
cram class that's going to be going the

00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,990
OPI class is actually only 350 the other

00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,849
classes are 450 for the entire day I

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:23,180
yeah I wanted to mention that we're all

00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:25,640
volunteers here and the staff for all

00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,300
volunteers we're buying our own hotel

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,630
rooms we're buying our own t-shirts I

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,349
know of one at least who and registered

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,790
as a supporter just to support the

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:40,430
convention because of how much they

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,500
believe in it so it it's more than a

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:46,730
conference is it's something you can

00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,030
believe in and and so I wanted to I
