his response codes and then what the

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:09,210
circus peanuts let's test was over

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:12,570
learners but some tools to kind of make

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,000
requests and kind of dissect oh you know

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,640
all the requests out there and then

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,109
lastly we'll do closing Q&A things like

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:28,170
that so let's get started so so YH tpd

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,240
right why this topic I work in the

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,740
managed hosting field and what that

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,620
means is that you know we have our DC's

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,910
stock for servers and customers come to

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,370
us and they put your website on bigger

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,320
right the websites or applications in my

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,410
fat so it means it can be anything from

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,070
a basic lab step right linux apache

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,989
mysql PHP or any version of that stack

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,969
or can be a very customized

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,090
jellification job application they wrote

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,649
ten years ago we haven't touched since

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,199
so what that does is provides a lot of

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,460
will say opportunities right to

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,910
troubleshoot a lot of unique and

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,500
different things and what that why I

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,390
bring that up is cadet what that makes

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,520
us do is have to really understand

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,560
annoying protocols right cuz all these

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,570
applications all those services like

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,270
underlying protocol to all that is still

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,920
in HTTP request you brought the slides

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,900
up today you may an age to give advice

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,140
why you pull down files from a server so

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,060
so doing that by by my role there by Rho

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,150
by your current job is a lot of training

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,710
and mentoring and huge i get i found

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,450
myself being a lot of escalation saying

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,210
hey having these problems and what I

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:39,270
found out was that it really came down

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,799
to understanding of what the error codes

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,509
were or what the response codes were I

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,420
understanding equivocation actually

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,860
happened it worked so oh I decided to

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,930
look how to start to dig into and say

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,610
hey let's get really really bad debaters

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,159
on this right I'll take curious about

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:02,250
asking why how does this work why this

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:04,080
work right and so taking text down that

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,570
type of path saying let's look

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,860
very very basics right let's tell to a

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,570
server list art start to actually

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,370
communicate with a book all the way to

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,220
server would so it's kind of chances

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,750
with a presentation right so oh okay

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,460
this light is making sense anymore

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,440
there's a spongebob joke they pick out

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:27,060
so we'll go on right back out more about

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:32,790
the actual spongebob joke so so moving

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,420
on what is HPV right um and its basic

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,460
stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol I

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,330
think transfer broke off pretty much

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,310
self-explanatory right protocol being

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,680
the way that in this case a client has

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,780
several you gave each other transfer

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,520
right moving those things so the once in

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,480
there is hypertext kind of what I want

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,360
to talk about a little more I protect is

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,510
simply a medium or a document right that

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,280
links to another document all right

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,170
Olivia not deducting which often leads

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,750
to probably another document right so we

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,420
had navigate through various documents

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,310
through what's called hyperlinks right

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,750
so we go gold stuff right and you find

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,890
yourself going down with you no more

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,910
another document another document

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,560
another day

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,440
and then you have some like that

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,750
happening right closing ball reopen a

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,090
Firefox opens always in your Mac same

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,040
problem so essentially identical high

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,350
protected right it's a bare minimum to

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,250
medium that has links to other documents

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:38,020
so forth right okay so they have history

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,000
I was not the history buff I think it's

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,730
good at least some kind of reference

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,580
point to how long hgv hgv has been

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,500
around if you guys put the slide all of

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,960
these linked back to the actual RFC's

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,940
for those unfamiliar RFC is a request

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,560
for comments it basically describes the

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:58,660
way the protocol should be implemented

00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,910
right Oh keep effort key point there

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,820
should be ever minted right as we all

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,070
know to be mobile interpretations of an

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,880
IRC about the foundation right just

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:13,080
think about the way we render HTML in

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:17,620
firefox chrome IE right today so

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,390
starting off 926 with RFC 1945 define

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:26,260
the first kind of protocol for HTTP 10

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,430
then in 1999 we have won that one with

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,920
various improvements will talk about

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:37,210
that in a few slides in June point 14

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,620
the the actual procar the rc4 iht one

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,140
that one got broken out into all these

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,140
other articles here just be a bit more

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,180
special items like right so all of all

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:52,540
those rfcs their end up deprecating what

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,760
we see up there with 2616 okay again

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,200
just a bit of history those are

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,669
hyperlinks stairs you can connect you

00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,560
can actually click and link to the rit

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,480
itself be a bit more of you might get

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:07,110
really really down dirty with it right

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,000
get in the weeds bit so also HTTP to

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,960
this came out the spec came out actually

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,940
came out in may of this year may 2015 so

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,850
there's that whole lot out there talk

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,240
about i noted it that there is an RFC

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:26,640
for HTTP two it's based off of the

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,640
speedy protocol from google Oh

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,440
awesome oh also build go i bet you oh I

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:37,890
think they bought all the domains like

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,340
Oliver might three four or five so yeah

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:45,510
hello so based on speedy essentially

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,760
it's a way to speed up how HTTP handles

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,070
with requests and transfers data between

00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,440
client server I'm not analyzing too much

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,460
more than that it is out there just Pat

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,900
Darcy same stuff so I think in genetics

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,240
you can use within genetics so much

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,920
about that yet but pretty sure it's next

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,720
to be use of it so um alright so play it

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,310
back a little bit completely the big

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,740
ones kind of what you see the most often

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,590
right I chose it specifically in kind of

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,510
talk about HTTP 10 verses 11 in this

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,370
case when we see most often right at

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,750
least one given when I go back to teach

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,910
the text on the floor i'll give them

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,460
some background on what was the

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,780
improvements right so a number of

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,630
improvements or three big ones i want to

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,710
highlight here are the first one they

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,720
depart hitter okay every quest for HTTP

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,420
one dot one requires a host header i'll

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,550
talk about what that means a bit further

00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,850
on essentially it is the website i want

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:45,660
from that server okay it allows for

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,630
persistent connections with HTTP 10 in

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,250
the past every pension was a new every

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,590
request with a new connection I wanted a

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,450
website go on a page request I was a

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,830
catch I want an image from the page a

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,870
new connection right so what does that

00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,940
mean that means a lot of overhead okay

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,770
so with one that one week an improvement

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,570
there we can make multiple quest to the

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,330
server without having to continually

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,630
build up build up and break down dead

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,000
that's soccer at fort ok and then lastly

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,710
implemented a hundred level if michelle

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,530
status codes which I'll talk about again

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:22,620
a bit further on okay a bit more HTTP

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,330
itself st of yourself is stateless so

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,890
what does that mean that means that

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,440
every request should have enough

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,880
information to complete that request

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,240
where dollars of any requests that come

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,890
before it or after it right so every

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,110
request obviously this more to our API

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,409
is right we have it in request that

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,969
makes us every

00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:43,059
be something or get separation from a

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:45,099
server that you want so that being said

00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:46,929
right with we all know web now is

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:49,629
sessions that you can log in you have

00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:53,019
memory great there is persistence index

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,179
of how is it happened right happens

00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,459
through a number of ways the first off

00:07:55,179 --> 00:08:00,039
being cookies right cookies feed on the

00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:02,349
client side or sessions on the server

00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,589
side I make the point into it here just

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:07,050
because maybe more point that what we do

00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,209
have sessions we could have persistence

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,339
within in kind of a account smelting

00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,749
online that's not part of the protocol

00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,939
itself that's implemented in your

00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:19,449
application side or server side okay so

00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:22,149
it's in addition to that there alright

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,059
so high five my HTTP any kind of big

00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:28,089
general sense okay so much Belize

00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:29,409
methods right I'm looking at only some

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:33,009
of the methods kind of wondered about

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:35,019
the most often necessarily all of them

00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:40,750
right because we only have about 40

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:43,269
minutes or so so the first one here all

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,860
right first three ms no o'clock is on

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,560
again methods but you won't so negative

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,939
adverbs okay look over the actions so

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,329
the first one can be these safe method

00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:53,560
these methods are implement in a sense

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,790
that they are non-destructive right

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,649
there just informational getting things

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,660
back from the server or you go ahead get

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,689
and get options about those three first

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,910
okay these messages are these methods

00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:07,209
are also idempotent so what does that

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,959
mean kind of interesting we're up there

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:13,170
i oppose d it is is a sort of looking

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,170
for

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,210
it's a trick right of a function that no

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,820
matter how come you run that function

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,310
you think too that expect back the same

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,310
result multiple times so what's an

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,190
example of that example of that might be

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,860
a fraud and link system and well

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,080
actually we do a request for index HTML

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,940
we can make the same request over and

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,900
over and over and expecting the same

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,450
result right example Oh a non Idaho

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,820
request or actually be Adelina file

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,250
right I did file once I can't run that

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,600
same function over and over over expect

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,920
the same results right they same exact

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,680
function so as the difference we

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,089
instance I Boden's and that's not okay

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,100
play-doh make know that these these

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,750
requests are meant to be just that same

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,910
request can get expect to have the same

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:06,660
response over okay Oh example let's see

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:10,120
my first kiss I just can get this so i

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,089
thinkI decimals are not elaborate and

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,860
not really that drawn out but i have

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,360
them up here because i want at least two

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,529
have something back you guys go back in

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,820
with the slides either on another

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,910
reference point of what they look like

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,980
right also you ever had your event IP

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,110
and something over your shoulder

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,220
immensely orly right now imagine when

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,230
there's 40 people with you people

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:35,050
looking actually typing doesn't go well

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,820
so i did a video so we'll do here is go

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,740
we're going to get here is example to

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,600
get requests what i'm doing here is it

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,520
basically tell knitting to a server on

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:50,800
port 80 what we'll see here can you do

00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:53,050
the lights I do not know I make the font

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,360
bigger I can have me the father bigger a

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,360
committee in the newsroom recording

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:10,560
yeah it's a little off guys right we're

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:14,550
fine here here all right I'm not gonna

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,190
fall this stage so anyway it isn't that

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,270
we're we're telling it to port 80 what

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,390
I'm giving them get I do a get request

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:25,020
as you see here Hall is that what it

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:30,780
looks like here again / okay hold on my

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:32,190
Thursday right so get / inch DP 0 / 10

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,760
right so this is a one-time / request

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:37,830
okay I'm on it I'm which you can see

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
here is where week request right hit

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,460
enter to send request off and I get to

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,000
my content back now notice immediately

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,290
how my kitchen was closed off okay so

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,750
it's very simple but I think the example

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,640
I mean again didn't get requests real

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:57,300
quick here i got my do i highlight one

00:11:50,640 --> 00:12:00,240
more step back here what's kinda nice is

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,360
that if you get to copy and paste from

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,150
this cuoco video let's go ask instead of

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,410
montana's anyway breaking down right

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,250
here also so this right here would be

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,480
your actual request so that's lastly i'm

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,670
requesting you'll just kind of the

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,670
document root by getting requests in

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,470
your site HTML oh and you five th p CSS

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,000
file an image just funny thing right

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,360
that's kind of that portion go is the

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,760
part that URL okay and we'll just let it

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,760
run through again just for the sake of

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,480
brother demo twice I'm very long I said

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:37,620
awesome cool we have an undead alright

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,780
so ahead request so a get request who

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,670
asked for information from a server and

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,160
get the resulting payload from that

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,860
server gets the hilton document or image

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,950
or CSS or content essentially ahead

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,630
requests essentially ask for just the

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,480
response you would get from the server

00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,340
but not the actual content this is good

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,340
for checking to see if a server is

00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,710
redirecting you or the server is having

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,600
error each might get back responsible so

00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,410
we'll see here in this case here what

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,779
you're going to fight which you can

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,569
highlight wepa highlight here

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,579
eh to be that one that one request and

00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,800
we'll see here how the attention isn't

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,149
immediately closed that she kept open

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,439
for us I've been mentioned earlier than

00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:22,100
different that persistent connection

00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:25,209
right so we'll see closely here all

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:30,439
right so tell that right for that I owe

00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:32,540
or 80 so instead of yet we had first

00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:34,279
time we do the head request you see here

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,809
composite books with you get there it

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,790
I'm seeing here is I've been doing it a

00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:40,399
different agric Westhead request same

00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,180
reason the same resource right to /

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,959
which server translates to index HTML

00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,370
has by default and then HTTP 11 I also

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,509
mentioned that one of the requirements

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,540
of HTTP 11 was I needed a host header

00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,639
okay and such all it is is telling the

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,009
server of all the sides do that one this

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,990
server I want this one back right this

00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,790
is what I went back will notice here

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,439
that make that request I don't get the

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,999
content back all I get back to the

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,610
response from the server saying it's

00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:12,170
okay it looks good but also notes like

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,720
actually been kept open it wasn't

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,420
immediately closed right so again that's

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:25,910
part of that that improvement from one

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:27,610
died 08 01 alright then see here one

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,129
more example of you can lights back on

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,529
all right options so options are options

00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:35,120
request to a server some service and

00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,740
disable is some summers don't like you

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,870
having this out there so we'll say

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,790
nothing but it's okay to say hey what

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,980
can I request can I make to this server

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,079
hey so it's on what that doesn't look

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,360
here again we're doing a request for one

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:51,230
that one see that here how the catch is

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,110
also kept open so how much using telnet

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,970
has one tool I'll talk later on in a few

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,160
more slides about old you can use to

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,899
kind of make this bit more streamlined

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,920
okay we're helping out that the also

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,509
sort of allies other place I think of

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,209
our hosted its requirement for every

00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,000
request from there and we see down here

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,600
that we have our options are

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,640
to head request or I get request right

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,640
both which we saw examples of earlier on

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:32,370
alright we can do lights now on if we so

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:35,460
choose we came up you'll find sleeping

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:39,210
more than that we would all right 7 I've

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:43,280
been pumped to see other man oh all

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,280
right other methods here actually let me

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,980
f1 students with his other one the first

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,260
one first up at lunch in the last one of

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,380
the hard ones oh alright so other

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,850
methods put in post so to this point and

00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,490
funk in five methods to get information

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,290
from a server right get an admission

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,060
from my work information or game okay

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,220
get content from a server or gained

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,040
freshman from the server by the response

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,420
code or about what we can ask of it

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,160
these two methods are about sending

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,840
information to the server give the

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,070
server emission that it can process and

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,810
deal with so to hear put and post both

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,540
of them are fairly similar both of them

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:24,000
situation to a server with like for

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,550
example index dot PHP or application dot

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,980
PHP and that there is only one payment

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,340
is expected to be able to due process

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,800
that data right so the first one here

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,860
I'll put request but the main difference

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,930
between the two is in the way that data

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,720
is submitted with a put request

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,270
information is submitted via the you are

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,800
the URI as we see here in a key value

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:53,280
pair we have domain com index dot PHP

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,700
and then I have a poor restring Cindy an

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,830
exe here and key value pair user first

00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,950
name last name then we have Johnny

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,570
record right that's kind of those values

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,030
you would see this as part of the string

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:09,209
your browser Teresa gets into the server

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,760
the next one would be a post request

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,220
again very similar but instead of it

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,680
being in the URI it is part of the

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,660
actual request body pretty simple I

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,760
think it's do demos of these so I don't

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,130
have them if your future version will

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,930
have that up there so really the good

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,920
thing once like me online and kind of in

00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,420
a web page plant

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,770
you get those demos up and running I'll

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,040
put them up here you can find them later

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:37,400
on so these kind of type of living

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:43,070
presentation you can take updated every

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:46,130
so often yeah okay cool so those are all

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,350
of the methods we request the fur but

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,690
the apps we can do the surgery so about

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,270
something else here let's talk about the

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,110
headers we've already seen 100 right

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,890
Corey seen the host header right so

00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,810
there's a lot about different up there

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,730
click on that link to Wikipedia get a

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,190
ton of different headers out there um

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,730
but essentially what hitters are see

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,160
here I there we go I have slides I were

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,740
a little bit Oh such a header it

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,170
describes additional information about

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,510
the client and the server right so we

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:21,620
have hairs on full size there's my quiet

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:24,560
I have is from the server okay so a few

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,120
limits here awesome the first thing we

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,590
saw here is I posted it we saw that in

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,930
the example right that's why i define

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,580
from my one box wonder of the hundreds

00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:34,820
of sites that it has which one I went

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,620
back right it defines that hostname

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,380
satire that's how fat she knows hey give

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,520
me domain com not domain data work right

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,110
for example that word hmm me instead I

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,390
go these are these are headers from the

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,520
client to the server these are applied

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,260
these are headers that more often not

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,260
your browser is setting off for you

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,780
right so first ones host second one

00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,030
would be user agent right this is

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,190
information about your browser your OS

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,470
things like that that gets into the

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,560
server as well very curious what yours

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,700
is you can click on the link there and

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,920
bring it up right quick mission your

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:15,290
browser send me off about you all right

00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,840
next one except this tells the server

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,070
what types of content that I can sit

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,860
back through the bra from the brothers

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:27,280
oh whoa okay

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:29,110
years so yeah this does this does this

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,840
is a client saying hey when you send

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,760
information back I prefer in this for my

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,050
purse in that format right or I prefer

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,210
it in this language versus a bad

00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:42,220
language if it's up to do that now so

00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,870
all those word those all those were

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,390
headers from the client to the server

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,760
let's talk about from the server the

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,460
client okay and we'll do a demo where

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,720
you see all these came back and forth

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,520
part of the tools section more demos

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,420
most things right to gotta get some some

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,890
reference point around it alright so the

00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:02,380
first one they sent off this enough is

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,780
the server header right I this sort of

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,540
identify itself as what server and

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,090
version it is um this is useful it is

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,640
absolutely very useful many times we get

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,290
a ticket or alert at work and we get

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,450
back as a load balancer right which had

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,970
him Tony site times we're not straight

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,000
best sites hosted on the windows side

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,800
look excited okay we can do a request to

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,170
the server get back the information that

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,960
says is not our problem right you can on

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,240
Windows team if it says Apache okay

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,790
maybe our problem right maybe not in

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,950
genetics probably our problem we had

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,360
case one time where customer was

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,670
complaining site but not working too

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,590
much work it was he says my sights on

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,640
this server it's not working on the

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,920
server and start looking at it right

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,030
well we make changes I think nothing

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,590
happens make changes again anything

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,820
happens then sir that will just look at

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,400
the requested like if you look at the

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,530
browser itself not add you know the

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,530
actual content like that or that matter

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,810
the protocol itself so we find something

00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,640
hey pilla tech go ahead and just you

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,850
request through your command line do a

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,460
curl do a whatever and get rushing back

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,130
walking back instead Apache let's do it

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,660
okay fine only problem was that's right

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,550
demonstrating University it was it came

00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,860
back and said engine X Michael gets

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:17,260
probably our server because over on tour

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,990
in Apache 19x at all he had moved the

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,970
site to a node server and told no one so

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,610
here we are sitting troubleshooting the

00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,310
server because he was going up Rio is

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,370
still get the technology

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,840
it'll decide right so a simple thing

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,800
rabbit can be helpful to find out make

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,890
sure you work on the right server first

00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,120
save you time will save you time you

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,630
type that mean time I are good numbers

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,450
say oh so yeah it's just a little story

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,730
there cache-control right this tells the

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,770
the service of server telling the client

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,680
hey you can go and keep this around

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:53,970
floaters right maybe this is a CSS file

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,820
or I followed in exchange for y'all that

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,800
javascript file maybe it's a jquery

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,240
framework that you get from google and

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,160
you just download it right this many

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,660
sites do the same framework go and keep

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,490
this around don't download a game you

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,700
have to write so as this the service

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,590
telling us easy to set the server for

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,640
things like images or JavaScript or

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,020
files are going to just don't change

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,570
very often right here content cookie

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,240
right this is a servant tone the client

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:24,510
when i'm cindy has been encoded through

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,140
Jesus or deflate any other encoding type

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,460
right and lastly as well the content

00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:37,140
type what I'm sending you is going to be

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:39,540
this time oh so other hands right so so

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,700
something Sam is are non-standard we see

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,550
these most often we talk about a proxy

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,140
in front of multiple web hits okay in

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,120
our environment this is with that proxy

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,250
would be a load balancer load balancers

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,950
attaching inject the entire interior

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,630
request saying x-forwarded-for export

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,880
host and then an IP address right the

00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,760
bridge my patrons again this is for I

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,260
said it's going to be we have a low

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,330
balance or some sort of proxy in front

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,170
of a number of web heads right because

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,560
you want to know what the original

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,900
request came from not requests were

00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,180
looking out for a great party use for

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,310
ads tracking when we're customers come

00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:18,170
from right all those things useful know

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,170
