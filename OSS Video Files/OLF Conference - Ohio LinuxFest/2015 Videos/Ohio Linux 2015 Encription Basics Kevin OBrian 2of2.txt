so it's pretty clear that the NSA forced

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:15,000
this process into choosing as the

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:18,600
default the curve that is deliberately

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,180
weakened that does not mean that the

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,240
approach of elliptic curve encryption is

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,539
bad it means that this particular

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,070
default curve is bad you can still use

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:34,140
elliptic curve and in fact I think we

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,270
should be looking at it it is faster and

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,550
more efficient than the alternatives so

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,899
it really does make sense I think this

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:51,300
is going to be the future of this

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:55,410
algorithm now symmetric versus

00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:00,059
asymmetric symmetric is fast and

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:04,979
efficient but needs no entropy but it

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:07,860
has key exchange problems asymmetric is

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:12,530
resource intensive requires randomness

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:18,930
but it solves the key exchange problem

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:26,960
well what can we do with that let's

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:32,159
encrypt the symmetric key all right so

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,860
if you're using take a simple you know

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,490
you're encrypting an email you know you

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,680
got PGP setup or gpg whatever you like

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,680
to use they're functionally equivalent

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:50,159
it's i'm going to encrypt my email what

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:56,490
is it doing it is generating a symmetric

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:59,119
key that then encrypts the email and

00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,119
then

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:08,810
uses the asymmetric key to encrypt the

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,980
symmetric and so remember the way that

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:16,480
works is that there are two keys in

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:20,360
asymmetric designated public and private

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,760
so if I want to communicate with my

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,739
friend Tom over there all I need to do

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,569
is say Tom here's my public key in fact

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:34,190
iona give it tom i'll give it to give

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:39,079
i'll give it to everybody I've got to

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,720
published on my website similarly if I'm

00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,610
dealing with Tom and say Tom tell me

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,180
what your public key is because I'm a

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:51,079
didn't want to send you something so mom

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,610
gives me his publisher so I want to send

00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:58,370
a message i grabbed his public key

00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:03,410
create the message it's encrypted using

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,760
a symmetric key and then that symmetric

00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,639
key is encrypted using Tom's public key

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,600
and I can send it to him and then tom

00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,760
says oh I'll use my super secret private

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:22,190
keen nobody knows about that will

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:24,019
decrypt all of this but once he's

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,700
decrypted the key everything else

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:35,450
happens using the symmetric key so it's

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:37,010
much more efficient that way now one of

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,530
the things that's wonderful about this

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:44,109
is that we use the same technology over

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,579
and over so you want to take a look at

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,150
ssl-certificates a better presentation

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:52,400
on that maybe I'll offer that next year

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,769
it's basically doing the same thing only

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,290
now what you're doing is you're trying

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,540
to create a connection between your

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,599
computer and a server out on the

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:08,060
internet you want to secure encrypted

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:11,640
connection so what happens well the

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,810
server has a public key

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,540
and it offers you that public key and

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,940
then you can use that to create a secure

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,120
connection through which they can then

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,830
send you a symmetric key and then they

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,310
use the symmetric key for the rest of

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:33,380
the session so that's how that works

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:37,290
take a look at SSH tunnels same thing

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,770
you'll use the asymmetric public/private

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,720
key pair to establish a connection

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,700
through which you can then send a

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,330
symmetric key and then you use this

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,460
symmetric key for the balance of your

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,660
session because that's so much more

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,790
efficient so once you learn the

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,970
fundamentals of this stuff it applies

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:04,380
everywhere ya know okay i guess i didn't

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:14,320
have to worry about whether i'd run out

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:17,010
of time questions and slide about email

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,010
sure

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,870
ok

00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:20,409
wait could be no that happened to do

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:26,710
that what was that he with that I don't

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:28,780
remember the name of it offhand probably

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,460
if you went to the NIS t website you

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:47,289
would probably get a reference to it it

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:51,279
was just within you know are you

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:53,110
interested in a deep dive technically

00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:59,740
into the mathematics of how to construct

00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:03,340
ciphers ok maybe you could through our

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:14,620
textbooks on cryptography Bruce Schneier

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:22,060
has written one of them understand me

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:24,190
cryptography yeah yeah yeah there's

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,550
actually a book of bruises that I like a

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,990
lot war and it's not the technical one

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,900
it's a book that he wrote called the

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:39,370
fear and I like it beyond fear and he

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,449
wrote this in like 2003 partly as a

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,129
response to 2001 9 11 and basically

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,189
saying you know everyone's running

00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:53,800
around like crazy doing things that are

00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:56,139
stupid and so he lays out a way of

00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,099
thinking about this stuff that I think

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:02,589
is very good where you start with what's

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:06,250
the threat you're trying to guard

00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:09,939
against start with that you find the

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:12,159
threaten you care about and then based

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:16,409
on that does your countermeasure

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,409
actually address that threat

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:24,810
so for instance i apply that i did a

00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:27,000
presentation recently on last pass and

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,569
why the last pass hack was nothing that

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,690
concerns me particularly because they

00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:36,750
could actually done a pretty good job of

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:39,510
doing security on their end but i

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,610
started from the starting point is if i

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,039
use a password manager like LastPass

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,560
what is the threat I'm guarding against

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:51,269
the threat I am guarding against is

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,550
someone like cracking the office of

00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:57,300
personnel management and getting 35

00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:00,329
million logins that's the kind of thing

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,700
I'm worried about and it's like well you

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,810
know I'm worried about the NSA and it's

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:09,680
like okay if the NSA has targeted you

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,680
you have a different problem

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:17,660
and in that case i would say study

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:25,420
Edward Snowden the way a rabbi study

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,420
scripture he so far has not screwed up

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:36,050
everyone gets one Tom dis accounting as

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,880
you said like modular matt panics yaya

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,070
like the diffie-hellman there's a

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,839
youtube channel called the art of the

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,450
problem as a title of the channel

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,330
advised by britt cruces is khan academy

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,320
contributor and content producer

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,420
absolutely the most hands down

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,640
simplistic explanations for cryptography

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,260
you know the key exchange has happen all

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,970
in plain english and he's so produced

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,400
the videos for crown Academy but his

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,650
entire series of mathematics videos

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,200
which are all free on YouTube oh I

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,730
didn't understand a mod as well from

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,470
reading it versus when I watch his

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,240
youtube videos I'm like makes sense now

00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,220
I said I've gone through all those are

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,779
really really well done to give you a

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,640
clear understanding how the key exchange

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,140
words how perfect forward secrecy works

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,700
and some of the basis of mathematics

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,500
that go into this it gives you a lot of

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,120
detail with her it's amazing in 15

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,800
minutes you'll have you understanding to

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,050
be holding exchange on the blue paint

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,760
colors it's not it's really well

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,890
presented really well animated and

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
everything order the problem art the art

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,920
of the problem this is a mutagen

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,029
fortunately does not take youtube

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,010
channel all this so does not publish

00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,570
your Khan Academy but is still there are

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,779
these interesting guys going to read it

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,220
bottoms up prit britt cruise the google

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,200
his name it come on Pat crews kind of

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,040
family you can read talk about some of

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,110
the stuff these work

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,930
you get a Kickstarter to create a whole

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,410
other video series for more explaining

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,570
your geography for people to understand

00:10:50,410 --> 00:11:00,500
okay could you repeat the address of

00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:08,019
your website z as in zebra w i L and as

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:11,779
in Nancy I k calm calm I own the domain

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:14,000
so since a lot of me problems are like

00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:16,040
sis at mins making a mistake is there

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,680
like any sort is kinda like a pilot's

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,899
checklist of you know creating the key

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,449
properly how to secure it properly type

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:28,250
reference in while they professor takes

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,230
you to a chuckling every time you make

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:36,440
sure they not dropping these go

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:46,009
I haven't thought about them that would

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:50,990
be interesting some of these photography

00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:53,060
techniques particularly RSA III didn't

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,769
quite catch all of that what was the if

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,560
somebody were to prove the Riemann

00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:07,130
hypothesis ah would eventually that I

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:11,449
kept the faintest idea I would my guess

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:14,029
is that as with quantum cryptography if

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:20,060
I can be used to break a code it can be

00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:21,589
used to create one he saw so far it you

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,220
know if you just treat it as an arms

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:31,360
race that has worked to understand all

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,360
of this yeah

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:59,760
yeah yeah until head start rolling it

00:12:49,380 --> 00:13:06,360
will continue well you know if you start

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:09,900
seeing CIOs doing the perp walk on their

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,580
way to a federal penitentiaries see I

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,779
also suddenly start taking this stuff

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:22,050
seriously the problem is when not to cio

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:26,250
CEOs the problem is doing it costs money

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:29,970
it costs effort takes resources to do

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:34,320
proper security we've got a pretty good

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,150
idea how to do it it's just getting the

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,760
people who control the purse strings to

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:45,480
say yeah this is worth doing all right

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,209
right now as far as I can tell no point

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,420
of sale terminal in the world is

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:54,420
remotely safe it seems like every week

00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,670
I'm seeing another point of sale the

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,000
problem I mean it was just this little

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,220
past week who is alway hilton hotel

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,070
properties you know if you went to a

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,839
restaurant at the hilton hotels your

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,459
credit card may be bad on that point I

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,890
heard this must be any standard for a

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,750
point of sale stuff where the those

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,170
cards are you require to have a chip

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:21,450
it's actually as of Thursday that's

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,760
supposed to be the case it'll just to

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:27,870
have established a one-time used token

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,170
that we run transaction so no no company

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,170
will ever

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,649
yeah how many people have seen all of

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,260
their credit cards convert over to chip

00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:48,920
there's a few i checked my wallet the

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:51,529
other day none of mine sir how does that

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,300
work online that you can pin you still

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,620
have to get some problem and so if you

00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,660
take a look at Europe where they've had

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,870
chip and pin for a while what it does is

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,110
it cuts down on the fraud at point of

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:09,230
sale but does not cut down on fraud

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:17,660
issues online no I don't think it's our

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:19,250
chip there's been a lot of on top

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,769
of course of our bigger three-letter

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,620
agencies here in the US about them

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:30,459
mandating the use of back doors and read

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,459
fiction routine B's and C's that going

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:45,500
not well we're just 19 11 away from

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,569
throwing away any roadblocks in the way

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,209
of those three-letter agencies because

00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:56,990
as soon as there's an incident oh my god

00:15:50,209 --> 00:16:01,250
do whatever you have to do so yeah I

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:04,519
don't see I don't see that one run being

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:07,670
very effective so and that's why I think

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,680
what we can do is we take control of

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,680
that when we do our own encryption

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,889
because if I have chosen a good strong

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,540
encryption method I'm communicating with

00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,209
Tom who is smart enough to have a good

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:26,029
strong encryption method I know I can

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,680
communicate securely and the NSA will

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,920
get nothing better blob of a random

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
noise

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:49,360
well then we should all do it you know

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:54,430
I'm old enough to remember back in 1976

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:57,430
there was a Bicentennial and it was a

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,410
big rally in washington and someone was

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:04,209
circulating a petition about I don't

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:06,400
remember was about now but one of the

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,100
organizers get up on stage and said I

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,410
understand some of you are concerned

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:14,050
that if you sign this petition you will

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,300
have an FBI file instead one question

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:21,760
why the hell don't you have an FBI file

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:36,940
now I'm pretty sure I've had one for 40

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:40,380
years oh they're they're working on it

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,780
now it's it's devilishly difficult

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,410
because what we're seeing is yet we can

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,870
do quantum computing and do calculations

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:53,050
of you know we can factor three-digit

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,640
numbers with a quantum computer that's

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,910
cooled to like two degrees above

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:02,980
absolute zero okay there's some

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:04,809
engineering theories there but the

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,660
engineering is going to take a lot

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:10,540
another piece of that recently a six

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,510
million dollar consortium was put

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,120
together between MIT and a half type up

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,150
these work

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,010
that's very painful how you scale up

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,870
something where you can do you know in

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,620
the head of a pen into something you can

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,620
use practically

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,210
I'm sorry I didn't hear the first part

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:57,020
that's an interesting question yes I do

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:58,910
for some things I think the thing about

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,370
full system encryption I'm going to go

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,920
back to the the Bruce Schneier approach

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:09,680
what is the threat that you wish to

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:13,370
guard against if you regularly cross the

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,280
border you want to think about that on

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,190
the other hand generally speaking you

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,590
can be legally compelled to decrypt when

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,290
you cross the border or they may not let

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,570
you cross the border a lot of issues

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:32,740
there and you have to think about you

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,980
know is this the hill I want to die on

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:40,220
now as to how to do it if you're using

00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:47,060
linux you're probably still safe with

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:51,020
truecrypt it has been forked vera crypt

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:57,200
is being actively developed if you were

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:59,390
on Windows the truecrypt driver windows

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,480
driver they ran into some problems there

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:08,030
so basically get a privilege escalation

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:11,200
out of it considered bad so but you know

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,580
if you're not using windows and you know

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,470
if you're using windows and you're

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,680
concerned about security I have to

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,680
question

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:34,290
yes when I worked for the state of

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:39,480
Michigan I was required to use it I you

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:41,370
know you are trusting your security to

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,360
encryption that you don't know anything

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:50,250
about and that's if you can't if you

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,620
can't look at the code you don't know we

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,660
just saw that with Volkswagen you know

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,929
none of that would have happened if the

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:06,630
code was open so to me the takeaway is

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:11,059
open code makes us all safer okay are we

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,059
