house cargo Ohio becomes immediately

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,340
long background next stretch is

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,800
downloading pretty much interpreting

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,710
characterizing circumventing network

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,619
traffic rooster i watch that that

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,920
reflecting pool the opening sequence at

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,630
the Washington Mall smooth legs while

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,119
services getting all the day that needs

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,359
in order to play back the video highest

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,519
resolution on the other hand at least on

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,579
occasion when I access my cloud server I

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
don't get the same experience it's much

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,890
much much worse than getting orders back

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,010
to read less than what it is and I can't

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,930
really tell you involved happens I just

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,860
know that it happens and when it happens

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,210
i've known i did this so when i ran

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,660
across and i realize that this situation

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,280
is happening more than once hoping

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,399
against hope I open the ticket against

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,899
my cloud service provider saying

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,340
essentially I understand that you

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,870
usually give me gigabit service to

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,149
pretty much anywhere I want to access

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,170
are you by chance filtering the data

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,150
coming

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,580
something you know that small portions

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,380
of that and they wrote back and close

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,700
the tickets saying well very

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,890
professionally they said no we're not

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,450
doing that we've kind of hear that

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:21,850
ground why would we do that we park

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:25,540
supercharger for bandwidth really so

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:34,540
with a heavy heart called my internet

00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:36,040
service provider texting for and i told

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,990
them i have a problem is not all the

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,750
time but sometimes when it happens is

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,940
bad can you help they said what's your

00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,470
network look like mess well i have stuff

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,150
i really don't know where even saw my

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,640
network what I have very much stuff was

00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,080
something they said well the workstation

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,520
interview working with today we're going

00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,160
to bubble problem isn't physically

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,930
connected to your router well my house

00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:06,220
is over the ethernet you know most of

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:10,509
the stuff i have is she says well I need

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,550
you to be part connected as well okay I

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,380
can do that I can take my workstation I

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,150
have a 50 foot cable it's long enough

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,850
that I'm going downstairs plugged into

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:22,210
our run it up the stairs to the second

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,490
floor puberty's when these the rudder is

00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,930
in the hallway through the door across

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,760
the room

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,440
that's okay we've been blogging that's

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,660
fine it turns out that's the problem

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,640
I'll wiring into the house but for that

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,910
looks fine which is it okay now we can

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:47,030
proceed next step is there anything else

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:51,660
connected on Ella has been disconnected

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,060
okay right now my family I don't live

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,460
long my family has kind of do this

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,800
feeling about what their network

00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,990
situation is like if I do this that

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,770
feels we become a lot less nebulous

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,180
norwalk more focused acne we can do this

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,130
especially since we're talking about a

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,330
transient problem it's very less than

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,470
that of course of this session you're

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,380
not going to see if we're going to come

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,690
back to that led to a very cheerful

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,350
final question from my tech support very

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,970
soon and end of what is probably the

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,740
shortest tech support call I've ever

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:27,600
have in my isp with no resolution now I

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,950
can't fault them for doing this I can't

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,770
fault it for doing it that way if I

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,420
would design the process to keep up

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,300
something like this with a person on the

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,150
other end unknown problems and a person

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,220
who unknown

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,510
nobody's i would probably design same

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,599
process but unless your problem is

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,269
catastrophic or very chronic this is not

00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,579
going to be successful am i take away

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,319
from this was that if this problem is

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,180
going to fix their one and only one

00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,579
person was responsible for detecting it

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,040
that fly to resolve social for it and

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,629
actually solve that personal asleep

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,590
nobody else can help thinking that cross

00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,730
society with myself so i propose to you

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,319
and if you're having any problems on

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,019
your network connection is also your

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
sole responsibility to do anything there

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,639
is to do about fixing it and finding the

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,370
right thing to do and fix it so if you

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:19,870
buy that at premise but we can you

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,810
prepare to answer these questions about

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,130
the issues you're having problem with a

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,600
hardware failure in your network

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,220
something you need to be replaced is

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,229
that a servicemen terrific this

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,310
configuration on your in your system or

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,680
somewhere else is the problem congestion

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,229
not on the travel shape you need bail

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,120
answer that much where is the problem is

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,050
a global to your local network is it

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,490
between your closet and the pole is it

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,770
your local neighborhood everybody

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:52,389
associated with situation with the logo

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,979
service is it is py or is it a peering

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,900
point between the isp and whatever

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,560
service that you're having trouble we

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,419
need veiled answer when is is it tied to

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,820
some time a day or day a week is it time

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,289
to some other action that happens is it

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,669
poor related to something else that

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,060
you're doing or somebody else is going

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:12,099
on the network even know that who is it

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,470
if you have a problem with the site is

00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:18,760
your problem with that site is a problem

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,990
the set of sex with a problem all sex if

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,949
you're not gonna be able to do about the

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,490
problems we're going to answer that

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,810
question and the most important question

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,190
everything and everything else isn't

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,110
leading up to

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,240
in that you need to know what's the

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,000
right thing to do next to fix this

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,010
problem is the right thing to do to

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,900
repair that brow lift you have that

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,000
turns out that Unicorn everything that

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,440
you have is wrong is the right thing to

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,330
do call tech support and tell them

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,640
specifically I have this problem this

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,630
level you need to fix this thing at this

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,370
point is the right thing to do to say to

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,350
them to vote with your feet can go to go

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,640
to another service provider because you

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,550
know that this is not going to get fixed

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,350
at your level or and you found the

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,150
network neutrality problems the time to

00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,210
equip the pitchforks the new net down on

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,250
us and when we solve it that way you

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,510
better have proven at the same time

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,070
there's another class of questions that

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,940
you really need to have the answer to if

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,510
you're going to be able to do this

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,310
effectively I thought I met the surf at

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,620
the ice Peter had there's different

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,050
levels of service on high st offers 20

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,180
minutes and 30 minutes you know the

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,380
three beg Vince's percent better than 20

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,300
megabits or is it pretty much exactly

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,310
the same not a single question to answer

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,320
and it's not all those for the answers

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,570
you should know the answer to that and

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,490
the last week I've seen I've seen lots

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,730
of news about service caps showing up

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,500
again with the FBI SP level at some

00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,419
point people in this room may have to

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,980
care about that do you know how much

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,930
data you're using a neural network

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,500
network I imagine you doing with John

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,970
total service but I have no idea go into

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,250
this how much data i was losing and

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:59,919
whether i would care about 300 gigabytes

00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:01,600
service Capernaum and like i said why

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,689
the choices go competition of do you

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,330
know competitions

00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,279
I mean it's big deal to switch

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,339
competition when it happened in my house

00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,429
the new service couple of hours devoted

00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:16,909
service so it's not something that

00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:18,799
easily switch between fermenting the

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:20,419
abilities for me anyway except for the

00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:21,919
first question of do have a problem the

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:27,319
answer for that's everything else here

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,579
was I don't and so I believe that the

00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,689
answer is you need to take it upon

00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:33,769
yourselves in order to answer these

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,599
questions and I propose a five-step plan

00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:39,039
in order to get to the point where you

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,959
are knowledgeable about what's going on

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,059
if basically three states do this one is

00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,069
getting ready going to test second this

00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:50,239
task and Ferb to do some of the battery

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,529
test first step instrument your

00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,179
workstation to make sure that the

00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,099
venture system that you're using is

00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:57,979
telling the information that you need to

00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,319
know what that means in lengths land is

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,789
that you have SNMP and smtp be installed

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,810
and configured correctly on the

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:08,360
workstation snmpd is the simple

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,749
protocol lets you publish a lot of

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,490
information about your boxes in a

00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:16,639
standard way that we clearly go for

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,210
locally promoter in this case is that I

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,860
workstation I care most about it working

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,080
once its installed depending on your

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:28,249
distribution is either SNMP in SF and

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,779
beer net-snmp something like that once

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:31,219
its installed configured correctly i

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,959
also recommend that you put in a

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:35,180
continuous monitoring service that looks

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,880
at that data and gives you a long term

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,570
chart of what's going on with that those

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,820
network connection historically that

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,670
meant installing either mr to your

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,740
captain Emmert when she is is the

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,500
granddaddy program was released first in

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,600
1995 the version that's available today

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,490
looks a lot the same as it did back then

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,110
which means that its uses

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,579
state-of-the-art effect that column from

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,560
20 years ago he said that it works time

00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:06,760
once you realize what the limitations

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,350
are uses curl a lot to this collection

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,670
it's very limited what it wants to tell

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,279
you it'll just wants to tell you about

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,709
seven alek extended it's kind of hard to

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,390
do and the storage is actually law class

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,170
it's actually txt files for its core

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,459
vault

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,620
and it takes all those files and files

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,389
are all in one directory of such that

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,480
you can look at it with your web browser

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:30,360
and unified nice clean interface

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,309
Episcopal kept eyes more or less a

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,129
response to Mr teach you it is a full

00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:39,389
generation reviewer it uses phc p on the

00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,709
website used MySQL on the back end I can

00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,470
say it doesn't generation your code is

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:45,240
still 15 years old and so there's an

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,910
opportunity I'd love for somebody tell

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,910
me what the new version of these guys is

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,910
that

00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:05,180
those to try observe you could make

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:09,050
paint welcome to repeat that please both

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,149
of these tools are hard to debug running

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,100
the problems but Mr TG has been a bit of

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,100
being simple and so if there's a problem

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,320
so I had not intended for this talk to

00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,660
be a walkthrough on how to install

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,029
services but I had enough trouble as an

00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,610
opp what should events in the process

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,769
that which slacker so the next guy

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,079
doesn't have a problem sighs turns out

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,940
it's really simple this is a diff of my

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,889
configuration file before and after i

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,829
was done you can see down the bottom

00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,660
i've added three lines and lines do two

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:47,750
things one is they define a view into

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,209
S&M your space that includes my network

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,709
information that i don't want to see and

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,139
then after that the phone is a read-only

00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:56,389
and re quite passwords you want to be

00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:58,399
able to access that data remembering

00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,430
that in the SMD world passwords are

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,050
called community variables and the other

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,699
thing to do is to go back and comment

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,790
out any other community variables that

00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:09,949
need getting away very similar once you

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,860
do that restart the system and restart

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:15,410
the service you should be see which one

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,569
I found that that by itself wasn't good

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,120
enough for my purposes it turns out that

00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,769
SNMP by default will take the data that

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,759
it feeds to be a passion for sundry

00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:29,519
3 15 seconds and that value is defined

00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,929
at compile time you can override it

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,480
through that very long command that I

00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,949
have in a diff lock the invective so

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,499
that it's casual in one second this

00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,869
updated continuously but that effect is

00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,790
transient so I took that command and I

00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:45,749
put it into my head file servers from

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,059
every time the service is restarted if

00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:52,079
you want to follow what I did I they

00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:54,149
happen to start in configuration for my

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,949
services at shell scripts makes a lot

00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,929
easier very concise form at all so these

00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,610
things are you create there's a look at

00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:02,279
the bottom of the sea where my SNMP

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,019
configuration it's if you're lucky you

00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,989
can run if you're done if you're not

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:10,639
Lisa provides a very concise set of

00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:10,639
instructions to do get you in one being

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,779
applause over the next two with mr 2g

00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,549
i'll just let you know the installation

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,309
is pretty straightforward this very

00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:21,720
complicated configuration file involved

00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,160
with everything you're monitoring the

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,569
good news is that it can be created

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,860
automatically using a script for

00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:30,240
configuring it runs there are links i

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,309
look at the bottom for a bit walkthrough

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,420
i'll just mention them i found it

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,949
important to pay attention to

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,209
directories that are involved with

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,309
working directory where stuff is

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,470
ultimately store the director numerator

00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:43,020
kutcher configuration file and there's a

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,850
master directory

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,380
what you install this is another thing

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,820
called index finger which alleged if you

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,860
have multiple configurations well

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,860
collection laundry it creates it overall

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,820
once you've done installation mr TG will

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,730
run every five minutes and collect data

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,550
and just be updating out to the other

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,300
time avail before you went i'm going to

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,760
look at cacti for completeness is both

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,470
more complicated and simpler it's more

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,240
complicated because it's integrates with

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:22,830
both your web browser web server and

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,180
your SQL server it's simpler because

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,100
install scripts and available

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,450
walkthroughs to a very good job of

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,400
getting you through that process to

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,740
getting something's working i will just

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,670
mention that be prepared for password

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,470
Nathan's going to do that because

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,690
there's least four counts for five

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,930
accounts that you could do in order to

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,250
set that up with your SQL database your

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,780
captain database you're in one or two

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:48,290
pack time users so I'm down I never

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,370
write down these things

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:54,110
and it's not trivial because of so

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,240
robust and you can you think that it's

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,459
not trivial to create a chart gotta win

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,759
for a walk through airplanes they did a

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:04,329
couple right absolutely why not make

00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,329
your first child

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,560
whichever one who installed when you're

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,910
done I'll end up with something like

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,710
this for every port that you're looking

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,490
at this is for charts looking at the

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:19,120
same corner and i'm looking about daily

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,560
weekly monthly and yearly data and i

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,190
will be able to see their last period

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:31,240
for all time gear back on what kind of

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:32,380
data before now of our workstations

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,080
ready to go it's interesting that a

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:37,030
document i could get data from the next

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,190
step i recommend is to look at your

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,930
network itself and think of some things

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,200
that you can do to make your network

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,090
more testable on a long-term basis I

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,250
have three specific recommendations

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,690
represented here by the icons are one

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:55,090
will call maroon and what it is is do

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,420
something with your router a local data

00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,240
source and our motivational talk about

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,510
those individual first around i highly

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,550
recommend that you have a relic on your

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,070
network an image drug on being able to

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,810
those under your control regardless of

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,610
whatever else rise keep your life and

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,370
that all the data on your network goes

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,080
for that round and the reason is so that

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,270
you can monitor that rather you to see

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,980
all traffic really not going to be able

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,980
to solve problems and so you know which

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,290
either with dry ice tea and then once

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,120
you have that and this your mantras the

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,750
German overall sharktopus your entire

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,820
delegation one thing I'll mention is I

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:44,130
recommend that you buy that router there

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:47,430
are open source firmware monitoring on

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:50,630
your router in my case I found renting

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,750
that process they my problem worst Road

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:56,670
abandoning that in full disclosure I

00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:03,240
don't currently have this because I need

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:07,380
to go out but I am lacking further not

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,900
having that next thing I recommend is

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,780
that you have a data source of some kind

00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,880
that's physically connected to your so

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,430
the travelers represents the demarcation

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,680
between one member and United speak and

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,900
the reason is that as you write tests

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,960
you cannot test that isolate your local

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,210
network from everything else and you can

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,310
very easily discriminate whether a

00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,250
problem is local or remote with just a

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,830
with just a simple second test you

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:40,410
download one works together doesn't not

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:42,630
your own it if you have a network driver

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,460
being a server that's a natural thing to

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:50,820
put on that you can use to download

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:53,220
something and finally it is very

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,370
advantageous to have a flexible remote

00:16:53,220 --> 00:17:01,100
data source I came late to the concept

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:01,100
of the virtual private server service

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,579
but having found that I am totally

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:11,730
totally sold on concept or five to ten

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:16,290
dollars a month you can have a vm that's

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,730
not limited mathlete dress mapping a

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,280
little to service Iranian problems

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:23,220
having your network is available on

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,160
building scale the cost is pennies a day

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,480
if you want to do testing that's

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,760
specific to something you don't have you

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,890
can spin on a server through testing for

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,890
entire day spin it down at the other one

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:40,440
the two names that come up first in this

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,490
list your usual I'm over being emotional

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,760
holding to them versus anybody else

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,140
except your cheek I have active active

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,090
accounts with both of those service than

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:54,010
a very happy bleach the purposes of this

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,440
discussion the most important thing that

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,380
I have on that server is a test file

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,480
indicated by that command bar that has

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,880
random day them as a 10 megabyte file is

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,740
stored in the location brag and access

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:14,350
it over a series of different network

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:16,750
services wife and testicles okay now

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,190
I've got a work station which is

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,900
detestable I've got a network is

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:23,230
detestable last thing is to build test

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,900
bringer that works with those for better

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:28,840
or worse I ended up inventing my own

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,370
tools in order to do this first step is

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,140
I wanted something where I could

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,420
automate the test to the downloads from

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:37,960
different places and I wanted the output

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,900
to be vision or else a second-by-second

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,530
pretty charms and everything works for

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,220
this talk we're muscle works

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:49,290
look at this so first I meant native

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,120
sweet of three small scripts that

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:56,600
conduct that combination on home bangles

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,310
you find out your helper usually and

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,980
this is a very very short tutorial on

00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,560
how to use those tools you see I've done

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,300
to download tests I'm calling those

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,390
tests village are one try to I am

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,320
monitoring the data going into the

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,380
wireless board on my local computer

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,080
during the test I'm checking that day at

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,590
once every 17 and the test itself is a

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:26,730
download google image after our on that

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:28,950
two times I run an ad pwc sv script

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,920
which takes the algorithms to test which

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,030
is a stretch of filing CSV format

00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,660
combines them into a single spreadsheet

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,400
which I'm following in trucks once I run

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,670
that test if I open that in spreadsheet

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,740
program when I say it's guess what I

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,220
have on the left is a single table from

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,900
those two tests it's indexed by time an

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,570
individual columns we just wanted to

00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,520
test by Ram if I take those three

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,550
columns I select them and I said create

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,370
an XY plot of that data I get a chart

00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,790
that looks like that color coded label

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,560
dates times bites brings I found this a

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,970
pretty effective way to use a small

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,780
amount of code to get a very

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,940
philosophers and I used that pretty much

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,360
for all the charts that I'm human all

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,090
pretty today the second tool I ended up

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,020
writing this is a spoiler alert as I was

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,500
doing my analysis a question kept coming

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:28,820
up over and over again what I needed to

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,590
investigate what my overall Network

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:36,919
versus limitations they appear to play

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,570
streams and so I for a while I was

00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,250
splitting files and manage groups and

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,789
things like that I ended up writing a

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,500
team that our serial script that allows

00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,510
me to automate the process of splitting

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,110
file into pieces and transfer over

00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:52,700
multiple SSH streams again a very very

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:57,110
short tutorial this thing's called split

00:20:52,700 --> 00:21:00,830
copying against on we both fit for

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,779
and also a 10-5 install that both

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,149
locally and remotely didn't mention life

00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:08,510
my server that entire concert is names

00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,460
bottle if i install script on both the

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,080
local and remote and then I runs good

00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,899
cop in the Nationals a whole lot like

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,210
our sink I can copy that file on over in

00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,100
this case I'm using dash n file which

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,909
means that I've asked for this copy to

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,950
happen over five parallel t city streets

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:26,450
and when I do that it looks just like

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,269
any of the copy the file shows up

00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:34,370
locally and I can vary their throughout

00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:35,809
sighs whatever okay I got what I need

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,769
done all this work I don't have the

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,789
results yet once again see results I

00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:44,080
wanted to answer a particular question

00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:48,950
why didn't the phones to my cloud server

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:52,490
be so bad this is that clock from the

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,650
first scoffs lie see that section kill

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:57,750
bees per second

00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:00,900
why is that happened well let's do some

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,789
tests to sprinkle to conclusion first

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,470
thing I did was ask well how does that

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,590
download compared with a whole bunch of

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,020
other places on so here's my first test

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,419
I've taken like seven different places

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,960
the random locations on the internet

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:17,400
they all happen to be in the US but

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,929
they're all the new places i'm

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,390
downloading data from each one of them

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,610
just because i don't care about a whole

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,650
lot of data of limited the time timeout

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:29,640
program the first unit and I kill the

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,679
download I take all those CSVs to come

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,020
from all those I combine them together

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,030
in OC the CSB removal out of the debt

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,380
rias that was created by the test and

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:43,380
the result is this this is a typical

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,880
result from that first test what this is

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,309
showing is the download from a bunch of

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,580
the concentra first 5 plus there are

00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:53,190
downloads of a linux installation disk

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:58,110
for five different districts which is

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:59,700
getting a bunch of RL and march and then

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,440
those two skinny ones on the right the

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,480
first one with blue one is a download

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,520
from my cloud serpent and the test file

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,350
that I created earlier and the black one

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,500
is to download the same file from an ass

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,630
which is on the world and I look at this

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,280
and I kind of fool me to conclusions

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,929
without the mini-map tests one is

00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,200
there's something going on at nine

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:22,970
minutes I already know that this network

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,970
is capable 20 plus negative

00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,770
whatever I do anything here free much

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,140
wherever I go at least for this test

00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,540
nine maintenance is the thought it looks

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,130
like a hard one second thing is that

00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,380
autos one just about the melted by yes

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,330
exactly doing a lot better than that

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,960
first clause doing the negative region

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,910
stay on a category third thing I noticed

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,440
is that there are some significant drop

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,960
outs left fedora the yellow in the

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,940
middle that drop out there is more than

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,730
10 seconds there is an extended period

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,070
of time where we have no data whatsoever

00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:59,600
that's perhaps a different obviously

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,460
different problem everything else is

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,140
going on or something needs to be worked

00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,740
at looks like the same thing might be

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,290
happening in our chariot is not the full

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,570
thing is that my local download all not

00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,190
stellar is considerably faster than

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,870
anything else on this clock it's not my

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,510
local network it's not our wireless it's

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:21,440
causing limitation in this case a lot of

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:24,320
information out just one test so I'm

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,630
really curious why these individual TCP

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,400
streams are not doing any better so the

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,520
next thing I did is to do a test that

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,920
isolates the number of TCP streams to

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,500
see how I'm doing in this case all of

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,620
these plots except the last one is a

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,170
download my test file from panel

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,420
also the first three are supposed to be

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,260
exactly equivalent it's an HTTP download

00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,000
an ssh SCP download and then a split

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,570
copy download which should be exactly

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,800
the same as S&P that's a new script and

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,490
you can see in the person in the third

00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,600
case they really are the same ssh and

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,670
HTTP or equivalent I'm not too worried

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,920
about the different tree goes to it the

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:08,590
second one is anomaly that happens in my

00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:11,590
network is something else I look at the

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,510
next three the green and blue are me

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:18,460
running stood collagen parallel streams

00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:21,550
for download to from and they are two

00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,880
screams all screaming screams and indeed

00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,940
as I had more tcp sessions to the

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,340
scoundrel is getting faster curious an

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,340
artifact the fastest one the eight

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,530
streams is faster than my local download

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:41,320
online ass which is not supposed to

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:43,510
happen the only thing I'd say there is

00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,970
this I haven't been real rigorous to

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,770
this point my ass is on wireless and so

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,300
there's two Hobson's all getting over

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,300
suspected that's why it is

00:25:51,480 --> 00:26:00,070
and before I have final results all that

00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:01,840
builders so why give multiple tcp

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,549
streams be faster than single stream

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,009
first thing to say is they shouldn't be

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,019
it should be exactly the same if you

00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:09,549
have an empty pipe which will use some

00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:11,799
site on the internet and you do a

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,019
downward over that pipe it shouldn't

00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:15,129
matter how many strings you have it

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:17,080
should get the same amount of data

00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:20,980
either way from extremely small

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,529
resolution well okay putting that aside

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,600
we are seeing a difference what are the

00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:27,580
reasons why tcp stream the number to

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,769
stream tcp streams which should that

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,409
well here's what I know somebody else do

00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:35,049
some others love to hear it first is

00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,990
congestion is a classic problem if you

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:40,269
have a wall between you and the text on

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:44,019
internet but you will see less than the

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:45,909
total thing you will not typically see

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,309
that hard limit that I'm seeing in my

00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:50,610
downloads it typically be more variable

00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:54,249
than that just less than what you told

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:56,259
it could be a concept called window and

00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:59,159
TCP there's a limit to the number of

00:26:56,259 --> 00:27:01,720
packets that will allow me in flight

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,519
confirmation of an older one back and

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,889
because of that there's a hard limit

00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,690
which is equal to that number of packets

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:10,590
times the size of a pack of times the

00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:14,520
round-trip time that is a fundamental

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:21,150
fashion get danger TCP TCP is like Lucas

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:23,279
on the house it's never a jacket is here

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,980
for a reason that I get to shorten

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,870
others a ramp up time on TCP when you

00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,250
forced our stream to start slowly and

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,230
speeds up and so you have multiple

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,710
screens the net speed up process is

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:36,120
going to be linearly faster effect for

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,669
the size of the file i'm doing here is

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,870
negligible it's not ramped up i'll just

00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:45,179
put that area completely another choice

00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,610
is traffic shakers somebody between me

00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,679
and my cloud service is doing something

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,809
to manage the amount of data that's on

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,309
the network and as a result by

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:57,120
individual streams we're not getting as

00:27:53,309 --> 00:28:00,360
much data as network should begin that

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,919
sounds like a very likely candidate and

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,669
again there's anything else I work for

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,669
somebody tell me what

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,399
no I have things you're talking about

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:48,040
and again in that context I'm not trying

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,870
to solve a problem on workstation trying

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,640
to solve a problem or right for my

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,940
clouds are trying to sell the problem

00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,440
for me network and a solution like that

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,750
and it turns out that's the solution I

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,710
got a problem because I have to put all

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,710
kinds of different place

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:59,040
I really don't want to be when doing

00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,170
because again Linda wings would probably

00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,650
have to solve the source side solving it

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,480
on my consort ourselves one computer but

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,370
I looked at it and one thing I had told

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,070
was otto was not in the United States I

00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,880
was in the Amsterdam i put my serve in

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,880
amsterdam because

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:20,620
