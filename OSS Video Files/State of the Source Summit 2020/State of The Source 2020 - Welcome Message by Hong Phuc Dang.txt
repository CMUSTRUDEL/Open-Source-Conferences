	Welcome to the State of the Source Summit 2020!

The State of the Source Summit invites open source communities of practice from around the world to organize and contribute to a global conversation on the current state of open source software: non-technical issues that foster development and community, the licenses that enable collaboration, the practices that promote contribution, and the issues confronting cooperation.

State of the Source is an innovative program that follows the sun around the globe with regional projects, and communities in every timezone creating and delivering content relative to local open source issues and interests, while engaging with an international audience of peers.
