Description: 
	Does Open Source Need its own Priority of Constituencies
Tobie Langel

What do you do when the interest of your different constituencies are in conflict? Who do you favor and why? The 4 Freedoms and the (OSD) were designed for a small community of hobbyists. They offer little help when it comes to addressing the challenges open source faces today. Does open source need a W3C-inspired "priority of constituencies?" In this talk we’ll dig into the priority of constituencies, see how it could apply to open source, and get some interesting insights out of doings so.
