Description: 
	What can analyzing tens of terabytes of public trace data tell us about open source sustainability?
Bogdan Vasilescu and Christian Kaestner

Open-source communities face significant sustainability challenges, from attracting and retaining a diverse set of contributors, to fundraising. Through interviews, surveys, and analysis of billions of commits and other public traces, we studied the organization, functioning, and overall health of open-source communities. Among others, we found that donations are not promising for the vast majority of maintainers and that team demographic diversity correlates with higher productivity.
