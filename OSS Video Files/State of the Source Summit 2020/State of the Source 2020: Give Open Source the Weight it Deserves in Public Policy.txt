Description: 
	Give Open Source the Weight it Deserves in Public Policy
Paula Grzegorzewska and Sivan Pätsch

When the last study on Open Source in Europe was concluded in 2006, Open Source had not yet taken over the world. Yet policymakers don’t have the data they need to treat Open Source as the innovation machine it has become. Fraunhofer and OpenForum Europe have been tasked by the European Commission to research the value of Open Source Software and Hardware. During this presentation we will share preliminary takeaways and tell you why we need your input to make a pro-open source policy a reality.

welcome to everybody listening in we are very excited to have you here to

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,480
talk about something that we think is sometimes an under

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,640
emphasized area of open source which is the government's involvement in

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
it first the introductions my name is Sivan Pätsch i'm openforum

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,880
europe's research director and i am paula grzegorzewska policy analyst

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
at OFE we are a brussels-based think tank that

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
is committed to advancing openness in digital

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
policy so why do we say in the title give open source the weight and policy

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,399
that it deserves i think here in this room everybody

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
knows that open source is absolutely ubiquitous in tech

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,680
what company working with code today isn't using open source software

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,840
nobody would start a software project in 2020 without using open source software

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
components so for us here it's very clear that open

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
source saves a lot of development time it enables innovative projects and it

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,879
provides equal access but the truth is also that open source

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,280
is a niche what i'm saying is ask yourself has your

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
mother ever heard about open source or your siblings and crucially does your

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
local representative your politician know does your typical

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,439
policy maker know what open source is clearly in almost all cases the answer

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,840
to this is no they know about labour policy they maybe

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,320
today even know about data protection but they don't know about open source

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
and what we see here in brussels is that even those

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,759
who write digital legislation rarely know what open source is

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,680
and so we wondered what do we have to do what do we have to show for after many

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,280
years of adequacy toward lawmakers around the world

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
and this is also something we ask ourselves regarding our work

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,159
and we're currently doing research into this and the answer seems to be

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,560
not that much what we do have is a number of laws or norms

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
favoring open source in public procurement

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
meaning the government says that when they buy software they will buy

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,959
open source if it is of similar quality and availability

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
this seems like it might be one thing connecting open source and public

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,920
policy around the world this is also the one that seems easiest to understand and

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,239
implement for policy makers you can implement it with a few people believing

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,720
in open source who can influence public policy

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,319
around and a lot of countries have tried their hands in this

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,720
with though admittedly maybe mixed results

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
seeing outside of public procurement we don't have a lot

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
this differs a bit between countries of course again

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
having surveyed this very broadly speaking it seems that governments

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,879
in western countries such as united states latin america and europe

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
they approach open source purely from a public procurement perspective

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
hoping that there might be also some indirect favorable effects from that

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,599
and on the other hand we see governments in countries in asia

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,800
that also do some work in getting their industry hooked up with open source

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
software to support digitalization but we were

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
wondering isn't there more potential in open

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
source than just saying it will save us x percentage of development costs

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
in terms of the government what do you think i think we can talk about this a

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,239
little bit more in the q a section in 10 minutes but

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
just as an exercise now for us we thought about a few policy fields

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
that digital policy makers engage with on a daily basis that we see here in

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
brussels day-to-day and it really isn't difficult

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,200
at all to see what open source can do in those fields

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
so if we think about open source and cyber security

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,040
and then you can immediately see you have auditability of code that increases

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,599
trust if you look at open source and research

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
innovation you see making innovation more open

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
increasing access if you look at open source and machine learning

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
making automated decisions more transparent as a positive

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
if you look at open source in high performance computing

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,720
breaking existing login effects of dominant suppliers

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
and then if you look at open source and telecommunications you can have

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,760
interoperability on all levels of the stack

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
and if you look at copyright well those who know article 13

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,680
and that is a term to them maybe we should better not talk about this

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
um but i'm going to be really cheeky and i'm going to say that

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,840
no policymaker in the world working on the latest cyber security legislation

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,880
has ever included a paragraph on open source software

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,639
or even hardware and so why is that we think that is because they don't know

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,479
the role of open source today they don't know that open source already

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,120
plays a huge role in all of these areas they don't know how

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
important it actually is in a digital space whenever we talk to policy makers

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,199
about open source very few will know that open source is

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,919
about and those that have heard about it will often have huge misconceptions

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,800
about it they don't know that the i.t energy

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
industry today is built on open source that all of these jobs are connected

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
to it and that huge communities exist around it

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,520
and that it is big business as well as a big idea

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,720
so that's we're trying to where we're trying to come in and so i hand over to

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
paula now

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,360
so the question might be why do policy makers don't know much about open source

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,080
a big part of the answer is that there is a lack of cross-sectoral research on

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
the issue and subjectively noticed by us decrease

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
in a number of those who research promote and explain open source both to

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
policy makers but also to other people but also global and structured and by

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,160
nature-free character of open source does not make it easier here

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,080
in order to develop and implement policies in a given area policy makers

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
need evidence they need a number of jobs that

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
can be created innovation indicators company standard

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
turnover possible economic growth and all other numbers

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,560
we do have quite some research on open source but very often it is not easy to

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,240
use it in a policy making environment there are some organizations highly

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
involved in researching open source and countries that gave open source

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,039
quite a big spot in the digital policy agenda

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
so in recent years we've seen for example the open source monitor

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,440
from 2019 by the digital companies association bitkom in germany

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
which is a report on the use of open source software in the german economy

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,520
including a survey of over 800 companies another interesting case is france where

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,120
we have the the association cnll a french national

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
council for open source software and this report includes a survey and

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
quantitative data on the situation of open source companies and development in

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,440
france focusing on the digital transformation

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,880
and innovation driven by open source and another interesting study is is a

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
study by our collaborator a harvard professor frank nago

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,160
that has done an interesting research on the impact of changing procurement law

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
in france this law requires government agencies to

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
favor open source software over proprietary software in an attempt to

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,800
reduce costs what is interesting is that he found out

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,599
that the policy change led to an increase of nearly 600 000 oss

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,440
contributions per year from france an increase in number of companies that

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,400
use open source and an increased number of jobs

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,080
while bringing benefits such as higher competitiveness of the country's digital

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
sector both domestically and abroad these are

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,520
some of the largest pieces of research that have been done in recent years on

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,440
the impact that open source software has in european countries

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,280
but what about europe

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,479
the answer is that the last research was done in 2006.

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
it was a study on the economic impact of open source software on innovation and

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,560
competitiveness procured by the european commission and

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
it did find out that there is a great potential lying in open source for

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
european digitization but of course the reality in 2020 is

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
totally different than it was almost 15 years ago

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,120
let's remember the european commission is one of the few institutions that

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
could procure such a study that takes a look at the whole eu and

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
aims to capture the nature of open source while taking into

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,120
consideration so many countries the european commission seems to notice

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,479
the potential of open source for the welfare of its citizens

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,639
competitiveness of its companies and transparency and speed of digitization

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
efforts it just needs evidence to do so

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
including understanding if it is indeed such an important and possibly

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,560
beneficial tool for the whole union so having said that we were very glad to

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,160
hear that the european commission issued a call for tender to conduct a

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
pan-european study on the impact of open source

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,200
open source has been maturing for quite some time now and we think that this is

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
the time to provide the evidence needless to say we at oafe have been

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,480
pondering the idea of a european study on open source for

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
quite some time now and pushing for it quite a bit as well

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,360
the european commission has already made it clear in 2016 with its communication

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,760
on ict standardization priorities for the digital single market

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
that it intends to promote the use of open source elements in cloud standards

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
it's aimed at promoting the interoperability and portability of the

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
cloud and procuring this study shows that the

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,920
commission is committed to collaborate with stakeholders and open source

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
communities and plans to include open source in its

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
future digital policies which of course makes us very happy just

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
like the fact that we got the opportunity to conduct this study

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
together with the research institute fraunhofer isi

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
even more we we are analyzing both open source software

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
and hardware which is quite particular maybe some

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,480
of you know but there is virtually no policies on open source hardware

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
and very few who studied the subject from policy perspective

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,640
so we are very excited to do this work and how are we going to do this first

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,880
we conduct the economic impact analysis of open source which of course is much

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,920
easier with software than hardware second we research digital policies that

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,519
relate to open source and actual open source policies in european

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,279
countries but also in a couple of other countries that might provide some

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,440
lessons for us and those include the us china south

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
korea india japan and brazil these two areas

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,680
of research will allow us for at least a partial estimation of the impact that

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,920
open source has on the european economy but also to develop sound policy

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,399
recommendations based on the factual state of open source

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
of course a big challenge here is obtaining and accumulating the needed

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,560
data let's remember that research for policy making is quite different than

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,560
academic or technical research on top of that we conduct case studies

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
that focus on different technological areas such as ai high performance

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
computing and cyber security and throughout the various industrial

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
domains so for example manufacturing logistics and health

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,120
but what i think might be interesting to you we would like you to get involved

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,959
we had already mentioned this on quite some conferences when those in real life

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,120
were still allowed we are conducting a big survey of open

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
source companies projects and organizations we developed

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
the survey with the name of capturing the real face

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,120
of open source within companies both small one-person ventures and among

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,560
tech giants what is important to know we don't want

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,200
to survey only open source companies open source encompasses much more than

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
open source companies we talk here about using open source

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,959
frameworks in large companies developing proprietary products

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,079
but we also talk here about the use of open source hardware

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,680
in both local maker maker maker spaces in your

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,839
in your small towns and in cheap design among huge companies

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
the data that we gather within the survey includes

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,279
some numbers of course we need that on the usage of open source within

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
companies what kind of companies and organizations

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,560
are using or contributing to open source what is the open source related turnover

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,279
but also employment related to open source innovation indicators

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
is it actually true for all companies that open source can increase their

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,279
innovative innovativeness subjective and

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,839
quantified benefits of open source does it make some developers happy to work on

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
an open source project in their job does it actually matter or maybe it's

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,800
still more about the cost saving possibilities

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
these are just some of the questions that we search and answer for

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,760
so we would highly appreciate you participating in the survey

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,959
if you would like to get notified when the survey is open

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
please click the link that we see here it's a special list

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,120
just for this purpose so don't worry we won't be sending you newsletters every

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,839
week or using your data for any other purposes

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,760
um and these were some issues that we are trying to research

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,040
but of course we have some more questions and we are curious what you

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
think about some some of other issues such as

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
do we even need more open source in public policy

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,800
is it actually needed another one is what role can open source play in the

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,040
age of regulation because we see that the digital space is

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,880
growing we see that there is also more regulation following

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
it but is there a special place for open source in there

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,040
and the third question is what are the benefits and opportunities that

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,279
governments can see in supporting open source these are the

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,760
questions that we would like to leave to you

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,399
uh to wonder about and maybe we can talk about it during the q&a session

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,160
and with these questions in mind we thank you for staying with us

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,600
during this presentation if you would like to contact us

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,079
feel free to write at euteam at openforumeurope dot org

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
reminder if you would like to join the project and get involved in providing

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,480
data for the future of open source policy making

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,959
just contact us thank you thank you fantastic okay so that's why that's

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
where we do the test for osi does a pre uh with a test session with

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,040
us to check it all out and then it takes a minute to get it right during

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,920
the actual um actual talk anyway uh well but thanks

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
for first for uh all the active um

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,519
participation already in the chat and the question

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
paula if you could click on the shared notes just so i can read the questions

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
and maybe then we'll just try to kind of go

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
through a few of the questions that we have in the shared notes and if you want

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
to add something just go ahead and then we also go

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
through that um the first one is a good one uh i'm not

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
gonna say i'm not gonna pretend like we have the answer to this

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,360
this is probably something that we all have to discuss and also

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
within the study that we're doing we are primarily focused on the national level

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,959
so it wasn't 100 the focus um of or isn't 100

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,480
the focus is that we're doing yet i think maybe um

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
something that that we've seen uh in the context of

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,000
the municipal level and trying to figure out a little bit um

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,320
uh what the role there is and you know what people on the on the city level or

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,880
maybe municipal level can do um an example here maybe is germany okay

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,839
i'm german so i know a little bit more about that but

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
um in germany the national government is very inactive when it comes to open

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
source you know i i said in the presentation a lot of governments

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,639
have public procurement laws and germany doesn't even have that

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,759
but on the municipal and regional level there's much

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,600
more and i think that also plays an important role in letting the national

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
government know what opportunities are there for example

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,959
data port which is the regional provider regional IT

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,120
provider in the north in germany for the for the regions they are doing a great

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
project called phoenix where they're trying to create

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
an open source online desktop you know next cloud libreoffice online you name

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
it online offices i think actually and this is something that i

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,279
think the national level can really learn from

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,600
um and you know i'm governments they have hundreds of thousands of desktops

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,160
people working on them um and there's a lot of opportunity there

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
that go further than also just the desktop even though of course we all

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
know even in governments when we go further in the desktop

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,279
open source is already they're quite ubiquitous

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
i hope that kind of answers the question but maybe there's also discussion

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
possibility here i don't know let's take a look let's take it okay we're taking a

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,880
look at the chat yes munich although of course that is a

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,079
bit of a a story riddled with issues um probably

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,519
uh expectations in munich were um a bit difficult and then also political

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
issues um but maybe let's not go too much in

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
detail maybe let's go to the next one just to keep keeping things flowing a

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
little bit so the second question research is of not

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,720
usable right yeah this is a great question uh loving this

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
question because of course this is for us

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,799
a great opportunity to talk about what we do actually in brussels

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,640
which is a lot working with researchers trying to get

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,200
um trying to get knowledge um and research to policymakers so

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
i think paula is going to probably put something in the she's working on right

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,760
now he's going to put a link um to um open

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,320
forum academy which is a scholastic program that we

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,240
run um with a number of researchers but also

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,880
practical practitioners where we work with them

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
to bring them to brussels we organize events relatively regularly

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,600
not right now of course although we're trying to get them started again

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,520
to really um to really get uh policymakers and we have i think a good

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,880
network in brussels with all the digital policy people here

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,480
um to to to really surface that kind of knowledge

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
um if you would like uh um to if you're interested in these activities

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,840
uh also just email us at eu team uh dot at open eu team at openfront

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,919
europe.org uh you saw the email address in the

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,039
presentation project power would also put it in the chat

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,559
um um and you know we're always really really happy

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,160
to have additional people in uh in this initiative

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
and i think uh it's really great because this is essentially one of the things

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
that uh is the most maybe rewarding work

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
almost that we can do is to really bring uh knowledge to

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
policy makers but i would also add that uh i think

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,559
it's a general problem you know like it's not a problem that is

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,880
specific to open source in any way and i think that many policy makers are

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,600
actually searching for the contact with the researchers

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,600
so i think there is quite a big feel to get engaged in that and especially for

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,600
some independent organizations that could work as a sort of intermediary

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
between the researchers and policymakers yeah that's

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
that's a really great point because i think

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
we're just kind of expanding on that policy makers often

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,559
they are um they're faced with the issue that they need to write something they

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,440
need to write either of something for a higher up or they need to actually write

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
a law and then they try to figure out okay so

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
what should we actually do and so they're really

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,520
they really need the input uh and they are they're trying to get it

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,960
from all sides and if you're not in brussels uh it will be

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,160
it's very difficult to kind of get this knowledge to them and so

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
this is one of the things that we try to do um yeah so just again

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
if you're if you're interested in this kind of more policy work um

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,960
just get in touch and let's talk do you want to

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,240
take the next one i mean let's start let's say okay

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,440
uh do you know of corresponding institutions outside of europe doing

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,919
similar research into open source policy making for their respective areas

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
i haven't encountered that much research focused on policies

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,600
uh there was like we sort of called it the first wave of

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:13,200
open source which was still two thousand twelve yeah and there was this big big

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
report on different open source policies around the world i think the like the

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
latest edition is from 2010 it was some professor from the us

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
yeah the center for now the name escapes me but they did this report

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,520
a few other organizations but i think they also dropped out of the kind of

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,480
open source topic it's quite interesting this is something maybe we don't have

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
time to to go into detail right now but this is

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,720
quite interesting the way open source yeah i think we call

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
it waves it's a bit of a difficult term right now

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,200
but okay um the first wave as we we kind of call it

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
a bit um from the early 2000s to maybe 2012 where

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
it was very um activist driven very much driven from

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,440
the community side um and then for different reasons

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
it died down a little bit in terms of the public side

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,200
the public sector side the government side and then of course open source

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
already toward the end of that phase became so ubiquitous within the private

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,159
sector within companies that now in this we call the second wave

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,760
in recent years um the kind of perspective that people are bringing

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,400
toward governments it's a quite different perspective and

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,360
it's more from the corporate side and in some sense more um yeah it's more

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
public and more from this perspective so it's quite

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,320
interesting um i'm not sure yeah i have to be honest

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,679
i'm not sure if anybody else is sort of doing similar work in other areas but if

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,440
you know somebody please let us know because there's a lot

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,799
of initiatives that are more focused on like actually the usage

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,559
and development but not only the policies yeah that's true sort of a lot

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
of the studies and research has been very much

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,559
on the on the more corporate side and of course we're looking also

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,000
specifically on the public public a public policy side

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
okay next question uh are you concerned about the big tech's embrace of open

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
source is there a risk of open source becoming

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,679
enclosed in cloud environments well that's a great question i don't

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,240
know if this is quite in scope for our uh

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,720
for our topic because we really focus on on public policy

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,799
um maybe i think maybe it's a little bit out of scope but maybe the only thing i

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,440
can say from based on our research is quite

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,840
interesting that most of the procurement laws around the world i want to

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,039
say something maybe 60 70 percent do reference either the osi open source

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,000
definition or the fsf's free software definition

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,240
um and from that perspective um uh yeah quite quite clearly um um

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,840
uh going for this although of course you know well

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,799
those that uh do um uh close uh closed uh source um or closed um

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,080
cloud services sometimes based on open source

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,880
um probably are still um not like in violation of those

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,440
licenses okay big topic maybe not quite for now

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
