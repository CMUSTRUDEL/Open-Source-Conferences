Description: 
	Give Open Source the Weight it Deserves in Public Policy
Paula Grzegorzewska and Sivan Pätsch

When the last study on Open Source in Europe was concluded in 2006, Open Source had not yet taken over the world. Yet policymakers don’t have the data they need to treat Open Source as the innovation machine it has become. Fraunhofer and OpenForum Europe have been tasked by the European Commission to research the value of Open Source Software and Hardware. During this presentation we will share preliminary takeaways and tell you why we need your input to make a pro-open source policy a reality.
