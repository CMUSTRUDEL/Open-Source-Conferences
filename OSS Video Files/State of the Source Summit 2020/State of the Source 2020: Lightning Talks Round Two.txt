well welcome everybody to our second round of

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,400
lightning talks and let's go ahead and dive right into

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,800
it our first presenter is

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,560
kevin and his speech is how to measure open source score kevin

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
so so today's topic is uh how to measure open source score

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,440
right fine so i think uh there is a one thing in common between you all and me

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,200
right that we all are uh you know interested about

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,120
open source as a philosophy right and that's why we are here so welcome all

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
and let me start my talk so uh before that so these are the

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
agenda on which i will discuss in this five minute okay

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,559
so the first thing i would like to share with all of you is

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,640
uh you know my first android mobile in 2010

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
right this is like samsung galaxy y so when i

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
i'm about to purchase this phone so at the time i am not aware about coding and

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,640
all the stuff but one of my friend told me that you

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
know android is something open source

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
operating system and what do you mean by open source when i asked them

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,799
so he's he told me that you know open source is something

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,960
where you can write your code and you can also publish your application

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
right if you want to change anything in this operating system

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
you are free to do that right so at that time i am not much aware about coding

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
not today also but i like that idea that you know as

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
i as an individual who can make the change in the code

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
right so that was the fascinating idea to me and that's why i purchased this

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
phone and my first smartphone okay

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,920
and uh yeah now let's talk about favorite food

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
right so just i want to connect this open source philosophy with uh

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
it's a food right so i'm from gujarat india

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,520
so here the food called pani puri is very famous and i like it very much

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,880
so just i would like to tell you that you know the one thing is buy

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
right so suppose i am going to the shop i will buy panipuri i will eat and

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,599
enjoy right the second case is make right now if you think that i want to

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
make it right so again you can search on youtube the recipe and try to make it

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
home right but there is some difference in

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
the taste right because i am making the first time right

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
and with some abc panipuri which is very famous

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,080
or any brand is there right so there is a difference in taste right there is

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,280
something usb they have as the taste and raw material

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
which i cannot make at the first time right

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,480
and the third so when i see open source i can also see like

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,120
you know there are some commercial software there are some open source

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,319
software right commercial software you can pay them

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,920
amount and you can uh you know purchase the right and you can use it

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,800
right uh but you cannot modify it right so uh here in open source there is a

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
liberty to modify also right and there is something called sell

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,560
also so you can sell under your name also

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
right so suppose there is some abc panipuri is there right

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,319
suppose he thought that you know let us make this recipe as an open source

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,440
so that everyone can you know modify the recipe

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
and give their name to the brand and they can sell so same way

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
in open source also right the code is open

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
anyone are free to do modification and also they can

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
resell this uh product in their name right so this way we all grow in open

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,519
source right so now accidentally core

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
contributor at wordpress.org so before two year only i

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,879
you know thought to let's develop a website so i researched and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,239
you know then i end up with that okay wordpress is something a software

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,200
well uh one can create a website for i mean the code is free and open source

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,720
right so when i go deeper and started you know small

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
contribution in that so i can we can see that there are

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
different 10 types of contribution type right so that this way

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,159
a wordpress is recognized that you know the people who are making changes

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,920
or basically contributing so uh one day i am you know making my website

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,720
and i find some bug right i'm not a developer i'm not a

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,439
technical person but i find mine in a bug

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,560
so what i done is i take a screenshot right

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,639
and on github i just paste on particular wordpress page that hey i'm

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
working on this and i find this bug okay so after some time the people who are

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
actually the core developer they see and they check

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
yes that is actually a bug so they try work on that and in next version

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,320
they have improved that bug right and uh now

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,199
as a as a i'm not i'm not actually testing this wordpress but i'm using it

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,880
and i find this bug accidentally right and when i report them so according to

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
them i uh nothing but a core contributor so in the next version they you know

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,120
highlight give me the credit as a core contributor

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
and give me this badge so in a way it feel good right when we get some badge

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
or some get recognition it feel good so uh on this idea if you

00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
go ahead uh there is something called translation

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
contributor right so in the world there are so many different

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
languages right one language is not enough to communicate all the world

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
so that's why this code is also translating in different languages right

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,680
so suppose someone is not a coder or technical person like me

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,080
you at least can you know contribute as a translation contributor you can

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
translate the you know whole website or code in your mother language

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,080
right so this is something translation contributor which everyone can do that

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,880
right and uh this is my last slide right and so there are so many ways to

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,160
measure this open source score so one of the ways

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
right so what we can do is uh let's say let's talk about this a

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
wordpress.org first right so uh suppose uh out of time we

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,199
can give this code okay if someone has

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
contributed in so many areas five six seven eight

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,800
based on that we can here the basic score is eight right same

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
way there is something called vlc media player

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
mozilla firefox the browser ubuntu the operating system

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
and library office the you know office platform

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
so uh based on our contribution right we can uh

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
an agency can rate the score right now suppose i am only

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,720
uh involving this five different open source project right

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,639
so i will do this total which is 30 and i will take an average

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,840
30 divided by which is six right so here i

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,400
will end up as an uh score which is 5.6 now how to read this 5.6 hey here five

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,440
means uh which is this how many a project you

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
are contributing so five means i am contributing to five different

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
projects right and point six is nothing but average

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,319
right that i am at which level so this is i think one of the way where we can

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
you know measure this open source score and this way actually we can

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,440
motivate all the people or the student all the newbies

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
right to you know go ahead with that and start contributing

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
so that they can improve that open source score and

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,039
yeah so i think this is my from my side right so

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,800
now uh any question or any suggestion or how we can you know

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
better measure this open source score so yeah please

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,759
next up we have jose lopez with open source program office to help

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,199
and hope on to help on open source sustainability

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
hey good morning good afternoon good evening depending on when you are

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,759
looking at this conference and we are going to start talking about

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
open source program offices how they are an important role for

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,520
open source sustainability um thank you very much for the organization to let me

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
participate in this lighting talk it's just five minutes so let's go for it and

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
let's start by talking about ospos open source profits

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,160
i don't know how many of you know about it but

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,319
a quick introduction to the concept is basically in an organization

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
private non-profit whatever there are a strong relationship with open source

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
software nowadays either because they consume open source software

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
because they are hiring companies providing services or they are using

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,240
software internally to build their own technology whatever

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
that's what i call inbound processes but there are also outbound processes

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
and they are becoming more and more important

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
like contributing to existing open source projects contributing upstream

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
or even companies and organizations releasing their own open source projects

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,520
and basically the osprey is the ones

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
managing all all these things all these workflows happening

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
in an organization and i i like to call them the

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,759
rangers in the organization's open source ecosystem first of all because

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,440
this idea of there is an ecosystem of my organization

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
around open source that i depend on it basically i depend

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,599
on the health of that ecosystem my technology my teams my

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,279
contributions are going to be important and going to be it has an

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
impact and there are several areas of knowledge

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,839
that need need to be taken into account to manage

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
first of all legal related with ip licensing and all the stuff

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
usually that lawyers are worried about companies being sued

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
but also things related with people like how i can attract talent for this open

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
source place to my organization how i can retain talent allowing my

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
people to contribute to open source projects so even things like that

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,279
are very important and last but not least

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,200
engineering from the engineering point of view if any technology is important

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,360
nowadays that we are working living in a software

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
world is basically any important on the software

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
of of my team or my organization it has an impact on engineering so i need to

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
take care of all of that so basically it's a lot of different stuff

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,920
but coming back to the topic i would like to highlight today is this a

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,519
balance between consumers contributors and maintainers this

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
is discussions happening about okay there is no balance and it's hard to

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
keep the balance of organizations that are taking open

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,399
source and not contributing back and i think that that's that's important

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,600
because from my experience consuming and even

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,880
contributing open source software without care like okay let's let's use

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
this software and it's open so i can use it for free or

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,959
let's release this open source software

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,120
without taking care about any vulnerabilities or licensing problems or

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
things even worse like that it's very risky and

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
i think ospo and the people working in ospo has

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
all the knowledge and the capability and the tools

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
to manage all of this in a in a proper way and i will say that

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
the the goal one of the main goals for any ospo

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,480
should be like okay let's ensure the security of

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
of the ecosystem the open source ecosystem around our organization

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,519
and it's basically follow the path of okay let's try

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
to move users to contributors contributors to maintainers

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,040
in the sense of okay let's create this culture of we are part of the ecosystem

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,360
and we should be taking care of taking care of this ecosystem to to

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
sustain to survive so and of course a lot of

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,920
people are talking about funds and giving funds to projects and stuff like

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
that i i would like to highlight one thing

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
among all the options that are on there that hiring and the small companies that

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
are providing consulting customization even

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
individuals that are providing services around the open source points they

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,079
maintain is one option and companies should be

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,959
moved to that and i think that's very important and i would like

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,000
to highlight the not invented here syndrome that many companies

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
like oh we can do that we don't need to hire anyone we can use this server by

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
ourselves please avoid that and go and hire all

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,760
these people and that will be that would be my

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
remarks for this lighting talk is basically

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
ospo managed to accomplish and diverse relationship with different

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
open source projects and this idea of open source ecosystem and you need

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
this figure or this this organization inside your company

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
you should be taking care of your open source ecosystem because your

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
sustainability and growth as an organization

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,959
may depend on it and of course open source and code are not the limited

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,079
resource here basically the limited resources are the people maintaining

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,160
this this code hiring is an option avoid not invented here syndrome and i would

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,639
say that that would be all from my side i would like to highlight that we have a

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,560
mea session later today so please join us

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,560
the link is there and that would be it from my side thank you very much

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,760
thank you so much our next presenter is panos

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,040
with code software choose the license wisely

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
my name is panos kalorogiannis and my talk will focus on how to choose the perfect

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,160
open source license for your software let's move on every day

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,079
a big number of software are developed either to meet a need that does not

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
exist or for a new idea that will bring major

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,760
changes in science and technology in any case

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
software cannot be used by user other than the author

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,120
without a software license in essence the license is what gives the user the

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,399
right to use the software under other circumstances the user would

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
be using it illegally

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,320
the two major types of open source software licenses are copyleft and

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
permissive it is emphasized that both types are

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,000
considered open source and at the same time offer

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,200
every right to the user for freedom of use without any restrictions

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,639
let's see what each type of license is for

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
copyleft licenses are those where the user can use

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
edit and redistribute the software freely

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,519
but providing the software software code with the same license this in turn means

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
that once the software is subject to the

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
copyleft license it will not be possible to make any

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,639
changes to a permissive license some valuable examples are no

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,199
new general public license and mozilla license

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,560
permissive license are those that when used in software

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,880
the user can also use edit and redistribute the software

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,079
but in this case it is not now necessary to provide the same license

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,040
in short after the distribution the software license may change

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,920
some examples are the bsd license mit and apache another issue

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
that should be addressed by the person developing the software is this

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,160
is the silent license going to be changed

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,519
from permissive to copyleft and vice versa if so

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,240
then it is very important that we understand the compatibility between

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,839
software licenses as far as permissive licenses are concerned

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,560
they can be converted to copyleft but not the other way around

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,480
the reason as we mentioned above is because in copyleft licenses

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
the license should remain as it is

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
here is a license usage chart we can clearly see

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,399
that the most used open source license is mit

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,320
and this is due to github projects

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,240
before we're asked to decide what type of license and

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
which one fits our software it would be a good idea to give some business

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,399
answers to the following questions what are the

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,560
goals of the software is the development software intended for

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,639
a company for a research purpose or of a service

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,720
or to assist the research conducted at the university

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,000
a worldwide example is the following if the software

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,399
is intended for research conducted in a university

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
then it would be a very good idea for the license

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,519
to be copyleft so that the code can be accessed

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,759
anytime how many technologies does it combine and what license

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
do these technologies use for this question

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
we should consider whether the software is a project from scratch

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,519
or somewhat that uses libraries from other groups of developers

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
since we have answered the above questions it is very

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
likely that we have come up with a license that suits us best

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,839
however it is not excluded that the appropriate one

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
has not been found in this case the multi-licensing

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,519
licensing option is given during multi-licensing

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,880
we may use one or more licenses for our software

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
of course in order to be vertically and practically feasible

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,880
it will be good for our software to be from scratch

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,440
so that there is no licensed library incompatible with ours

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
an example is the following by creating a software

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,519
we can divide it into two versions the community and the premium one

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,759
undoubtedly premium will provide more technologies however

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,240
it will use a closed license while the community one

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,880
will be available to the public with an open source license

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,839
that was the end of the presentation thank you very much

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,000
thank you so much up next we have sodipo

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
with designer design from the dimensions of open

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
source so yeah i'm sorry about the breach um hi everyone i'm going to be

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,240
speaking today about design fundraiser open source

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,880
and so yeah um open source is new source sent by a friend at diwali apache

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,200
let's move forward so uh i do open source my name is Shodipo Ayomide i

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
develop open source contribution on github and

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
creating projects out there i am senior developer advocates from lagos nigeria

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
i do a whole lot of community work around africa also on unstack africa

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
open source community africa developers circles lagos on facebook africa hacks and

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,960
other communities out there so yeah let's go cooking

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
so designs can't get less creative um the more you produce design assets the more

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
creative you get over time so experience is what exactly

00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,919
makes a great designer being able to contribute open source all

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,280
the time it's what makes um experienced contributors on open source so i can say i

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,160
come to contribute open source because i have contributed to open source

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,679
over time over time over time and that's the experience so i can teach other

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
people how to contribute open source as a designer but then there are some

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
limitations let's talk about that right now so these

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
are the problems now this is some of the problems so it's

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,440
quite hard to find a single designer who can

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,559
contribute to open source efficiently um perceptions of design is not needed in

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
open source but just make it work so a lot of people say okay just just make it

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
work no one really cares uh a whole bunch of things so what

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,080
just make it work that's what everyone really cares about and yeah

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,320
so that's wrong and that shouldn't be it yeah

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,799
yeah so to the solution spot um yeah so this is a solution spot so resources

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,320
tailored towards how to contribute to open source as a designer

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
um over the internet we have a lot of resource resources on how developers can

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
contribute themselves to open source we have all of that out

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,720
there but we have a few resources to help

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,080
designers contribute to open source so yeah thanks to organizations like um the

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
open source design open source initiative and other

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
um related organizations trying to put together resources together to help

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,760
designers contribute open source so let's do a little bit of getting

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,679
started with open source so um this is my personal definition of

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
open source and i'd love to go with this every time so open source in a nutshell is a

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,000
free software built by the community for the community

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,120
with improvements shared across different technical talents in the

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
community so this is basically open source is to me

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
and yeah across developers designers and everyone

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
so the web has been open source since the view page source so

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,280
since um chrome uh added a view page source um and inspect element feature to chrome

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,760
browser it has an open source consent because on

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,320
any website we can just right click we can just like tap twice

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,280
and we can see the veiw page source and we can see the source code of the website and

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,480
we can detect what exactly is wrong somewhere we can see the css if we

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,039
inspect the elements and we can know what exactly to change

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,440
if we understand css as a designer so yeah so this is just some of the

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,480
crappy things that a lot of these engineers say about designers that are

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
really wrong and shouldn't be said i just want to put it out there

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,280
so design is an ideology and not a professional profession i've heard a lot

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,559
of engineers say this and it's wrong and it shouldn't be said um

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,919
product design is one of the core part of any project i

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
thought if you want to build a successful company product design is one

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,200
of the key things to focus on so if the end product is quality

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
software why can't designers code so this is another thing that a lot of

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
engineers say that is really wrong um if the end product is quality software

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
why can't designers code this is really wrong

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
and all designers is mandatory code but what's important is um

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
being able to understand um how to communicate your design to the developer

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,600
and he being able to implement it because um the understanding part is

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,120
really will help you working it seems successfully with another developer

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,240
if you can understand and that's what's more important not learning how to write

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,159
code that's not so important for um developers so one on the solution we

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
really need to look at is writing documentation so we need to write

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
documentation that um allows designers to um control

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,200
open social they can just see and follow along on how basically same way we

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,880
document api same way we document um libraries reviewed let's write

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,280
documentation to show how design is uh contributes open source it's a trend

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
that someone has to start someday um someone didn't stop because they

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
believe someone else would at the end no one ends up starting until

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
a couple of years later so in probably one eternity later and so on starts

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
then that's probably when um yeah time has really gone and

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,559
someone needs to start soon so this is basically some resources you can take a

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,240
look at if you want to know more about open source open source initiative and

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
foss and open source google and all these companies doing open source so yeah

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:44,000
um thank you very much thank you so much so let's go ahead and move on

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,480
to alexander public money public code global problems

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,760
need global solutions

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
so you should hear and see me and also my screen so let's get started with my

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,840
talk on public money public code especially during this corona crisis we

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,400
have seen again that global problems need global solutions and we started

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,679
some years ago a campaign called public money public code on this

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
and i want to tell you in the next five minutes how this campaign is connected

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,520
to the current crisis and what happened during the crisis

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,760
and what are our learnings on this so first we

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,480
are the free software foundation europe charity and we want to empower users to

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,640
control technology and this is also true so users are everybody it's

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,720
like us but it's also government states public bodies and

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
so on and that's why we are trying to reach

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360
out to those guys as well so and free software i mean

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,640
we've heard it a lot of times already but just again

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,440
have four freedoms you can use study share and improve the software

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,679
so you can use it for any purpose the code is transparent so you can

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
see what the software does you can analyze it you can share it

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,240
with others without any limitations and also the price doesn't matter

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,760
and you can improve the software which is very important

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,120
when we uh have seen during the crisis and you can modify the software and give

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,120
it back to the community so the question is why should you and

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,200
why should governments public bodies support free software and use it

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,480
so the main the main reason for doing so is that's important for digital serenity

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,200
so in order to establish trustworthy systems public bodies or you

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,120
must ensure that you have the full control over the software and the

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,360
computer systems at the core of your or our state digital

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,919
infrastructure certain free software helps here so and

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,440
also when it comes to public bodies they are financed through taxes so

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,200
through our money and they must make sure to spend the

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,279
funds in the most efficient way possible and so this is why

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,000
we we started this campaign and what we've seen also during the crisis is

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,360
that global problems need global solutions

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,400
and so for example um during this global crisis we have seen that there are

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,720
similar demands all and over all and all over the world um specific

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,440
software and specific hardware is on what's needed just think about the

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,279
tracing apps software for hospitals also

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,279
i think this is something we all just recognize we need to it's for home

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,159
office and remote remote working and this is

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,240
also true for public bodies and to have this global

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,640
solutions we need in the inter -

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,799
interoperability and therefore open standards so we need

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,240
the independence through free licenses free software

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,720
we need to collaborate to foster innovation we need transparency

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,080
to get acceptance by the citizens for our solutions of

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,720
for the solutions from states and we should involve as many stakeholders

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,120
as as needed and as possible and therefore free software is a very good

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,520
idea and also a very good solution so

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,840
um as i already mentioned um i guess you are more or less all familiar with these

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,400
corona tracing apps in the very beginning of this debate we started to

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
get into this debate and said there have to

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,200
be three things happening to have

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
successful apps they have to be used voluntarily they have to respect

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,360
fundamental rights and they need to be free software and um

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,559
what happened is that in the very beginning

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,559
um most of the governments try to um yeah find solutions which are private

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,760
area which are closed source just for their country and during this

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,600
debate it happened that governments easily

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,799
understood that it's a better idea to go to free software

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,200
solutions and in the end for example the european uh

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,440
commission together with the member states

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,559
um just published a paper and said okay so if you are going to have these apps

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,840
there are some recommendations and you have to openly publish

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,120
the technical specifications and the source code for the apps

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,840
and this is very interesting as a way to maximize reuse

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,520
interoperability audibility and security so all our arguments

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,559
have been considered and most of the governments

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,240
started to work in the open on these apps just today the spanish government

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,360
released the tracing for spain we have them in

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,520
germany and in lots of other countries also a

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,400
lot of hackathons happened a lot of yeah public funds were spent

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,799
for these hackathons in order to find solutions

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,240
to tackle this crisis some of them have been free software

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
others not still we are in the debate and trying to get as many as

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,320
possible hackathons to release their solutions as free software

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,400
and also for remote working this is true for us but also for government public

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,679
bodies they have to use a lot of remote working

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,240
tools and what happened during the crisis is

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,840
that most of these public bodies first grabbed the first

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,240
solution they found on the market and then

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,600
during the crisis they have seen that there are issues with data protection

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,279
for example with transparency and acceptance and so more

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,240
and more um debates are starting to have these

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,440
remote tools as well as free software and so this is very

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,799
important for us that we already before the crisis started to

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
demand these public money public code with our

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,399
public money public code campaign and during the crisis

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,320
um yet this campaign was uh very important and that we also worked on

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,840
this issue um years before and we are demanding

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,520
that code paid by the people should be available to the people so if

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,799
it's public money and the code should be also public and

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,039
it should be free software in the end and so we would be happy if you could

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,720
help us with this and sign our campaign and support it if

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
you haven't done so far and yeah also try to promote it whenever

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,159
you talk to public servants and tell them that they have to keep in

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
mind that there's something like free software out there

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,840
um if you have any questions or yeah comments you can also reach out to

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,559
me directly via email or social networks whatever um

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,679
thanks for having me thank you so much alexander

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,039
up next we have ruth and her presentation

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,000
title is a beginning inclusive approach to open source okay

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,600
yeah thank you uh hello everyone uh i'm ruth ikegah from nigeria and i'm a

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,200
python developer i write most of the time technical

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,600
writer and i'm an open source enthusiast mostly

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,000
a beginner open source enthusiast and one fun thing about me is i love

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,960
eating cakes a lot and especially red velvet cakes yeah

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,240
so today i'm going to be talking about um

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,480
a beginner inclusive approach to open source

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,039
now as we have beginners here i would want to

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,360
say um open source is a software development practice for

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,120
developing software in the open with a license that give rights

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,480
to users and developers to use modify and enhance the software but to my own

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,679
definitions what open source means to me is open source is community

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,760
collaboration through a software and

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,559
it's it really means a lot to me because as a beginner i started

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,120
my programming my programming journey in march

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,559
and i was actually i'm going to share my story

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,480
of how i got into open source with you in a few minutes

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,120
so before i got into open source i was just three months into tech

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,520
so i always i always thought um i was not technical enough so i was even

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,679
scared to even make an attempt to um

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
to submit a pr to any project i was so scared of doing it but

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,159
after attending some conferences and talking to some people in the open

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,600
source space i got to understand that i can

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,960
contribute as far it's not just code but i can

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,799
contribute as far documentation i can contribute my

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,760
ideas so i got into open source then another pain point for me was when

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,559
i got in i thought i was asking so many questions

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
that will not being answered so there was a fear of

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,919
asking so many questions i didn't want to disturb the maintainers with my so

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,919
many questions so i was there was this fear of asking

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,799
too many questions at the same time then another pain point i

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,760
i i encountered was the new and confusing tools i had to learn

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,840
because i was just into i was just a few months into tech and

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,559
git was i think git was git was a tool that was very confusing for me i

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,919
to make my first commit i i had to i had to delete the repository like so

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,679
many times i had to i had to um clone i had to do

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,120
it just for a first commit so other tools that were scary to me even

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,320
the communication channels were really very scary i remember

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,320
having issues with irc i was just pop in and i wouldn't know what to do

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
with it so that was most of most of the pain

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,880
points that i i had to encounter as a beginner

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,039
and these these are pain points that you see beginners in tech they actually

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,080
go through because many of them do not even know

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,120
they can contribute to open source with their little skills that they're always

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,159
scared okay i don't know how to actually use

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,880
this to so how do we better this experience

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,559
because i must talk about an inclusive approach this is the state

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
of the source for me to have come to know

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
about um the state of the source and how we can make it better

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,840
so i'm here to tell you an inclusive approach which i've thought about

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
so one first thing i'll start with is empathy

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,440
so when a beginner pops in usually they are usually confused on the project so

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,760
empathy you should apply empathy in answering questions from beginners

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,919
because they they are most times scared of even asking the question so even when

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,960
they when they give that when they um sum up

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
that courage to ask the questions you should apply empathy and answering them

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,200
you should create issues that that you explain with context because most of the

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,440
time when beginners pop into issues even with the good first issue label

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,880
they're still confused about what's the issues about are we reviewing

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,640
prs you should be kind enough to understand that this person is a

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,240
beginner and try to review the prs with with caution and try to correct

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,240
slightly another thing is hand holding so most of

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,440
the time i try to as a beginner as i have

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
um coming to open source i try to handhold others

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,640
to their first pull request so in your open source project as an open source

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,440
contributor you should you should be open to hand

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,200
holding beginners to their pull request because once you

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,080
handholding works like a chain right so once you handhold one person that's one

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,600
person handholds two and two handholds for and good

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
enough if the person is a community helper

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,600
the change just keeps going so hand holding to

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,640
hand holding a beginner to their first pull request

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
the do's and don'ts around the project and community can actually go a long way

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,519
to include beginners in your project

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,320
another thing i want to talk about is um reviewing your onboarding process

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,440
so the world is going diverse and inclusive so you're going to be getting

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,000
contributors from different parts of the world

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,039
with different skill sets and different cultural backgrounds

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,960
you might want to like review your onboarding process get data from people

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,960
that were once beginners to see okay how was this step for you was it actually

00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,519
okay how was your experience so you know how

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
to tailor your onboarding process to suit

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,399
diverse diverse ways so um there was uh this there was this

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,639
conference this google open source event i attended last week

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,200
and there was a particular line i picked up

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,440
and she said a beginner's mind is a great resource so beginners see things

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,399
from the from the from a new perspective so every

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,119
open source project should be inclusive to beginners

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,320
it's not it's not just um our source code or software design pattern

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
that should be open we as open source contributors

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,440
we as open source maintainers we as open source

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,040
enthusiasts we should be open to new contributors

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,200
and to feedback thank you for listening

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,599
thank you so much ruth our last presenter is emmanuel

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,359
with his his title being free open source software movement in

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,640
africa and beyond

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:20,320
free open source software and beyond my name is emmanuel a software developer

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,240
a software engineer at speedline solution i work at a remote

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,640
and also a design lead co-founder at free open source universe

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,599
in ghana advocate for open source

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,079
africa

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,440
africa is a africa is the second largest continent in the world

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,560
with over 1.3 billion population

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,040
yeah um also i'm going to use ghana as a case study ghana is where i stay

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,760
where i live i'm from kumasi ghana um

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,160
ghana as ghana has more than 70 ethnic groups

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,760
which are which include akan gun and so on

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,720
challenges challenges now i'm now start by talking of now

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,280
let me start talking about the movement the free movement of open source in

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,040
africa and the challenges we have within our

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,240
community sometimes when you meet um when you when

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,760
you come across when you come across some of the

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,000
software engineers in ghana and you talk about open source

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,839
majority of them don't understand um the useful usefulness of open source

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,920
and how they can get into open source or how they can get

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,960
started with open source so um our community

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,800
we sat down and we decided okay um since majority of the software

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
developers in africa in ghana especially ghana

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,440
doesn't understand the open source movement

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,960
so why can't we educate them and why can't we

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,160
do something so that they can all get involved
