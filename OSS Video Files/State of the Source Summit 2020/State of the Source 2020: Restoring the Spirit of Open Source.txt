Description: 
	Restoring the Spirit of Open Source
Thierry Carrez

Open source is ubiquitous today. However a lot of projects only respect the letter of open source, by choosing an open source license. They do not respect the spirit of open source: the freedoms and rights granted to open source users, guaranteeing key benefits and the advancement of innovation for all. In this talk we'll explore the state of open source in 2020, the attacks it is facing, and discuss a path forward to restoring the spirit of open source.
