Title: State of the Source 2020: Restoring the Spirit of Open Source
Publication date: 2020-09-23
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	Restoring the Spirit of Open Source
Thierry Carrez

Open source is ubiquitous today. However a lot of projects only respect the letter of open source, by choosing an open source license. They do not respect the spirit of open source: the freedoms and rights granted to open source users, guaranteeing key benefits and the advancement of innovation for all. In this talk we'll explore the state of open source in 2020, the attacks it is facing, and discuss a path forward to restoring the spirit of open source.

hello everyone thanks for having me here in this

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,880
wonderful virtual event discussing the state of the source in

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,000
2020. my name is thierry carrez i'm based in

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
france and i work for the openstack foundation

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
which is an osi affiliate organization

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,920
so if i had to summarize in one word the state of open source in 2020

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
i would say that open source is now ubiquitous

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,559
a synopsis study shows that it's been adopted by 99 percent

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:50,879
of companies in 2020 compared to only 39 percent 10 years ago that's huge

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,120
another study this one by tidelift says that 70 percent of products software

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
products are composed of more open source code

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,560
than proper joy code in 2019 open source has really become a standard

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,240
in how to produce software

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,560
so open source is ubiquitous and yet it's hard to say that open source has

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
one while open source is a critical part of

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,240
most products and services in 2020 most products and services are

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
still proprietary we also see a lot of code released as

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840
open source but where contribution is limited to a

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
single company which prevents you from scratching your

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
own itch we see a lot of open source being

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,399
provided as a service but where the code used to provide it as

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,840
a service is proprietary which prevents you from

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,960
understanding it or duplicating it we see open source as the default way of

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,399
producing software but in a lot of cases it just becomes

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
yet another abundant personal fork on github

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,360
with no hope of ever forming a vibrant community

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,239
and finally we still see a key gap between producers of the software and

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,000
consumers of the software resulting in a lot of

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
users but not so many contributors that

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
creates tension for maintaining projects

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,239
and what about those attacks against the osi

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
the open source definition is outdated they say

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,920
it prevents successful businesses to be formed on open source they say

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
something has really gone wrong along the way

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,480
in the last 10 years we lost something it's really time to go back to the

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,720
basics like what is open source

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,400
open source is not a business model at the root

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,480
open source is just a definition maintained by the open source initiative

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
it defines essential freedoms and rights that software licenses must allow in

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,599
order for the licensed software to be called open source

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
those essential freedoms and rights derive from the free software for

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,159
freedoms with extra emphasis added on user rights

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,000
to encourage ubiquitous usage and historically those freedoms and

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,400
rights associated with free and open source

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,360
software have led to a number of benefits there is

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,200
availability the fact that there is no barrier

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,959
monetary or contractual or otherwise to trying out the software with all of

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
its functionality the fact that you can simply evaluate

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,120
the software for future use experiment with it or just have fun with

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
it the fact that there is no friction in

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,319
transitioning from that experimentation to production

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
there is sustainability source code being available for

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,199
anyone to modify means that you are not relying on a single vendor

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
for long-term maintenance and you are not locked in

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,800
there is a fluid job market where it's easier to identify and attract talent

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,320
enterprises can easily identify potential recruits

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,840
based on the open record of their contributions

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
to the technology that they are interested in

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,800
and conversely candidates can easily identify with the open source

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,360
technologies an organization is using they can join a company with certainty

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
that they will be able to capitalize on the software experience that they will

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,960
grow there there is transparency where access to

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
the source code means being technically able to look

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,800
under the hood and understand by yourself how the

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
software works or why it behaves the way it does

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
and one step beyond that there is surf service

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,199
with the ability to take and modify the source code

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,240
meaning you have the possibility to find and fix issues

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,880
by yourself without even depending on a vendor

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,960
and finally there is influenceability with open source you have the

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,280
possibility to engage in the community developing the software

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,039
and to influence its direction by contributing directly to it

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,039
organizations that engage in the open development communities are more

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,400
efficient they can anticipate changes they can voice concerns about decisions

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,759
that would adversely affect them they can make sure the software adapts

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,360
to their future needs by growing the features that they will

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
need tomorrow

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
and those are not abstract or philosophical benefits

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,479
those are all practical undisputable business benefits

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,520
and they led to the massive adoption of open source

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
in our industry and to the popularity of open source

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,160
as a brand but deep below at the core open source

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,759
is still just a set of licenses and given time and resources businesses

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,800
have found multiple ways of abiding to the latter of those licenses

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,560
but not the spirit of those licenses it is possible to respect the terms of

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
the license while denying freedoms and rights that

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,160
the license were meant to encapsulate

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,720
co-optation means appropriation of something

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,639
for a new or different purpose and that that really is what those businesses did

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,599
they effectively co-opted open source they did so by

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,240
inventing new ways of producing open source

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,960
or new ways of providing open source like they found ways to do open source

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,319
while retaining control and by retaining control they deprived

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,039
users of key benefits like sustainability or influenceability

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,360
they invented opencore a way to use open source as

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,080
trialware pretending to be open source to sell what is ultimately

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,360
a proprietary product depriving users of benefits like availability

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,039
and the emergence of cloud computing enables software as a service models

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
those are purely around running the software

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
and they insert a layer between the hand users

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,599
and the open source developers and by doing that

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,599
they deprived users of benefits like transparency

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,639
or self-service so that is how the spirit of open source

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,759
the traditional benefits associated with open source

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,960
were eroded it started as various experiments

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,479
but soon they claimed to be the new normal

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,800
default way of doing open source

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,240
we were used to resisting to proprietary software

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,159
but this time the attack was coming from the inside

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,839
from so-called commercial open source software companies

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,920
painting open core as the default way of producing open source

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
and more recently they felt sufficiently confident to attempt

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,720
to redefine open source to actually remove freedoms

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,440
they tried to make non-complete licenses be recognized as open source licenses

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,640
non-complete licenses are licenses where it's forbidden

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
to commercially compete with you it obviously discriminates

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,360
on fields of endeavor which is a key part of the open source definition

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
but it also shows that those companies consider open source

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
not as a commons to cultivate but as an asset

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,519
to control and monetize and when the osi resisted that attack

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,080
they started to undermine the osi authority

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
and legitimacy open source is not for them to define they said

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,760
so that's the stat state of the source sad state of the source in 2020

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,480
it's high time we regroup and fight back

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
but before we discuss tactics i think we should

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,839
first agree on the end goal what do we really want open source to

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,440
enable i thought about this and converge to

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,959
four desirable outcomes that open source in

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
my opinion should ultimately provide

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,839
the first one is making technology accessible to everyone

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
at the root open source is all about facilitating distribution

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,399
and availability of software using open source we can make sure

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
technology is equally accessible to all humans on the planet

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,279
we can make sure every company in the world is given the means

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,000
to technically compete with the giants we can avoid monopolies and monocultures

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
for greater resilience

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,440
the second goal is enabling permissionless innovation

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
open source removes barriers through remixing and improving technology

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,079
maximizing innovation this innovation can happen

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,360
without asking for permission from the incumbents

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,600
the third goal is reducing duplication of effort

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,839
too much energy on this planet is wasted reinventing the wheel in every tribe

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,519
this is no longer sustainable open source

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,399
allows everyone to openly collaborate to build common solutions

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,040
avoiding duplication of the same effort everywhere

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,160
and the final goal is cultivating consumers producers

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,000
free software is born in the hacker's community

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,720
from the need to fix a printer as the story goes

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,560
it promised a world where people would see the source

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,320
and be able to modify and improve it it promised a generation of consumers of

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,399
code who would also be producers of code

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,800
knowing how the devices they use actually work not just mindless

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,920
consumers we're far away from that today but i

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
still think open source is the solution to fix it

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,880
and as andrew huang most eloquently put it

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,120
and i'll read the quote the point of open source is not to ritualistically

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,079
compile our stuff from source it's the awareness that technology is

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,760
not magic that there is a trail of breadcrumbs any

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,800
of us could follow to liberate our digital lives in case of

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,160
a potential hostage situation should we so desire open source empowers

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,880
us to create and run our own essential

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,480
tools and services so that's the angle but how do we get

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,920
there what tactics should we employ

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,079
i would argue that first we need to accept

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,920
to go beyond licenses licenses are an essential tool in our

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,079
tool belt to enforce user freedoms and rights but

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,440
in my opinion they are not the only tool we should use

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,279
if we want to restore the spirit of open source

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,040
and reach the objectives that we just defined we need to use

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,760
other tools in particular licenses apply to the resulting software

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,480
they say nothing about how the software should be

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,959
built and how the software is built

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,720
actually matters co-operation of open source with control

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,160
was made possible because we say nothing about the how

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,279
and we all know how to openly collaborate to produce open source

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,079
that preserves all the benefits i mentioned earlier

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
open collaboration on the level playing field

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
welcoming everyone with vendor mutual governance

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
guarantees everyone can join and participate

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
that the software is free from vendor locking

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,720
that everyone has the ability to influence the direction of the software

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,399
so i would advocate for the need to clearly distinguish

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
healthy and sustainable collaboration patterns like open collaboration

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,360
from toxic patterns like single vendor open source

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,800
or open core development we should agree on a clear taxonomy of those patterns

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,320
and speak with a common voice

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,880
what about open source foundations well they usually

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
provide a trademark asset log which helps

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,040
at making development more neutral but beyond that they're all different

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,199
it's not as simple as all c3 charities are good and all

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,560
c6 trade associations are bad you have to look at the details

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,120
for example with trade associations you'll see that in a lot of cases

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
the open source projects are not governed by the foundation they're

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
housed under they have their own independent

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,160
governance body distinct from the trade association

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,279
paying members you will see that some foundations care

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,199
about the how and could divide it so that only truly

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,079
open collaborations are accepted like apache software foundation has the

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
apache way or the openstack foundation has the four

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
weapons

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,399
and once we're ready to speak with a common voice

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,399
we'll need to go educate again we were good at promoting open versus

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,560
closed free software against proprietary but as

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,040
open source became ubiquitous we stopped educating people and we

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,800
opened our site to internal attacks so we need to speak again about the

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,720
spirit of open source speak again about our end goals and

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,160
denounce co-optation that drives us away from those end goals

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,440
and i would like to encourage the osi membership

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,720
to take on that fight thank you for your attention

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:43,279
so please add your questions to the shared notes i see one from gael there

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,279
um i had the impression that software the service models

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,800
work very well with a gpl license don't you think that it's sometimes an

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
attempt to not create an ecosystem around the project and still claim it's

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,120
open source yes obviously i mean there's a very good

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,000
blog article from from bradley at the software conservancy on

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,559
on the the state of copyleft licenses and and how they've been in some cases

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,640
at gpl in particular used in

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,319
in nefarious ways and not their their initial initial goals and uh

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,839
yes the problem is a gpl if you start adding especially

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,240
contributor license agreements to it is is a way to uh

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,960
to build an uncomplete license and uh if you if you are the only one being

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
able to contribute to a project and at the same time

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:48,480
uh you you um you force everyone to just

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,679
contribute their their changes if they're running the software it

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,600
creates a dynamic there that that is clearly not

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,039
balanced and uh

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,520
and really really functional follow-up question um so cla are

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,679
signal of bad

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,919
well clas it's there is clas and clas so uh like uh usually you have clas

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,600
attached to the apache license that are not necessarily about copyright

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,280
assignment or giving up control over your contribution

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,679
um so you have to look into the details but

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,120
they've been traditionally used together copyright assignments clas and

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,039
and um and agpl have been used in the past

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,400
to to provide very strong control over over a project question from peter

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
any thoughts for someone trying to set up a non-profit project for

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,480
software for public benefit listening to speakers today

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,240
i have a combination of idealism and despair yes

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:06,160
i don't really have any any suggestion there um it

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,440
really depends on the case and uh but there are lots of people that can help

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
you try to find with more details on on what

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
you're what you're after uh try to find the right structure there

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,520
are lots of options um and depends entirely on the dynamics of

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
the project i will not say that like everything

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
needs to go to the openstack foundation or i think gael would not say everything

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
needs to go to the eclipse foundation it's really a question of what you're

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
after what type of software you're running what type of community you want

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,320
to join and and and exactly what you expect from

00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:49,851
it's it's a very adversarial world where we're like if you're you're part of that

00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:52,492
community you're the enemy of my community and

00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:56,012
what you realize once you start sharing is that

00:19:56,012 --> 00:20:00,572
you can learn a lot from from anyone's experience

00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:04,892
and i remember going to uh to a kubecon a few

00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:11,532
years ago once we could still travel and and reaching out to the communities

00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:15,052
community and try to bring the experience from the openstack world

00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:21,612
uh and try to to talk about what we did what we did wrong what did right

00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:25,532
what what mistakes their their they might be making in our

00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:29,211
footsteps um and and that discussion was really

00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:33,932
really interesting and what we're seeing is that um on

00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,932
especially on contributor onboarding there is a lot of diversity

00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:42,492
in the way people

00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:48,252
start onboarding new members and there are plenty of solutions that can

00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,692
be shared and and and thought in common so

00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:55,772
my my recommendation would be to to share

00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:59,292
more uh your experience doing it with others

00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,412
having the same the same kind of problems and uh

00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:05,692
and see how you can you can do this on boarding better

00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,812
um but obviously onboarding new contributors

00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:13,772
is uh is an ongoing challenge for all projects

00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:19,372
it's used not to be much of a problem for uh for openstack because there were

00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:23,211
so many uh companies throwing resources

00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:28,892
and contributors at it but today with less vendors and more users more direct

00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:33,532
users we're we're uh in the same stage as as most

00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:36,812
most open source projects we're looking for more contributors who are trying to

00:21:36,812 --> 00:21:39,132
onboard new contributors we're reaching out to

00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:45,772
universities to try to uh to uh train them to uh using the

00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:51,211
software and contributing to it um really early on and and so

00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:55,612
i think and like kubernetes which is like the the real hotness right now is

00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:58,572
also in some cases struggling to find

00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:01,211
contributors to do the strategic contributions

00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:06,412
like qa and release management and and so it's it's it's a very common

00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,172
problem and it should be discussed in common with the growth of

00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:13,772
the open source ecosystem are we stretching available resources

00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:17,372
too thin i don't think so like open source is is

00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:22,892
extremely successful and if we could just uh

00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:29,372
like have this culture that you should it's it's appropriate to give

00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:41,445
uh to fix the culture that it's completely okay to uh consume the

00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:47,125
project without helping producing it and and today it's it's like yeah you

00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:52,725
can do it so why not do it and it's almost like like

00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:55,924
someone there was there was a presentation earlier on the comments and

00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:59,765
and there was this quote from other and cockroft at amazon and it's like oh it

00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:02,325
makes business sense to just take you know and

00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:06,005
if you if you if you give back you're just like

00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:09,684
you're not doing it right and so if you can

00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:12,725
say that at a conference without that being

00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:18,245
uh extremely frowned upon and and it means we need to change the culture

00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:23,924
around around consuming open source and it should not be normal to consume

00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:28,005
without without contributing something back to

00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:31,525
to the project one way or another

00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:36,965
question from josh if you could ask the osi to do just one thing

00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:40,245
uh i've been asked that question before by osi i

00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:43,684
still have to think about it my brain is not working right now

00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:51,125
uh if i just have one wish um i think uh what you presented josh in

00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,565
your keynote uh on layers is i think really

00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:59,044
interesting i think we need to grow um

00:23:59,044 --> 00:24:03,205
i mean we need like like i said it in in one of my slides like

00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:09,605
we need to go beyond licenses and and uh and add layers on yes

00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,445
there is you can you can just like publish your software

00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:19,765
with an open source license that's good making making it openly developed that's

00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:23,924
better and and making it openly governed that's even better and

00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:30,565
be extremely clear that those are layers as important as the the open source

00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:34,885
definition that we use for the licenses i think that that will really

00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:38,485
help in in spreading the word on the right

00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:42,565
way of doing it because it's way too easy for

00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:50,164
for uh groups of people companies to to hide their bad open source in the

00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:54,645
middle of of our good open source and and everyone is

00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:57,965
using the same word like it's open source so it's good

00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:05,205
and it's hard enough to fight all the people that like are assumed to

00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:08,085
be open source but are not 3d like because

00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:13,284
their messaging is confusing like github or or travis ci

00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:18,565
or others that are that that are so embedded in the open source world that

00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:23,924
people assume that they're open source um and but there are also so many

00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:27,525
so many groups that are claiming to do open source well the only thing they

00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:32,245
have in common with really open collaborations is

00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:36,245
the license that they are using and now we have

00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,445
sometimes more in common with with proprietary

00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:43,125
software than with some of the open source software depending on how that

00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:48,005
software is actually developed so they're proprietary

00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,365
software that is more openly developed than

00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,485
some open source software and that worries me

00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:59,284
how could you teach the spirit of open source

00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:05,125
should we take an approach more from a more sociology perspective

00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:10,485
yes i think that that would definitely help i see that

00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:15,765
using other other other domains to find the right way of explaining those things

00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:20,325
is really useful uh but i think we need to we need to uh

00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:23,924
start talking with the same words because we're we

00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:27,125
like like someone said in the notes we're preaching to this

00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,284
to the choir here where like everyone is basically agreeing with me

00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:35,524
what we need to do is start using the same words to think about it so that

00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:41,924
we demultiply our uh our when we talk about it that it reaches

00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:46,485
is more than just uh us you know and and hopefully

00:26:56,836 --> 00:27:00,356
for open source so i will not have time to address the

00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:11,637
last question but i'll try to type in the notes

00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,317
