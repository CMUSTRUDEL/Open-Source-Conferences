Description: 
	Why Database Projects Can't Leave Licenses Alone
Josh Berkus

You may have heard the controversy around new licenses like the SSPL, Commons Clause, and CAL. It's not a coincidence that these come from database software; in fact, it's a tradition. For the last 25 years, database projects and vendors have been messing around with licenses. Learn about the history of database licensing and enforcement, including MySQL, Ingres, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and more. We'll delve into the reasons why they change licenses, and what some alternatives are.

hello

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,200
if you've come to learn about why

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,000
database projects can't leave licenses

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,920
alone

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,920
and all the licensing follies of

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,240
databases and database companies then

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
you are in the right place

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
my name is josh burkus i work for red

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
hat for the open source practice office

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
but

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,199
i'm not doing this presentation for red

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,160
hat instead i'm doing this presentation

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
for me because i've been a database geek

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,040
for a long time

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
and i've been a licensing geek for

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
almost as long what you can get from

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
that is well

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,079
i'm old but also i'm a bit pedantic and

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,440
you are about to get the benefit of that

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,440
but before we go into ancient history

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,600
let's go into recent history namely 2018

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,879
because in 2018 there were a number of

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,920
announcements and a number of

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,399
controversies

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
and a huge stir among technical social

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,760
media and a lot of people getting

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,760
angry and getting into arguments on

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,000
twitter starting with

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
redis who announced the commons clause

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
which they were adding to a bunch of

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
their code

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
and people found this very controversial

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
and then mongodb

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
who changed their open source license

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
from the agpl to a brand new license

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,439
they'd written called the sspl

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
which people had a lot of opinions about

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,799
and then confluent

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
took a bunch of their modules around

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
kafka and changed them from an open

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,640
source license to a proprietary license

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
and then cockroachdb took the whole

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,799
database engine that used to be open

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
source

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,600
and re-licensed it as a proprietary sort

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
of time delay source release license

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
and a lot of people were asking why all

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,119
these announcements and why are people

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
making all of these changes

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,320
and most of all why is it always

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
databases

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
well i stole database geeks we're not

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
surprised by this

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,680
i mean monty may look a little surprised

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
in this picture believe me he's not he's

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
seen

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,960
more of this than i have which i'll go

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
into in a minute

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,280
but we've seen this before in fact

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
database companies

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,759
have always tinkered with licenses all

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
the time they can't leave them alone

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,720
we could also say this is databases

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,319
making bad license decisions since 2000

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,239
but before we go into bad licensing

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,080
decisions let's go into

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
good licensing decisions or at least

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
normal ones right

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,599
when you start in regular open source

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
project non-database

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,680
regular open source company how do you

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
do it right it's a pretty simple path

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
first you develop in private you do some

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,280
maybe some proprietary development

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
because you haven't released it yet

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
and then you launch the project when you

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
launch your company at the same time you

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
choose a popular open source license

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
that fits with your goals and with your

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,480
business model then you try to build an

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,360
ecosystem

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,360
and a community around that project and

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
around your products

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
maybe down the line you have to rev the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,319
license

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
to the next release of the license next

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
version of the license

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,760
i make you get acquired or you ipo

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
and you have to change the license and a

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,280
few modules but mostly you pick a

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
license you stick with it

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
you don't change a lot of things it's

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
pretty simple

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,959
and that's actually good because license

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
stability is good

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
and licensed stability is good because a

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
license is not

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
just a license

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
licenses are a social contract with you

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,319
and your community

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,319
license to set financial expectations

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
for the businesses

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,560
in your commercial ecosystem as well as

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
the legal conventions around who can

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,799
copy the code who can modify and

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,799
everything else

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,879
so when you make changes to a license

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,000
you are changing all of those things

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,239
at once it is intensely disruptive

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which is why you generally don't want to

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
do it instead

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
pick a popular license change as little

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,400
as possible

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
if you do have to change it then

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,959
socialize each change well

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,200
in advance and a license changes if they

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,560
are harmful

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,560
the alternative involves getting a lot

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,599
of angry emails and a lot of angry

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
direct messages

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,640
from your partners and from members your

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,319
ecosystem and from your community

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,840
and then there's the data way

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
which is complicated now every database

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,239
starts

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,600
as a fork of another database or almost

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:18,959
every database and then

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
there's a whole bunch of other things

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
that go on with different licenses

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
and unapproved licenses multiple

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
versions of licenses

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
and client modules under a different

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
license and maybe

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
even taking the whole thing proprietary

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
again

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880
but rather than discuss this in theory

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,600
let's

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,800
talk about a few examples and of course

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
we can't talk about open source

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,479
databases without talking about

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,080
mysql now

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
if you've been around for a while you

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
might know that mysql

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
as originally released was not open

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
source in 1995

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,360
it was released under a license that was

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
free for personal use

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
but you had to have a contract for

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
commercial use this kind of licensing is

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
known as shareware

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,800
and it has a long and broad tradition

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
going back in the software world is

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
still used today

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,639
now mysql allegedly had some code from

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
msql according to some people were there

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,440
at the time i don't really know

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
um that was also the clearwater thus

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
every database is a fork of another

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
database

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,280
but that doesn't really matter for their

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,320
licensing

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,360
so then in 2000 things

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,360
changed they re-released mysql as

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,120
gpl version 2. and monty became a huge

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,320
champion of the gpl and free super fire

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
now the database client was under the

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,960
lgpl to make it compatible with

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
different legalized

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,240
programming languages and clients and

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,280
tools

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,080
but even though monty was a big champion

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,360
of free waiver

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,199
mysqla b the company

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
promoted this idea that if you were

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
doing open source hacking then you could

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
use the gpl version of mysql but if you

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
were using mysql

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,840
in a business however you were using it

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,600
you needed to get a commercial license

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,759
from them

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
and this scheme was called dual license

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,680
now you will notice that these terms

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
sound very similar to what i earlier

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,960
called

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,479
shareware and it is similar but dual

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
licensing has been around for quite a

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,360
while

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,800
as one of the primary ways to make money

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
off of open source

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
which was fine until 2004 when they

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
suddenly and by suddenly i mean

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
in a minor update changed the license of

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,160
the database client

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,600
to gpl 2.0 and this caused a lot

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,680
of pushback and

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
gnashing of teeth because they also

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
introduced an enterprise edition

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,199
they had to have this false exception

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
thing the community manager got

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,360
intensely frustrated

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
and walked out of the company and the

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
big

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,360
big issue about this is that

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
probably two-thirds three-quarters of

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,440
the developers work with mysql were

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,000
writing in php and one of the licenses

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,800
that is not compatible with the gpl

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
at the time anyway was the php license

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
so suddenly

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
the majority of mysql's developer

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
audience could no longer use the

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
database and so they had to add

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
this thing called a php exception but

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,599
after a while they found that it wasn't

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,479
good enough so they added this false

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,520
exception to cover

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,960
other open source in order to allow them

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,919
to still use the database even though

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,919
everything was gpl now

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
and i'll give you a hint if you find

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,039
yourself doing something like this

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
you've made a bad decision somewhere up

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
the line

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
and maybe it's time to stop and take

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,919
three steps back and revisit your

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,360
goals now well mysql

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,120
is the best known open source database

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
it's not the oldest let's talk about

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,000
ingress

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,720
now english is maybe the second database

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
relational database out there 1974

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
started at uc berkeley

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
got spun out to a for-profit ingress

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,960
corporation 1980 then got acquired by

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,319
ask

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
then that got acquired by computer

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
associates so it has been around the

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,360
block

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,280
30 years of history before 2004 it went

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
open source

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
however it didn't get released under any

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
of the licenses that were popular at the

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
time it got released

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,879
under a brand new license written by

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,919
computer associates called the trusted

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,759
open source license

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,840
it was sort of apache mozilla-ish but

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
different and

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,199
now they did submit this to the osi and

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,039
they did get the license approved

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
but even though it was approved this one

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,000
license that was only used for two

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
projects anywhere

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
wasn't even used elsewhere in ca gave

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
people a lot of trouble they weren't

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,240
familiar with the license they didn't

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
understand it

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
developers were nervous about it users

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
were nervous about it and as a result it

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839
became a big inhibition

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,040
to ingress getting the kind of adoption

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,320
that mysql and postgresql were seeing

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
so in 2005 uh ca

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,920
spun off ingress ingress corporation no

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
not that ingress corporation not the one

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,000
from the india's that was gone this is a

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
brand new

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
english corporation coincidentally with

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,800
the same name

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
and that english corporation reevaluated

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
and took two steps back and then

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,760
re-released ingress under the gpl

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
version 2.

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,200
now so under popular open source license

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,920
that should be the end of our story

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,519
except that they forgot to socialize the

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
license change with an important group

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,000
of people namely

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,120
the english developers many of whom were

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
actually very anti-gps and they were

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,560
very

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,560
loudly anti-gpl and as a result the

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,120
change to the gpl did not really do

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,200
ingress any good in terms of adoption

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,640
so the database hung around for a while

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
went into sort of a

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
decline never really saw a lot of

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
popularity in open source

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,880
until 2010 they had their last open

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
source release and by 2017

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
it had been combined with another

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,640
database and released under proprietary

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,720
license called actionx

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,160
now one last old database before we get

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,440
into newer stuff

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,279
interbase great database was released as

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
open source quickly the name was not

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,880
released also so they had to rename it

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
into firebird database

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,440
um the open source version that is and

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,720
before we go into what was wonky about

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,560
firebird inner base um

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
i need to introduce a term that is often

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,720
used in license review

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
now if you watch a lot of python you

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
have

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,279
probably seen the sketch with eric idle

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,279
and john cleese where eric idol is

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,600
trying to get a license for his pet fish

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,360
and as part of the sketch he hands john

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
cleese a cat license and john cleese

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
famously said

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,720
that's not a cat license that's a dog

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,279
license where you cross dog out and

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
wrote cat on it in crayon

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,279
and thus originated the term crayon

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
license because a lot of

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
companies seem to be unable to resist

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
taking a popular well-known

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,959
well-understood license

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,320
and just modifying it a little to make

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
it their own

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,760
thus leading to problems

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
now how this relates to interbase

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,200
firebird here is it was released under

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
two different licenses

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
one was called the ipl which was a sort

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
of hacked version

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
of the mozilla public license and it was

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,399
called the idpl which applied to

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,360
different parts of

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,959
inter uh firebird's code which was also

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,279
a hacked version of the mpl so you had

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,360
two different crayons

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,240
versions of the mpl applying to

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
different parts of the code

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
and neither of these were submitted to

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
the osi i don't think they were

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,399
submitted certainly they were never

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,880
approved by the osi and as you can

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,839
imagine this led to some problems with

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,959
firebird attracting

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,959
contributors to the project

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,560
now enough with the ancient databases

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,800
let's actually come up to more recent

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,079
times let's talk about mongodb

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,760
released in 2009 under the agpl version

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
3 license now

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,320
today the agpl is an accepted mainstream

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,440
license but at the time it was still

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,279
controversial it was relatively new

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
it had these network copyleft

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,720
permissions which were

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,920
very controversial among a lot of people

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
they weren't sure that they were legally

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,120
enforceable they weren't sure that they

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,720
should be enforced et cetera

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
and for a startup that was also the

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,480
controversy around

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
combining the hdpl with a contributor

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
license agreement

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,279
which then kind of de facto made for a

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,720
combination

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,760
where commercial usage by

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,760
other companies was very very difficult

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,200
thus sort of turning it into

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
non-commercial shareware again at least

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,800
if you

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,000
follow this theory

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,399
however that controversy did not in the

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
end

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560
hurt mongodb at all as america

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
tremendously successful saw huge

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,480
adoption lots of users

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
and eventually a very very successful

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,800
ipo in 2017

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
so lots of stock made a bunch of money

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,320
and their stock has continued to do well

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,920
after that but one of the things that

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,279
comes along when you have a big market

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,200
cap and lots of stockholders

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,040
is pressure to constantly increase

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
revenue and constantly increasing

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,320
revenue means getting creative and we're

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,760
talking about a database company here

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,360
so what do you think they did yep

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,680
of course a new license mongodb

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
released their new version under the

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,279
server side public license

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,519
they had just drafted and then they

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,720
submitted it to

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,160
the osi but here's the thing

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,800
the sspl made some very

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
radical extensions to the domain of

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
copyleft to the things that the license

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
applied to

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,800
and therefore required to be open source

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
and this resulted in months five months

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
of intense debate

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
unlicensed review about whether you

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
could make those sorts of changes and

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,079
whether the wording

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
was good and whether or not you should

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,320
make those kinds of changes and all

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
these other things

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,480
and eventually what happened was mongodb

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
got really tired of all this debate a

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,600
lot of it was fairly acrimonious so i

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:50,240
can understand this

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,320
and withdrew the sspl from consideration

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,079
which means that mongodb is still being

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
released under the sspl and it

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
might be open source and it might not be

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,120
open source and we just

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,240
don't know now one last database in our

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,079
little tour here

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,079
one of my favorites redis was released

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,560
in 2009

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,920
along with a lot of their non-relational

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,320
databases

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
under the bsd license so super

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
permissive created by salvador san

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
felipo while he was working for vmware

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,959
and it wasn't a product which is part of

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
the reason why it could be

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,959
so permissive it was not commercialized

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,920
at all for for years really

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,279
but it did get extremely popular because

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
lots of people liked it

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,399
developers liked it database geeks like

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,000
it i liked it a lot

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,240
um still like it and eventually somebody

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,279
said hey this database is so popular we

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,959
should create a stop around it

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,800
so they did they launched redis labs and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,760
redis labs hired salvatore away from

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,360
vmware

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
and they added a bunch of enterprise

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,920
features to make money and the

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,279
enterprise features were lice

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,959
not bsd license they were listed

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,800
differently from the core engine

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
some under the apache license and some

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,360
under the agpl v3 license see there's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,760
the

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,480
gpl again and that was okay for a couple

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,720
of years

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
um people were used to that you know if

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,240
they were using the enterprise features

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,000
different licenses applied and then

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,240
redis announced this called the commons

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
clause let me read you a phrase in the

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
commons clause right

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,800
the grant of rights under the license

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,160
will not include in the license does not

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
grant you the right to

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,199
sell the software

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,680
it is non-commercial this was added as a

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,000
rider onto the apache license

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,440
you know apache plus commons clause and

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,959
it had a strict non-commercial

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,480
restriction

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,040
allowing redis labs to at the same time

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,360
produce

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,440
both shareware and a crayon license

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,759
which is some kind of an accomplishment

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,079
and as a result they had to then

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,839
get rid of some fud and explain no the

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,199
core engine is still bsd you can still

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
use this this only applies to the

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
modules

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,160
and this was so much trouble that

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,279
eventually they abandoned the whole

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
effort they took those modules and they

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,079
put them under

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,839
a more straightforward source available

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,160
proprietary license

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,959
um and gave up on this whole commons

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
clause thing

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,000
now if you've been listening to me talk

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,040
one of the things you may be asking

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,920
yourself is

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,440
why why are databases like this why do

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
they have to be so complicated why do

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,519
you have to tinker with licenses all the

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
time

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,320
and i asked this question on social

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
media and i got some interesting

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
responses which came down to basically

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
three reasons

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
and one has to do with the unquestioned

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,120
financial leader in the database field

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,040
namely oracle and oracle has made

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,720
billions of dollars and a lot of the way

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,440
they've made that money is via

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,360
licenses licenses for the database and

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,279
licenses for plug-ins and licenses for

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
training and licenses for resellers

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
and reams and reams of paperwork and as

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,680
a result whenever anybody thinks

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,040
how do i make money off this database

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,440
they cannot

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,079
help but think of licensing

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,160
reason number two has more to do with

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,560
startups and venture capital which is if

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
you

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,199
look at database startups they take a

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,079
long time an average of about nine years

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,319
to reach an exit strategy an ipo or an

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,360
acquisition or whatever

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,439
and as a result the vcs by the time of

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,120
this exit they have a huge stake in the

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
database company which means they also

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,559
need to make

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
a lot of money off of that database

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,039
company

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
which means they want them to get

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,400
creative with revenue

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,079
and getting creative for revenue in the

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,799
world of databases so

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,559
often means messing with licensing and

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,400
the last reason i can explain in three

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,720
letters

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,400
s q l structured query language

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,760
an international standard and

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
importantly one

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,039
that commodifies databases it creates a

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,760
universal api for databases

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,360
in theory anyway and as a result

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,799
developers and users have the

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,160
expectation that regardless of what

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,799
database is on the other end of that

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,039
pipe

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,840
it will behave similarly and the problem

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,559
with that

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,360
is that you as the owner of a new

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,440
database

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,039
have to every day compete feature for

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,840
feature and price for price against the

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,799
other databases in the industry

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,880
and even the non-relational databases

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,640
the nosql databases have been pressured

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
to commodify by their users introducing

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
things like gql

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,799
and graphical ql and sql compatibility

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
and the problem with commodification is

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,760
you don't get

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,280
what financers call stickiness

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,720
all the time you have to worry about

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,600
your users defecting because they can

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,559
and as a result this tinkering around

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,520
with licenses

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,960
is never going to leave us so the next

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
time

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
that you are reading hacker news and you

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,720
hear about

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
people having a fight over some licensed

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
terms or another

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,679
and it somehow always seems to involve a

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,880
database well

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,840
just understand that's just databases

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,840
doing what they do

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,760
now thanks everyone and i am now

00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:01,039
prepared to answer your questions

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,919
there we go howdy so

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,440
um if you have questions go ahead see we

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
have any of the shared notes ah

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
do you foresee any uptake of this scale

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,000
in the database space

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,200
i certainly hope so um this is why both

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,720
henrik and i spent so much time

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
talking in license review about the

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
terms and trying to make sure that it

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,840
would be an acceptable license to the

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,880
osi because we're very

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,840
interested in the potential of it

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,360
for database project licensing

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,280
particularly things like distributed

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,840
databases

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:41,600
so far aside from the original

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,480
um uh cryptographic hyperledger project

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,760
um nobody's adopted it yet um but it's

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
still very new

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,400
um and and i'm really hoping that it can

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,559
become a tool for

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,240
public interest databases where they

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,000
want to make sure that they don't get

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
bad actors taking some of the data

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
proprietary

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,200
that was a big part of my hope for the

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,039
license

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
hendrick points out one reason that

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,360
database companies can change licenses

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
is they're often vc funded single vendor

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,559
products

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,720
um and um one thing i'll point out is

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,200
that that's actually not always true

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,240
conspicuously absent from the licensing

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
follies

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,840
was postgresql um i

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,840
also sqlite in fact um

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,400
both of which because those databases

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,520
accepted contributions with no copyright

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,880
assignment

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,919
and as a result are permanently under

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,559
their respective

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,760
licenses um and and unable to re-license

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,400
the um and that's true of linux it's

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,679
true of

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,960
most programming languages um

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,360
i the at one point because

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,320
the postgresql license has the same

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,559
material terms as the bsd license

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,960
but different language we looked at

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,480
changing it to be the bsd three clause

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,679
license to be consistent with other

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,760
projects

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,200
and the amount of effort and the number

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
of people would have to track down some

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,559
of whom

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,320
had passed away so to track down their

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
estate in order to get them to reassign

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,120
things

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,720
um would have been truly nightmarish

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,280
so um but yeah but

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
but henrik is correct that a lot of this

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
has to do

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,200
you know as i say my reasons with

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,640
venture

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,640
capital funded projects

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,120
okay so more questions um

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,039
uh are there any non-vc funded

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,640
uh ludovic said are there any non-vc

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,240
funded database companies

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
which would show that they can fund

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,400
themselves and not

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,120
tinker with the licenses i think or i

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,120
think you mean v

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,039
in numbers of non-vc funded companies

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,120
we have plenty of services companies uh

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,400
the database realm has been popular

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,600
with services companies such as procona

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,840
um such as enterprise db

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,840
such as second quadrant such as

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
um

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,159
there's another multi-database company

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,600
that's primarily mysql but also does a

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,120
lot of other database systems i'm not

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,039
remembering the name right now

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,720
um the um as well as some of the big

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,480
service providers that also offer

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,600
database support

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,200
for some open source databases and for

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
that matter the web hosts

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
right because clearly

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,400
for their mysql and postgresql

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,480
services uh amazon and google and azure

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,080
have not had to touch the licenses

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,600
at all um so

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
it is completely possible to make money

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,799
off of databases without

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,400
monkeying with licensing um and and

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,080
that's been demonstrated it's just that

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,679
you need to go into services and support

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,720
and hosting if you want to take that

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,960
route

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,760
apparently although i would argue

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,760
that the changes to licenses have not

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,440
necessarily benefited these

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,640
vc funded companies um

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,640
does this seem like it's more of an

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
expression of control with clas and dual

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
licensing

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,600
i suppose a lot of it is about control

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,840
um

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:31,919
i'm relatively for all of the ones

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,840
uh such as mysql where i'm familiar with

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
some of the background reasoning that

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,080
went into the license change it's

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,600
very revenue motivated as in

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
there wasn't a motivation for control

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,480
outside of

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,880
creating revenue um in the

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,320
case of mysql it was specifically

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,720
because of the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,400
closed box reseller market and they

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,320
wanted to make sure that those people

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,600
were getting commercial licenses

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,600
um and and that was largely the

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,279
motivation

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
so one more question what do you think

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,679
the db licensing world will look like in

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,679
10 years

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,279
um i think uh that

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,760
in the end most of these databases will

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,760
end

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
up under some mainstream open source

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,400
license

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,960
um except for

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,919
some extension of copyleft like which

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,279
might be cal

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,120
it might be something else i think there

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,000
will be more attempts to extend copy

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
left

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,600
into the area of data because for

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,440
database applications it's increasingly

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,559
difficult to differentiate between data

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,919
and code

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,320
in terms of how these applications

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,080
actually work and so i think we're going

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
to see more extension of copyleft in

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,919
that area specifically for

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
database applications and database

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,360
infrastructure

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,679
beyond that i think as

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,440
happened in previous cycles as happened

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,679
in the cycle in the mid-aughts

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,760
i think a lot of these experiments with

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,960
non-open source licenses

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,400
will ultimately die out

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,320
among other things there are too many

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,799
good databases that are clearly open

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,720
source license competing with them

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,559
and on the proprietary licensing front

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,919
nobody does proprietary licensing better

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,600
than oracle

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,520
and so if you've decided to compete in

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,200
the proprietary license database market

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,000
you're competing with oracle

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,559
which is a tough road to hoe um

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,279
so um i guess i still have time left so

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,919
let's take another question from ludovic

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
yep uh could we argue that all i'm going

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
to summarize

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,559
um we argue that all vc funded database

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,240
plays will end up kinguing license

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,039
therefore go to shareware or

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,799
near proprietary model and thus those

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,880
companies will kill the open source

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,000
nature of the database

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,360
or inspire a split

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,559
in the community um i could see that

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,559
happening i mean

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,840
technically even though it was

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,760
completely

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,440
corporately funded um open elastic

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,600
open elasticsearch um is a a split

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,559
um or a fork if you will prefer the term

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
split because

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,080
with github and everything term fork is

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,360
confusing

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,400
so so technically the elasticsearch

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,840
situation

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,000
is in fact a split specifically over

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,039
licensing

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
so um yeah we'll probably see some of

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,360
that

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,720
um and in the end the other thing that's

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,720
going to happen is that some databases

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
are going to die out people forget

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,840
um i did an accounting for one of the

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,240
startups to work with back in

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,320
2005 and i think

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,279
we had 20

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,320
financially successful as in over 10

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,600
million dollar

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,159
um sql databases

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,000
most of which are gone now um and a lot

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,799
of the databases that people are hearing

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,720
about today

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,320
ultimately will not survive or they will

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,760
merge with something else

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,840
um so i think we're going to see more

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,720
winnowing in that respect

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,400
and playing

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,480
you know with licenses in a way that

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,720
offends your users

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,880
will cause will be a cause of failure

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,120
for some um but not all of them

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,960
so thank you everybody um i am going to

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,600
pop over to

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,880
the red hat open source and business

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,200
hallway

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,720
session i hope to see you there i'll be

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,440
happy if you think of another question

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,120
about this

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,039
go ahead and take it over there and i

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,480
will take it thank you very much

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
everyone for attending this was a lot of

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
fun for me

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,320
i hope it was a lot of fun for you

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,399
thank you josh we appreciate your time

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
and effort and we will see you all in

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:49,840
the next sessions

take care

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,799
