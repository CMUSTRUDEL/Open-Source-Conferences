Description: 
	GPL Exceptions: Filling the Spaces between GPL, LGPL and permissive licenses
Karen M Sandler and Bradley M Kuhn

Exceptions have been a mainstay of copyleft licensing since the creation of the GPL For the casual FOSS developer and integrator, exceptions are a rare discovery in a random source file or two, and they do not command great attention.  However, they are nonetheless an essential part of the copyleft licensing system.

In this talk, Kuhn and Sandler will introduce the general idea of GPL exceptions and how they work to carve out the spectrum of licensing between the GPL, LGPL, and the highly permissive licenses.  Specifically, Kuhn and Sandler will cover in detail the GCC Runtime Library Exception, which they both helped draft.  They will also discuss the AGPLv3 Web Template Output Additional Permission, which was published by Conservancy initially for use by the Houdini project.
