Title: State of the Source 2020: Clear license data with ClearlyDefined
Publication date: 2020-09-18
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	How would you like us to list your license? Clear license data with ClearlyDefined
Carol Smith

Clear license data is fundamental to all open source compliance systems. ClearlyDefined is building confidence and clarity in clear license data. We are a project of the OSI and work collaboratively on license information for all of FOSS.

hi everyone my name is carol smith and i'm an open

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
source program manager at microsoft and i'm here today to talk

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
to you about a project that we've been working on

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,039
that is an incubator project under the osi called clearly defined

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,039
so as some most maybe all of you know when you use a foss project it

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,599
comes with certain responsibilities and those responsibilities are laid out

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,719
in that project's license and if you're using maybe a handful of

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,120
foss components or projects maybe it's not so hard to keep track of

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
those responsibilities and to make sure that you're

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
adhering to all of them but what if you're

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,760
maybe a larger organization or you're an open source project that's building on

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,280
other foss projects and what if you're using thousands

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
of components or maybe hundreds of thousands of components

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
or millions at this scale it becomes much more challenging

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
to keep track of all your responsibilities and to make sure that

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,119
you're adhering to them and this is a challenge

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
for foss consumers it can be difficult to

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
discover the copyright and the license for all of these projects

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
and to make sure that they're all correct and to have confidence in the

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,320
quality of the data that you're getting many foss projects are not clearly

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
licensed or don't have clear copyright information

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
in the cases where you still have to make sure that you have all of that

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
information and if you again are maybe an

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
organization that is trying to keep track of a lot of

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,159
foss components that your organization is using it can be very difficult to get

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,479
the resources to do this compliance work it can be difficult to get the tooling

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,759
in place to get the engineers to work on the

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,560
compliance systems and to make sure that it all

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,000
stays up to date and has the best quality data

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
about the all of the foss that you're using and

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,680
this is difficult as i said at numeric diversity so

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
when you're talking about hundreds of thousands or millions of components

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,720
and it's also difficulty at scale when you're talking about

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,680
diversity across ecosystems so different package managers work in different ways

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
and it can be difficult to keep track of all of that

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
and this can also be very duplicative resource intensive work

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,760
often you can find out the license and copyright and source

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
information about a hundred thousand components on day one

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
and then your dependencies change and you have new

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
projects that you need to find out the license information for

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
and again it can be quite quite difficult quite resource intensive and

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,040
quite duplicative and this is a problem for foss projects

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
because when there isn't clarity it creates

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,440
friction and it can be difficult for a person who doesn't have confidence

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
in how you are licensed how your project is

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,200
licensed to feel confident in using your project because

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
they may not be adhering to the license of your project even

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,800
if they think they know what the license is and if they don't have

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
confidence that might reduce adoption of your project

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,519
or engagement in your project or in your community and

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
this demand for rigger takes resources and

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,159
expertise and compliance and this is not only difficult for foss

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
projects in terms of adoption but it's also difficult for

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
foss projects who are building on other foss projects so

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,200
as a foss project you are yourself using open source and you so you are a

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,159
consumer and so when you are not clear about the license

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,879
of the open source that you are using then it is not clear when you release

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
your project what all of the open source that you've

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
built on and how it is licensed and so you inherit the issues of the

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
dependencies that that you have and then you pass those on

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
to the people who are using your foss

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,480
project and then there's lack of clarity throughout the

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,680
entire pipeline and so because this is such a challenge

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
a huge industry has been built up around this problem around the

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
compliance space and there are lots and lots and lots of

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,400
projects in this space that are all complementary and are all trying to

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
solve slightly different problems and some are meant to work together some

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
are meant to work independently but there's lots and lots of projects in

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
this space that are all focused on slightly different things but clearly

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
defined is interested only in the data these

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
projects are all complementary and work well with clearly defined but

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
clearly defined is focused on on one thing and one thing only which is

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,919
the data itself and having high quality data and giving our users

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,680
confidence in that data and specifically we are interested in

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,919
three pieces of information about foss projects we are interested in

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,440
what is its license what is its source location and what is

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
its copyright information because those are the three pieces of information

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,160
that our users need in order to meet their compliance responsibilities in

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
whatever tooling and whatever system that they're using

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
and this is a difficult problem but it also means

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
that it's a problem that open source is really well

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,160
suited to face if this is an open source problem it's an open source

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,759
uh it's a it's a problem that can be solved with open source

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
um this is a problem that everyone in this open source ecosystem is facing and

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,320
so it is a community problem and we think it is a community solution

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,199
that we can bring to it we want to bring crown source

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
crowdsourcing and transparency and other philosophies in open source to

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,240
this project so let me talk a little bit about how

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,520
this works we are interested in a process that

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,000
involves three parts harvesting curating and contributing

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,240
the first part is harvesting so we go off to the public internet and we run

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,880
tools on open source components in order to discover what their license

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
source location and copyright information is we

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
are running a system that is able to take these packages

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
from from the open source providers where they are from the package

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
managers where they are and run the best quality open source tools in a

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
transparent way on these open source components to

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
discover what their license what their source location

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,319
and what their copyright information is and there are lots and lots of these

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
tools that are out there and we are running a lot of them

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
scan code phasology licensee the list goes on and on so we run all of these

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,960
tools and what we're trying to do is we're trying to discover the best

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,840
quality information and aggregate all of that

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,759
information about these foss components so that we're able to

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,080
create what we call a definition of the open source component which is

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
its license it's copyright information and

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
source location we can then provide that to our users

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
but as you may know even the best automation and even the most tools run

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
in the most transparent way sometimes has missing or ambiguous

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,800
information and so that's where the second part of

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
the process comes in we are interested in providing all of

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,520
the data that we have out to the public and then allowing it

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,280
to be curated by humans in cases where the information

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
needs to be fixed up for some reason and we want to

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
do this also in a crowdsourced and transparent way so

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
not only are we providing the data that we're getting from the automated tools

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
but we're providing that data to the public and then

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
providing a mechanism through which it can be curated so

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,879
we put all of the data in the public on our website and then

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
people can come along and modify that data so for example to

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,120
change the license from mi mti to mit for example if there was a typo and then

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,039
to create a pull request on github that is able to

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,400
be reviewed and commented on by other people in the foss ecosystem to

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,240
to improve the quality of the data and in cases where

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,599
the pr the curation that the person has created

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,759
is correct and the community agrees that it is correct the pr is merged and then

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
the data in clearly defined is augmented and

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
updated and so our users will then have the benefit

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
of these curations to provide even better data around

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,719
these open source components and we don't want to stop there either we're

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
not just interested in creating a larger and larger database of

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
these false components and keeping it we're interested in

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
contributing those prs and those changes back upstream to

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,640
the original projects so we are interested in making a

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,640
a effort with the upstream project to say we have had

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
curations for example on your version 1.1 of your

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,279
foss component and we think that the license is mit

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,560
not mti as was listed on your component if you agree that that's the case we

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,519
have a pr here that you can merge to update your project upstream and then

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
in future versions you will be more clearly defined and we won't need to do

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
curations on on future versions and this is meant to

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
be a virtuous cycle and so over time as we do more of these

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,720
curations as the data quality of the data

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
is improved and as the community of our users

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,600
looks at more uh more of the data and and curates it in cases where it needs

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,399
to be and those are contributed upstream the open source ecosystem as a whole

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,920
components across the board become more clearly defined and

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,200
this is able to be derived more and more from tooling

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,399
and doesn't need to doesn't need to be done

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,519
by humans so there's a few things about the project i'd love to tell you about

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,160
so i mentioned already that this is an incubator project

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,839
under the osi we have been with the osi since the project

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,800
was launched and osi is the home where the project is is kept and our our

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
finance and financial resources are are kept

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
um from the beginning we've always felt that clearly defined

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
aligned incredibly well with the osi's mission of stewarding

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
open source and its licenses um because the osi's

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,600
core mission is around clear licenses and

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
and what the open source definition is and stewarding that

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
we always felt like clearly defined was was well aligned with that and so

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,959
we wanted to make clearly defined uh habits home at osi from the beginning

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,880
and so we have um we also love being with osi because

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,440
it is a vendor and community neutral home

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,120
one of the important philosophies around clearly defined

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
is that we don't think this is anyone's opinion

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,519
we don't want this to be any organization's reflection on

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
the data these are simply facts about the about the

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
foss components that we have been able to derive from tooling

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,000
or from human curation this is not a good or bad judgment and this is not i

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
think that this might be the license but i'm not sure

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
it's we want to base it on on facts and and we want it to be

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
neutral to both communities and to to vendors

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,440
um and clearly defined operates like any other open source community we have

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,720
a community of folks who are engaged in the project we'd love to

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
to have you join as well if you are interested

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
uh but it is also a a project that works out in the open

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
and is a collaboration amongst lots and lots of organizations as well as

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,720
individuals and it is meant again to be vendor and community neutral we have

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
some some core principles and and one of them

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
is actually related to the title of this talk which is

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,839
how would you like us to list your license one of our our core guiding

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,320
principles is that we want to create tooling that best

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
gets the best quality data from these open source

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
projects we don't want to tell open source projects how they should work or

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,680
ask them to to to do additional work in order

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
to accommodate clearly defined in fact we want the reverse we want clearly

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,760
defined to accommodate what the community norms

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
around licenses are and so we want to learn more and more about how

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,519
communities are operating and what is standard and typical for the way that

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
they make their license source location and copyright

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
information available in their communities and then we want the tooling

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,480
to adjust and to suit those communities so

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
that we get the best quality data when we go and and find those open

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
source packages and and scan them and provide the data to to

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,639
our users um and as i mentioned we always want to

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
work upstream with the with the projects not not just

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,200
uh with what their community norms are and how to get the best data around the

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,839
open source that they're producing but also to create

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
prs and to work with them in whatever way makes sense

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,639
to get our contributions to uh make the data better in cases where

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,440
where it's appropriate with them as well um and and we want to meet them where

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
they where they are on that um we also have a guiding philosophy

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,320
that we want all of this to be completely open

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,079
so it's not just uh the project itself but it's every individual part so

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,600
the data itself is open how the each of the tools that we ran and what

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,399
the conclusions they came to about what the license is

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,800
all of the reports that are run by our automated tooling are all completely

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,560
open and available so that someone could do

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
replicate the entire process of getting the same data that we did

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
from start to finish so that it is all clear and there is no

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,320
ambiguity about how we came to a conclusion or a fact about the open

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,639
source that we are about the data that we are providing

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
about that open source component um all of the infrastructure

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,079
is is open and all of the processes the around the curation

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,079
and around our community working together is all open um and as i

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,279
said before all of the data is factual this is not

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,839
uh an interpretation or a judgment um even in the cases where we are having

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,480
humans do curations those humans and those pr's need to be based on facts

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
so for example um i have uh you know they have to

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,760
provide a link to a mailing list where the project was

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
re-licensed and what what the conversation was

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,079
um about that re-licensing and make it clear that the community

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,279
wanted that re-licensing and this is why for example maybe the data

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,079
was was ambiguous before um it always has to be based on facts it can't be

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,160
someone's judgment and it can't be an interpretation we

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
also have a guiding principle that we want

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,920
things to be simple as well the infrastructure and the tooling we run to

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
get the data is is quite quite simple and it's meant to

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,639
be as well as all of the processes we don't we don't want this to be

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,320
complex and we and we always make choices that are in the interest of

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,560
simplicity clarity um and quality uh over

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,320
over other things uh and finally i mentioned this before but

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
it's quite important to us that all of the community processes and the entire

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,480
on all of the data be completely neutral we don't have a

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
affiliation or a company company driven focus and this is another reason

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,079
again that we are with the osi um i'll talk just for a minute about how

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
the process actually works so as i mentioned on the on the far left

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,079
of your screen you'll see the package managers and the ecosystems

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,120
that we want clearly to find to work in

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,920
there's actually in fact many more ecosystems that are

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
represented by the data that we haven't clearly defined now but this is

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,199
this is just an example of some of them um so these are all places where

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,480
open source packages live and we again go to the public internet and we

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,959
take down those those packages and then we call that process harvesting

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,399
and we open up those packages those binaries

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
whatever they may be and we scan them we run we run tools on

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,720
them so things like scan code and fossology and licensee

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,880
and others and we run all of the all of these tools in an effort to

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,279
again get the best data that we can uh and then that is

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,040
publicly available right right from the get-go so as soon as we

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,480
get the the information and we're we're done scanning we make it publicly

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
available on our website and vr apis um and

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,399
and that's available to users from from there but then in the middle you can see

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,880
that again in some cases uh even the publicly available best

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,199
information we have from all the tooling might be and

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
for some reason ambiguous or or missing and so we have this curation process

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,680
that also come comes into it so there are people who

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,279
are able to make changes via our website or vr api

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,759
to the data that we have um those curation pr's are

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
literally uh pull requests on on github that

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
people create in the process of making these changes

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,919
and those are publicly available to the community and we have processes around

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,480
how curations are reviewed and then how they

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
are merged so the only people who are allowed to

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,039
merge uh curations are curators who are well

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,839
established in our communities you can think of them sort of like

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,280
any foss project maintainer so they're people who have established

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,120
a reputation as being uh knowledgeable in this

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,960
um but it's not just that they are allowed to just merge a pr as soon as it

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
is available and prs that have to also be reviewed by the

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
curation community who are a group of like-minded folks who understand

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
uh how these how these um how this data works and

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,799
and how the curation process works and more generally and they review the pr's

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,799
you can never review your own pr and you can never merge your own pr so it has to

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,000
be reviewed by by someone else and someone else has to validate that yes

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,200
they believe that this curation is in fact a equality curation this is a

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,919
factual change to the the project in some way that makes sense

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,760
um and then if the pr is merged that information is then augmented onto the

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
data for clearly defined um and as i as i mentioned we also

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
intend for these prs to then be contributed upstream in a way that makes

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
sense with the community that we are working with

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,640
upstream but we generally believe that if these are indeed uh the proper

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
changes these are these are the right changes to these

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,840
foss projects that they should be contributed back upstream we don't

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
simply want to be maintaining a larger and larger

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
database of changes that are maybe correct but are not actually

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,559
reflected in the upstream project we want the upstream projects to in future

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,480
versions be more clearly defined and for the ecosystem as a whole uh to

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
be to have more to have higher quality data about about

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,440
their projects um and just a couple minutes on on a few

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
other things so first of all this reaches farther than just clearly

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
defined in this license information we also have a concept of scoring so

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
how clearly defined any given project is and we intend

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,240
to try to to work to as i said over time have ecosystems be

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
more clearly defined for example if you're if you say that your license

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,320
is mit do we see the mit license somewhere in your project this is

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
uh one of the components of how your project is

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,600
is scored um and this get this can give consumers better confidence we also

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,720
think that there are other places that clearly define may be able to go in the

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,240
future we are focused right now just on license data but in the future we think

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
that it might be interesting to provide

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,919
security information accessibility information localization information

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,240
about about these projects we're interested more more broadly in

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
facts about foss projects that can be conveyed

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
through through their metadata and right now we are focused on on

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,400
license information but in the future we hope to focus on other things and you

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,880
can help clearly defined uh there are lots

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,480
of things you can do first of all you can go to the website right now

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,159
clearlydefined.io or you can go to our github which is

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,039
github.com slash clearlydefined and please use the data we have apis

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,159
available uh for you to use the data and we want

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,799
you to contribute to it as well in the cases where

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,480
uh you see a problem please do curations you can do a curation right now

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
on your favorite foss project at clearlydefined.io if you see

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,919
something that's that's missing or ambiguous you can make a contribution

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,919
right now and please donate to the osi you can

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,880
make a charitable donation to osi right now and

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
you can have it be for clearly defined if you

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,960
would like to see us in the future do more work in this space

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,799
and you can make your project more clearly defined so please make it

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,960
available the information like the license source location and copyright

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,360
information about your project in a clear way and please make sure that

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,679
you are are clearly defined uh in in your in the rest of your

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,320
uh projects ecosystem um and please join our community as well

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,440
we'd love to have you help us drive policies process and direction

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,760
so with that i will finish it up you can email me at carols at

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,159
microsoft.com i'm at fossygrl without an I on twitter and you can find

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,200
clearly defined @clearlydefd and i will take questions now so thank you very

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
much

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,080
ah so question is uh i'm a repo maintainer and your bot starts sniffing

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,240
and analyzing my repo does that activity necessarily notify me uh no we

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
don't do any uh any sniffing or analyzing of your

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
repo so um we pull down packages from the

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,080
package managers directly and uh and then we do all of our work in our

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
own uh cloud infrastructure uh so it will not affect you at all uh

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,120
we do have our own sort of um processes uh with github and and how

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,720
we do uh source location um and uh

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
and get and we examine your git history but uh

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,799
no it will not affect you at all uh you probably won't notice if we're

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,159
uh if we're analyzing you um probably the better

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,600
uh the more if you're interested in clearly defined and seeing if you're

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,960
clearly defined is to go to our website and to actually

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,440
check for your package um so you'd look for for whatever your

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
uh your thing is and see if we have a license a source location and a

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,039
copyright for for your whatever component you're

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,559
maintaining or project you're maintaining

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,480
uh question is have you seen any problems with older code or dead authors

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,240
and trying to ascertain the license um so uh i don't think we've

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
we see things specifically with older code or dead authors

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
so we don't have a lot of um analysis that tells us

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,840
why something isn't uh clearly licensed or why the license is ambiguous we

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,640
simply see the result that it is um it is unclear or it is ambiguously

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
licensed um kind of at the at the end of the process

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,760
and so then we we uh go and we do the curation to to

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,559
fix it up uh but a lot of the the why is sometimes

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,320
uh can be unclear to us uh actually as well since uh we're kind

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,840
of doing the same thing that the public does which is if the public is uh

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,159
if it's available on a on a public package manager um and

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,480
somebody sees that it doesn't have a license we see that it doesn't have a

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,880
license but we don't know specifically why

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
what is the next big thing clearly defined needs to add uh

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,760
so one of the the most common requests we get from our users is we've

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,279
got lots of folks who are using our public api right now which is great

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,559
uh folks who are just using the data in their uh their

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,159
sort of day-to-day processes and their organizations but

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
a lot of folks for one reason or another for security reasons or because they

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,440
don't want to take a dependency on a public service

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
would really like to be able to have a mirror of the data so they'd like

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,640
to have their own their own copy of the data or their own

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,600
version of the service that they're running internally to their organization

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,480
or internally uh to their project so that they they

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,159
have the data um when they when they need it and they

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,960
only are running it on their own infrastructure and so

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
that's definitely a high priority um solution that we'd like to

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,840
offer our users next uh beyond just the the public api and the way that it's

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
it's working now i'd say that's that's probably our highest priority

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,880
addition right now please go and check for your your own

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,480
packages your own projects on clearly defined let us know if you don't

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,679
find your own uh would be great for us to know that

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,840
and use our data

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,279
uh questions so question is besides curation what's the biggest opportunity

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,919
for someone to get involved as a contributor

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,360
uh there's uh lots of ways so we do have a

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
discord channel and a bi-weekly meeting that we're running right now so

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
you can lurk in our discord and or attend the meetings uh and

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,600
and contribute to the discussion and to um our our roadmap and the things that

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
we're we're talking about and thinking about uh that that is

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,880
a huge that would be a huge contribution in and of itself um if you are

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
interested in helping uh clearly defined the project itself so

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,799
improving you know fixing bugs and and adding features um we are an open

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,559
source project that uh like like many is is looking for uh

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,320
developers and folks who want to want to help us uh with development and write

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,919
code so uh it's in node and react uh i don't

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,039
know if that uh persuades you or intimidates you but uh

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,159
that your we would love uh patches and pull

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,960
requests to uh the project itself um and then uh

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,440
it is actually uh it is actually a contribution to use our data um

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,240
we have uh 10 million packages right now that we've we've scanned across

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,320
about 11 different uh package ecosystems uh but we don't know what we don't know

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,039
and so there's going to be lots of places where we still don't have

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,480
coverage are we still uh ecosystems that we still don't uh

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,200
know a lot about or have a lot of packages from and

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,760
uh you asking about it and and asking for for data about packages in different

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,520
ecosystems in different places uh is absolutely a good way to to

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,000
contribute to let us know that there's there's interest in this ecosystem or in

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
this kind of package in jquery of this variety or

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,740
