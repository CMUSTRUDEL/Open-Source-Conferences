Description: 
	Treating the OSS Commons like a Commons: Thoughts on a Post-Open Source World
Don Goodman-Wilson

The OSS commons is different from physical commons, in that software is not a limited resource that can be depleted. This distinction led us to reject explicit restrictions on participation and access. But there is in fact a limited resource at stake: Maintainers’ and contributors’ time and energy. A lack of regulation on access has created an unhealthy commons that doesn’t serve the intended purpose. But what would a set of regulations on OSS look like? History has lessons we can learn from.

open source has always been a grassroots movement for freedom but

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,840
moneyed and powerful interests have taken advantage of the structure of open

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,080
source and transformed it into a tool for

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,320
maintaining the status quo that favors the already powerful

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
open source has done a lot of good but the laissez-faire libertarian

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
approach to structuring our community and our mission has left us in a place

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,720
where it's an effective tool for removing freedom

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,000
progressing the ideal of freedom now requires a radical change to the way

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
that we do open source starting with the metaphors and

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,040
foundational assumptions that guide our thinking

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,239
we need to think long and hard as participants in open source

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,719
about the ways that our work is being used to curtail the freedom of others

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
i want to inject a focus on ethics into the conversation

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
ethics contrary to what you might be thinking isn't a search for absolute

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,280
rules of right and wrong ethics is a search for an answer to the

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
question how should we get along with other people

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
we are not alone in the world and behaving as though we are is no longer

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
an option open source is now actively contributing

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,960
to injustice in the wider world and we need to own that fact to take

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
action to preserve what is good about open source

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,119
while at the same time reducing the harm we create because as i will show

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,080
we are creating a great deal of harm the root of the problem as i see it is

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
this open source has explicitly rejected regulating

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
access to the pool of open source software

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
while turning a blind eye to the extensive system of invisible

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,520
implicit yet very real regulations that are woven through the structure of the

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,720
community this total abdication of control is toxic

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
pushing out people we need and opening the door to those that we don't want

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
the major feelings of open source can be

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,840
explained by a combination of the existing implicit covert

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
regulations governing the open source community at

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
large or lack thereof origins of this attitude lie in the

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,399
metaphor of the pool of open sources of commons

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
in particular the prevailing attitude is that this pool of software is an

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,240
abundant good that cannot be exhausted and that

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,119
therefore is a special kind of comments i want to reflect on this metaphor of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,560
the commons what intellectual and cultural work it is doing for us

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
and whether it can do work that we need it to because metaphors are tools

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
and like any tool when it is useful we should keep using it

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
but if it ceases to be useful we should find another tool another metaphor

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,879
and if you haven't guessed it yet i think the metaphor of the commons

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,879
as it is typically deployed is no longer doing useful work for the open source

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,599
movement first let's examine what a

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,720
non-metaphorical commons is and then how we usually deploy the

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
metaphor of the commons as applies to software

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
a commons broadly speaking is a shared public

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
limited resource ocean fisheries commercially important forests and

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
at least historically grazing land are all examples of such commons

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
that we're familiar with these are called commons because the fish

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
the trees and the grass are all somehow public or held in common by many people

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,319
they don't belong to any single entity notice also that in each of these cases

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,319
what is held in common is a limited though often renewable resource

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,319
thus management is a necessary component of such commons to ensure that the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
common resources are exist in a sustainable way

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
that fish are not overfished or trees depleted faster than they are planted

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
it is this aspect of commons that makes them interesting how do you identify the

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
stakeholders ensure their interests are fairly

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,080
represented and reach a consensus among likely competing interests while holding

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
the commons in a sustainable manner often the stakeholders are not just the

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
fishers and lumberjacks or their employers or contractors

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
forests on public land for example provide recreational opportunities for

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
everyone play an important role in larger

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
ecosystems host to for example endangered species providing

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,280
clean air thus overharvesting lumber isn't just a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
myopically poor decision from lumber mills

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,480
it has additional consequences far beyond the production of wood

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
a failure to manage well a common resource leads to what is called the

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
tragedy of the commons there is an inherent tension between the

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,319
collective interest and sustaining a commons

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
and individual interests to take as full advantage of the common resources

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
possible when governance fails to properly

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,919
incentivize limiting access individual actors will out of

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,759
self-interest each tend towards excessive access of the resource

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
for example consider grazing lands shared by multiple shepherds

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
each shepard has allocated a specific number of sheep that can be given access

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
to the land one shepherd may think to themselves

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,199
it's a small thing if i add just one more sheep to my flock

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
no one will notice and the additional impact on the land is marginal

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
yet if one shepherd is thinking this likely all are and the addition of

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
several dozen sheep is likely not at all marginal and the grazing land will soon

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
be valueless we often talk about the pool of open

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
source software as a commons the largest commons in the world it's a

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
resource owned by no single individual available for anyone with a computer to

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,360
access but as i mentioned the open source

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
commons is special you can't use up software just by copying it

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,080
you can make as many copies of the linux kernel as you like and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,600
although you have to find some place to store it your copying in no way impacts

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
my ability to do the same we can each sneak infinitely many

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
additional sheep into the grazing land with absolutely no consequences

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,880
because software isn't a physical thing it's infinitely and trivially

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,880
sustainable a tragedy of the commons is literally impossible because the tragedy

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
of the commons is impossible there is no need to set up a system of

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,160
governance to sustain the commons and indeed we have as a community

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
explicitly rejected any such notion by adopting a principle called

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
software freedom this principle of software freedom

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
states that anyone is welcome to copy software out of the commons without

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
restriction for any purpose it's an explicit injunction against

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
governance or regulation and it is only possible because of that

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,720
unique feature that software is infinitely abundant

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
in the past we saw a reason to celebrate the possibility of an unencumbered

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
commons because it was liberating empowering software freedom was a

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,919
powerful tool for fighting against authoritarian organizations like ibm

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,000
at t microsoft the us government even we have a lovely pejorative term for

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,080
when someone proposes restrictions on access to the commons we call that

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,039
encumbering the commons an encumbered commons

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
is no commons at all either we all have access or none do

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
indeed avoiding encumbrance has become an ethical concern

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
because the commons is unlimited it is wrong for anyone to restrict access

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
but the disconnect between physical commons and software comments should be

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,720
obvious the defining feature of a commons is its

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,360
limited nature the possibility of tragedy

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
the need for regulation and governance but open source software lacks this

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,919
feature where the principle of software freedom

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,720
licenses moral claims against restricting access

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,800
in physical commons it is the opposite that is true over accessing physical

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
commons is wrong what work is this metaphor doing for us

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,160
really it's hard to see the principle of software freedom has

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
led us to a place where we openly tolerate unethical use of open source

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,880
software as a necessary cost for the freedoms of

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
developers as the open source initiatives fact

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
tells us giving everyone freedom means giving evil people freedom too but

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,960
why is that that's a deeply unusual claim so let's

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,919
look at a few cases where we have given evil people freedom

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,759
and really dig into what that means let's talk about ICE

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,280
let's talk about deep fakes and let's talk about the exploitation

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,039
of underpaid labor each of these examples are going to highlight a

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
different way in which our current model of open

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
source is broken

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,599
case one: ICE in 2018 alone 49 100

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
immigrant children were arrested by the united states immigration and customs

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
enforcement or ICE and held in custody under the

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,680
unaccompanied alien children program through 2019 many of these children were

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
separated from their parents denied soap and other basic sanitary

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,440
items and in some cases were told they had to eat off the floor

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
this is only the start ICE has been repeatedly accused of

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,199
violating immigrants human rights exposing detainees to COVID 19 through

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
neglect illegally violating the privacy of

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
american citizens and most recently armed ICE agents were

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,720
deployed as an illegal paramilitary force in portland oregon

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,240
chicago and possibly other cities as a show of force by the trump

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,919
administration against the black lives matter protests

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,560
ICE are trump's shock troops sent out to

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,159
terrorize his enemies and oppress those he believes are a threat

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
ICE is a force opposed to the principles of freedom and liberty

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
of course none of this would be possible without the software that powers ICE's

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,800
operations software provided by palantir microsoft

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
github and others and much of which depends in

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
turn on open source

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
palantir provides big data analytics for government agencies across the globe and

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
currently has a 49 million dollar contract with ICE

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
at the moment palantir has 191 repositories on github

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,360
almost these appear to be focused on boring run-of-the-mill tech

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
infrastructure and don't appear to have accepted large-scale contributions from

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,760
the outside all of them contribute to palantir's

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
ability to provide surveillance services to their clients

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
but one stands out atlas db a high performance

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,160
transactional key value store appears to have a community

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
and following and it's no surprise such tools are in high demand for scaling

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
startups but it's also most likely a key part of

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,839
ice's quote mission critical investigative case management system

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
used to document track and deport undocumented immigrants in

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
the united states such as the children they rounded out

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
and separated from their parents in 2018 onwards

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
github provides ICE with the hosted enterprise version of their product

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,279
github enterprise or ghe which ICE uses as you'd expect for

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
in-house software development specifically by the enforcement and

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
removal operations division the division implicated and human rights

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,040
violations described earlier ghe is in turn powered by ruby on rails

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,760
a well-known and widely popular open source web application framework

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,360
most of the maintainers and contributors of open source software that ICE depends

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
upon for its operations probably have no idea that their code

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,200
has played some small role in visiting atrocities upon children and others

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
i want to point out that i am not calling those who contribute to ruby on

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,160
rails in any way blameworthy for their actions they aren't but they should be

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,320
angry to see their work used in this way and many maintainers are in fact rightly

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
pissed daniel hanemeyer hansen the creator of

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,640
ruby on rails has expressed dismay of this turn of events and

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,760
called this contract quote a stain on github

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,800
that'll be hard to wash out an open letter to github published in 2019 and

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,040
signed by hundreds of open source maintainers

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
lambasted github's role in enabling these atrocities

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,880
from the letter i quote at the core of the open source ethos is the idea of

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
liberty open source is about inverting power

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,440
structures and creating access and opportunities for everyone

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,279
we the undersigned cannot see how to reconcile our ethics

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,880
with github's continued support of ICE moreover

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,079
github's lack of transparency around the ethical standards they use for

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,200
conducting business is also concerning to a community that

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,399
is focused around doing everything out in the open

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
we want to know that the platform we've invested so much of our time and energy

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
in is operating in a way that is consistent

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,440
with the values of open source software development

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
yet in many ways github's behavior is entirely consistent with the principle

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,360
of software freedom but it is not consistent with the ideals

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
that drive open source how should we resolve this tension

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
between a desire and belief that open source software can be a tool for

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,480
justice and freedom and against oppression

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,279
with the fundamental belief that we should not interfere with anyone's

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,320
ability to use open source software for any purpose whatsoever

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,240
case two: deep fakes already the inundation of fake news is

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,480
causing a political crisis democracy relies at its foundations on a

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
well-informed voting public fake news and other sources of

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,480
disinformation chip away at this foundation

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
by instilling false or dangerous beliefs in voters who then make ill-informed

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,519
decisions about who should represent them in government

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,720
the increase in fake news is a threat to freedom and liberty

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
across the globe deep fakes if you aren't aware are a particularly

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,040
troubling new kind of video in which people usually famous are made

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,639
to say or do things they did not actually say or do

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
at the moment we rely heavily on video footage whether shot by professional

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,160
organizations or increasingly by amateur individuals to

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,200
sort fake news from real and to discover breaking news that

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
requires proper coverage and investigation

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
deep fakes dramatically exacerbate the fake news problem by providing dishonest

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
actors the ability to support fake news articles with convincing video evidence

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
for example of a political leader making a claim they did not actually make

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
deep fakes are a very real threat to democracy and the free flow of

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,760
politically relevant information

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,040
just a few years ago assembling a convincing deep fake

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
was tedious and time consuming this time leg is important

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,320
because in order to effectively support a fake news campaign

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
the footage must be produced in a timely manner because the window for

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,120
successfully co-opting a news narrative is quite short

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,200
in 2020 however things have changed a bit avatarify

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
is an open source software tool that allows the user to impersonate other

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,839
people live in a zoom video conference given

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,760
only a photograph of them it allows people in other words to

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,240
create shockingly convincing deep fakes and to do it in real time

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
this real-time ability serves to radically increase the effectiveness of

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
fake news campaigns to even create live news feeds of fake

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
news avatarify was clearly built as a joke

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,240
there's certainly no harm in populating the commons with the occasional joke

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,760
but the consequences are far-reaching because of course anyone can take this

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
code and build upon it and use it for any purpose whatsoever

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,720
anyone here includes not just jokesters but authoritarian organizations state

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,959
actors terrorist organizations and media

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,480
outlets intent on disinformation campaigns is a tool for deceit and

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
oppression again the act of releasing the software

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,760
into the wild is entirely consistent with the principle of software freedom

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
but it is not consistent with the ideals that drive open source

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,279
again we must ask how we can resolve the tension between the idea

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
that open source can be a tool for freedom and against depression

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,760
against the fundamental belief that we should not interfere with anyone's

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,120
ability to use open source software for any purpose whatsoever

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
even curtailing the freedom of others

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,000
case three extractive practices

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
there is a persistent idea among open source proponents

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,399
that software freedom is good because it levels the playing field

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,480
through equal access to the commons the idea of level playing fields is

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,959
sufficient for equity has always been a bit of a libertarian utopian fantasy

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,959
the reality is quite different it is true that you and i benefit from access

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
to the commons to a particular degree but large companies derive massive value

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,040
from open source on a scale far out of proportion to their size

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
you and i can access that commons for free with no string attached which is

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,160
great because perhaps we don't have the

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,360
resources to pay for high quality professional software

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,880
i certainly didn't when i began my linux journey in high school

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,920
but the same mechanisms that give us free as in beer

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,560
access to open source exist for large well-funded corporations as well

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
despite having plenty of resources to help fund open source

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,079
there is no explicit motivation for them to reciprocate

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,519
some do give back don't get me wrong but it's instructive to examine the

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,240
incentives for that behavior which we'll do in a bit the key is that

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
open source as marketed by the open source

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,199
initiative is literally about exploiting unpaid labor long touted is

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,880
one of the key benefits of open source businesses can reduce their cost by

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,120
outsourcing development to teams of unpaid labor this idea was a huge part

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
of eric raymond and bruce perrin's founding of the osi

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,639
to make open source palatable to business

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,240
but where in the late 1990s this idea was couched as cost sharing

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,839
the idea being that companies can share resources with each other to develop

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,120
open solutions the reality in 2020 is better described

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
as companies outsourcing their development to free labor to realize

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,079
significant cost savings a practice at many called

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,880
extractive at oscon 2019 amazon's vp of cloud

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
architecture strategy adrian cockcroft reinforced this view

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,720
and took it further quote so now that open source business

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
is using the developer community as a force multiplier for engineering

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,519
it means they don't have to invest as much in engineering as if they were

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,320
doing 100 of this themselves because the community

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,880
is actually doing some of their engineering for them

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,320
and then you take the enthusiasm of those people and you use that to create

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
market awareness and you invest in that market so you

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,640
know you've got your marketing you're using open source to magnify your

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,839
effect in the marketing side i imagine your reaction to this quote is

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,160
something like so what the fact that we read this quote and see

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,400
nothing wrong with what's being said is very telling in fact this quote is

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,120
terrifying it's an announcement that not only is

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,799
using unpaid labor to build large-scale commercial enterprises acceptable

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,880
it's something we ought to be doing adrian is trying to convince us that

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
this is normal it's anything but no other commercial

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,160
enterprise in the world operates this way

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
but what about those maintainers doing the free labor they are feeling

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,640
unempowered to improve the situation at maintainer audi 2019 in berlin we

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,919
learned that maintainers face an uphill battle convincing companies

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,760
that depend upon their project to provide funding most maintainers

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
don't even know where to start the process

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
who to talk to how to pitch let alone how to manage their finances

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
they feel exploited it shouldn't be the responsibility of maintainers to chase

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,960
down funding from organizations leveraging their work for profit

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,880
and when maintainers do succeed they're rarely able to afford to pay even one

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
full-time engineer once operating costs are covered

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
business realizes enormous value from open source

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
but maintainers do not share in the value they helped create

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,799
they deserve to this isn't some weird marxist ideology

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,400
but a fundamental tenet of capitalism those who take the risks

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,280
deserve to reap the rewards right now open source encourages businesses to

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,480
shift the risks onto maintainers while encouraging them to keep the

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
rewards for themselves not only is this a deeply unjust

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,679
situation it's unsustainable and will soon have significant

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,240
consequences beyond the individuals involved

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,280
all it takes is one person maintaining a key dependency

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,679
giving up and opening the door to a malicious actor

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
open source has become a tool of injustice open source empowers those who

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
would oppress makes it easier to take away the

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,960
freedoms of those at the bottom most rungs of society

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,840
and feeds power to the already powerful i want to be absolutely clear this is a

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,919
problem we can change this but it means

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,720
grappling with some very difficult deep-rooted issues in the very

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,760
foundations of open source so i want to ask how did we get here

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,240
despite the fact that the principle of software freedom

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,880
rejects explicit governance over how the unlimited software commons is successful

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,080
there's nevertheless an implicit set of regulations that governs people's

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,679
behaviors in the form of invisible yet nevertheless very strong and very

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
real incentives that ensure that maintainers

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,760
contributors and users will behave in certain predictable ways

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,200
let's look at some of these incentives and see if they can help us diagnose the

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,200
problem incentive one scratching an itch

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
far and away the most powerful motivator for getting involved and contributing to

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,000
open source is scratching your own itch a fine case in point

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,760
luna is a web application framework in c++

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,000
that i authored several years back i was employed to work on a project that

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,159
used lib micro httpd directly for serving up content over

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,640
http from inside of an app written in c if

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,720
you've never used libmicro httpd it's a fine library for adding a

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,400
lightweight http server to an app but its api is

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,200
notoriously difficult to use correctly so i wrote an easier to use abstraction

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,440
in c++ that i called luna the project manager ultimately decided

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,000
to re-author our product and go so i was free to release

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,240
my library to the wild i'm certain i'm the only person who uses it and that's

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,880
fine because the only reason it was ever written

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,280
was because i had an immediate need a need shared by apparently no one else

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
a brief glimpse at github reveals that i'm far from alone there are a lot of

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,400
people in the same situation and that's fine as far as it goes but

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
when personal need is the single largest motivator

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
to build open source software we should hardly be surprised when the vast

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,280
majority of it is developer tools mostly abandoned

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,720
this is not exactly a rich pool of software for the good of everyone

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
but the state of affairs has broader reaching consequences that i'll touch on

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,400
in a moment

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,240
incentive 2 reputation buff the second most powerful motivator for

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,039
getting involved in open source is the potential to buff your own

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
reputation as it happens i don't really work very hard to

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,200
mitigate code rot and luna there's no incentive

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
i'm not using it so no itch to scratch no one else is using it

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,799
but suppose one of you listening to this talk decides might be useful for your

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,840
own project and left an issue reporting a bug well

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,640
i'd like that someone's using my code attention who

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,679
doesn't love attention and yes i'll fix your bug because i want

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,080
you to like me and use my code at some point if we imagine more and

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,520
more people beginning to use luna i could develop a reputation as

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,280
the luna guy and i can leverage that reputation i can use it to get a better

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,159
job possibly even to work on luna itself it

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,600
opens the door to giving talks prestigious tech conferences if it gets

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,320
big enough eventually people might start developing courses

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,880
getting started with web apps using luna it might even start making the tech news

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,000
hey maybe there's a startup idea in here too low sweet vc funding

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,440
it's this kind of reputation buff that keeps people in open source

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,600
even when it works against their best interests the promise of money and fame

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,559
even if distant can be a powerful elixir but we should think about also who's

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,840
giving the reputation buff because of course i'm going to tailor my work to

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,039
those who think i will bestow those good feelings on me

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,039
abstractly it is the users and beneficiaries of the software i create

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
which in practice because i'm a developer scratching my own niche

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
really just means other developers so it's my own benefit

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,039
to focus almost exclusively on developer tools because that's the most efficient

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,400
way to build my reputation

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,480
incentive 3 adoption rate as primary success metric

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
there's one additional incentive to examine but i think that it derives at

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,600
least partially from the previous two and that's adoption rate as a primary

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,880
metric of project success whether it's measured in package

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,760
downloads github stars or number of talks

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
adoption rate is how we separate the wheat from the chaff we can see the

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
fingerprints of the incentive structure just discussed on this metric

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
projects with high adoption rates are the most likely to increase the

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,880
reputation of their maintainers and developer tools born of individual

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
needs are the most likely to be widely adopted

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,080
setting aside the deeply problematic assumptions of meritocracy that underlie

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
this feeling i think it's important to understand why

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,240
this metric is felt is so important this metric provides a normative

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,679
component to software freedom the principle of software freedom tells

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,159
us that open source software should be available to all adoption rate

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,279
tells us that we as individuals are succeeding when

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,279
people take advantage of that availability

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,919
and failing when people reject it adoption rate helps shape the kinds of

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
software that are contributed to helping ensure that the pool of open

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
source software is mostly developer tools

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
it also encourages overlooking morally dodgy circumstances

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,279
because adoption is viewed as unconditionally good it doesn't matter

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,279
who is adopting it except of course that it does when the

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,400
cloud native computing foundation announced on twitter earlier this year

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
that the united states air force was adopting kubernetes for its flight of

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,520
f-16 warplanes the arp war on twitter was loud enough

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,760
that cncf deleted their tweet at a talk i gave earlier this year to an

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,279
audience of typescript developers i discussed how typescript was used to

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,640
develop us air force recruiting website for drone pilots

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,679
the dismay among the audience was palpable

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
look i don't mean to pick on the air force it just happens to be topical but

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
if raw adoption rate really was viewed as a metric of success

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,960
you'd have expected cheers in both cases that's not what happened

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,159
there's a lot of anger hand-wringing and disappointment

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,840
consider how you might feel learning that your project was adopted by ice

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,720
versus learning that it was adopted by unicef it feels different doesn't it

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
that action is worth paying attention to because it tells us something

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,080
it's also said software is not a commodity that its creators feel some

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,600
sense of ownership over their creations and that thinking about the pool of open

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
source software as an inexhaustible commons

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,760
that should be readily available to everyone for any purpose is clearly not

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,919
getting us where we want to be as a developer these

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
incentives work well in my favor i build a new developer tool because i

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,279
have a need for one i release it into the public

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,880
another developer see it use it contribute to it building my reputation

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
within the developer community and adoption of my project goes up it's

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
a positive reinforcement cycle not just for me individually but for the

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,799
community the rewards of reputation bring more

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,320
people into the developer community and encourage more people to build developer

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,120
tools but we can see the results of this kind

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
of structure very clearly when we reflect on that well-worn joke about the

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,240
javascript framework of the week such frameworks pop up with far more

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,320
frequency than is necessary there's nothing wrong with last week's framework

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,600
but the structure we just discussed creates very strong incentives for the

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
creation of yet another framework because successful

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
web frameworks have a particularly strong reputation lift for their

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,440
maintainers this is not a particularly useful or

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
helpful place to end up indeed what we see here is that the

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,480
incentives i've identified ensure that software developers and tech

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,840
focused businesses and governments reap almost all of the benefits of open

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,080
source and discourage creating software or simply thinking about the software we

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,559
do create for the benefit of people outside of this relatively small circle

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,520
of beneficiaries

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,760
a diagnosis so the metaphor of an inexhaustible commons

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
and the principle of software freedom have led us to reject explicit

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,240
regulation of the pool of open source software

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,240
and the name of maximizing freedom but as i've shown

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,559
that rejection is really just an abdication of responsibility

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,679
there are despite this explicit injunction

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
structural implicit incentives and rules that actively work against the goal of

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,799
maximizing freedom let's connect the dots and show how

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,279
these incentives have created the deeply unjust world

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,240
i described earlier the primacy and normative value of adoption rate

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,520
metrics encourage maintainers to overlook who is using their software and

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
why what's important is that it is getting

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,159
used and the bigger the adopter the better

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
adoption rate only looks at the numbers and doesn't consider purpose because

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,399
software freedom and the almost laser-like focus on

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
increasing adoption rate combined with the reputation buff that naturally

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,600
arises from increased adoption strongly incentivizes maintainers to

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,080
overlook unjust uses the potential to increase my reputation

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,520
drives developers to release things that garner attention over things that are

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,080
useful such as yet another javascript framework

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,880
or very clever ai implementations cleverness is largely what gets rewarded

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,320
in the open source world the evidence is how little reputation

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
folks who devote themselves to maintaining functional software

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,799
get when i scratch my own niche it is almost certainly a result of my job

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,039
my own day-to-day hobbies don't involve internet infrastructure at scale

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,480
the tools that result are useful to my employer and are therefore more than

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
likely useful to other businesses as well

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,720
so my own internal motivations tend to grow the commons and a direction that is

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,600
more useful to large businesses than to let's say refugees combined with the

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
distinct lack of incentives for reciprocation

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
its scratching encourages large corporations to adopt my software

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,440
because the value realized is so very large compared to the zero cost

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,960
and now i'm maintaining a tool that brings me more stress than financial

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,200
rewards it makes tech founders rich open source

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,640
is broken it is not working as it was intended to

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,159
the incentives need to change the mental model we use to shape the way

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,080
we think about open source needs to change the time has long passed

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,799
that we need to start thinking proactively about the world we want to

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,760
bring about with open source and deliberately structuring our

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,679
community around this vision because what we've done so far as a

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
community is merely abdicate responsibility

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,240
enough so how do we move forward what does a post open source world look like

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,120
let's start by approaching open source from a different perspective

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,440
thinking of the pool of open source software as an inexhaustible comment has

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,799
gotten us into a lot of trouble and has done so by neglecting explicit

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,039
regulation of community behavior in favor of structural implicit regulations

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,360
as i've said before this way of thinking condones unjust outcomes

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,159
if we want to move past the state of affairs and find a new way forward that

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,559
both captures everything that is good about open

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,159
source while leading us away from a world where open source is a powerful

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,520
tool for creating injustice then we should begin by rethinking the

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,159
foundational metaphor we rely on talk of commons and commodities scarcity

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,520
and abundance hides so much of what is valuable about open source

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,399
the people and communities that create and share and benefit from open source

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,320
it also serves to hide the injustices that software freedom creates by

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,360
focusing exclusively on the freedom of software users

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,120
without reflecting on either software creators or the wider world of people

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,240
impacted by the software we create and use

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,200
so what if we didn't think about open source through the lens of scarce and

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,480
abundant resources what if instead we focused on the people

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
that lie at the heart of open source maintainers contributors adopters

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,279
commentators victims beneficiaries and the

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,120
relationships between them the problematic cases i discussed

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,480
earlier are all concerns about the ways in which members of the open source

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,720
community and those beyond who are nevertheless

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,159
impacted by open source treat each other and as i mentioned in

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
the beginning of this talk the study of ethics is fundamentally an

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,279
attempt to answer the question how should we get along with each other

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,399
getting along with others largely depends upon our ability to

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,320
treat others as humans this might sound trivial but it is

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
enormously important especially since it's pretty apparent

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
that many open source communities struggle mightily with this idea

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,559
i begin by observing that i am a human i have a capacity for

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,600
rational thought and free will that i have desires

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,840
needs and goals and that i'm entitled to a certain level of dignity and respect

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,080
and virtue of these facts i can infer that you are likewise human

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,880
and just like me you have a capacity for rational thought

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
and free will and that you have desires and needs and goals and that

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,480
therefore you are also entitled to a certain level of dignity and respect

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,760
and virtue of these facts if i'm worthy of respect

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,159
you are too because we're both human respecting someone in this context means

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,039
consciously recognizing another's fundamental humanness

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,240
treating them as we would want to be treated in their circumstances

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,919
and refusing to treat them as mere means to our own ends

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,600
it means taking others desires and needs into account when we are faced with a

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,679
decision and not just the route that's most

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,320
expedient for our own personal interests let's consider again the concerns i

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,519
raised earlier in my talk and think about them in the context of this way of

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,000
thinking

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,159
ice violates human rights has been doing so for years

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
standing on the principle of software freedom that we ought to remain neutral

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,600
about how our software is used is absolutely not an apolitical neutral

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,640
stance in fact giving these organizations equal

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,120
access is an expression of our willingness

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,600
to discount those they oppress as human unworthy of consideration

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,840
by remaining neutral we are in fact choosing to exclude not just such

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
victims but everyone outside of our immediate

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,679
community of developers is beneath consideration and therefore

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,360
is not human placing weapons into the pool of open

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,559
source software is equally troubling for the same reason

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,320
merely tolerating this behavior says that we value weapons more than we value

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,799
the people who might one day be the victim of those weapons

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,399
just because they're not part of the immediate community of developers

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,600
the implicit incentive structures i discussed earlier however mean that we

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,480
don't merely tolerate this behavior we encourage it and that's even worse

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,320
it is more important to us that we reward developers who build clever

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
weapons than to think about the consequences for

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,799
entire populations of at-risk people when we choose to ignore them we are not

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,600
offering them the dignity and respect that they are due as humans

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,120
the problem with extracting free labor from open source maintainers should be

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,760
obvious large organizations that leverage open

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
source for free labor are not treating maintainers with the respect they

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,919
deserve as humans respect demands that we reciprocate when

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,039
we ask someone to direct their labor for our own benefit

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,559
this is why we have laws against child labor and movements to eliminate

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,440
sweatshops indentured servitude and slavery from

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,159
our supply chains why do we treat the production of

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,840
softwares that were different it's not this is why these outcomes are unjust

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,000
because we are ignoring the needs desires and goals of people treating

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,840
them as an ends to justify to ourselves granting additional freedoms quote

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,120
unquote to other software developers but such thinking also points the way to

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,880
better outcomes recognizing our obligation to extend our

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
consideration beyond software users and businesses

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,760
means we have an obligation to actively change the incentive structures

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,720
we've allowed to form

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,240
open source is a community it's one thing to expect of yourself to behave in

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
a way that respects the people around you

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,760
is another to motivate a community to behave in ways that are consistent with

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,040
the principle of respect for others such as not using our software to

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,879
violate human rights such ethical behaviors are frequently at

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,560
odds with individual self-interest so we can't rely on a laissez-faire

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,040
system of implicit regulation to make that happen

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,560
we need an explicit thoughtful incentive structure

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,839
let's talk about the positive behaviors we want to incentivize

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,440
and the negative behaviors we want to dissuade this is going to vary from

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
community to community but i think we can come up with reasonably

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,919
generalized set first we must disincentivize adoption of

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,560
software by actors unwilling to commit to basic

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,280
principles of the value of human life ice and other oppressive authoritarian

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,720
organizations do not deserve free unimpeded access to

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,839
our work in the name of removing freedom open

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,680
source software must be unattractive and unwelcome to the powerful who

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,920
exploit it for unjust ends second we must disincentivize extractive

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,440
practices on maintainers the people who create

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
open source deserve to share in the tremendous value their effort creates

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,880
again open source software must be unattractive to the powerful

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,520
who benefit from it disproportionately third on the other hand we must

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,280
incentivize the creation of software with benefit outside of the developer

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,000
community especially the benefit of at-risk

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,960
populations too much software being produced is for

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,960
the benefit of developers and not enough is being produced for other demographics

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,839
the pool of open source software should reflect the needs of those without power

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,240
finally most importantly we must incentivize a focus on

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,680
outcomes and impact rather than raw adoption rates

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,520
raw adoption is a broken metric if our goal is to make the world a better place

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,160
through software then let's define what that better place

00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,839
looks like and the kinds of technology that can get us there and reward

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,359
developers who work towards those goals we have at least three levers at our

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:12,160
disposal for creating these incentives licenses money and cultural change

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,240
licenses like the hippocratic license license zero and the anti-capitalist

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
license place conditions on access to software

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,079
licensed with them the hippocratic license for example

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,160
requires that licensees not engage in human rights violations

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,760
such licenses catch a lot of flack from supporters of the open source initiative

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,040
because they do not adhere to the osi's open source definition

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,960
which requires that open source licenses not place conditions or restrictions on

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,200
use but in light of everything i just said i

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,200
believe these licenses and others like them deserve our attention

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,599
why because they might just represent a step towards a more thoughtful incentive

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,359
structure like the one i outlined a bank involved in human rights

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,040
violations in congo is unlikely to adopt software licensed

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,240
with the hippocratic license because doing so would expose the

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,119
company to more risk than they're willing to tolerate

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
in the past we'd have lamented the lawson adoption for this project

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,040
but in fact this is reason to celebrate the project has successfully imposed an

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
admittedly very small but nevertheless real

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
cost on the business in virtue of their poor treatment of congolese palm farm

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,760
workers such licenses also provide a positive

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,640
incentive businesses that have invested heavily in

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,920
infrastructure that depends upon hippocratic licensed software

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
may find they have reason to avoid entering into business deals that

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,280
involve human rights violations preventing unjust oppressive

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,599
organizations from using open source and encouraging otherwise unproblematic

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,200
organizations to avoid oppression is precisely the point

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,240
only then can we sleep while knowing that we have reduced the chance that our

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,119
labor is being used for evil license zero offers two different

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,560
licenses that work in slightly different ways but both of which are focused on

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,359
the idea of returning value to maintainers

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,640
the prosperity license for example prohibits the use of the license

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,240
software for commercial purposes without paying a fee

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,440
it is designed to prevent extractive use of the software

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,520
ensuring that a portion of any value realized is returned to the maintainer

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,599
preventing powerful organizations from extracting value without reciprocation

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,359
is precisely the point without explicit incentives

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,880
as we've seen maintainers rarely share and the value created by their labor

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,640
i call licenses that restrict access in ways that are aligned with treating

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,520
others with respect just licenses just licenses

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,280
are as the name suggests a tool for justice they're designed to help ensure

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,079
freedom very much in the spirit of open source

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,680
but it's still early days in our experimentation with just licensing

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,599
there's a lot of work to be done to figure out how to best make this work

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,640
and licensing although a powerful tool in our toolbox

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,240
is insufficient to achieve these just goals by itself

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,040
we must think bigger money and cultural change are both much harder and also

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,480
arguably more important in bringing about this kind of change

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,520
if we want to start normalizing ethical open source

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,800
we must start thinking about the kinds of institutions that need to be built to

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,400
create and support these incentives we do

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,599
already understand some ways at least in which we can get funding to projects

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,240
that need it but we haven't yet really seen

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,400
experimentation with using that funding as an incentive for software projects

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,480
to encourage them to behave in ways that are consistent with treating humans

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,760
as humans github sponsors tide lift and open collective or well-known efforts

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,520
but they place very few restrictions on the projects wanting to receive money

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,359
moreover schemes especially like github sponsors doesn't even address the real

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,400
crux of the problem because it is essentially a system for shuffling money

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,960
between maintainers it does nothing to create strong

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
incentives for consumers of open source to abandon extractive behavior

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,440
a small step in the right direction are foundations like the linux foundation

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,760
and the software freedom conservancy sponsorship of these organizations

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,200
are attractive because sponsors can earn marketing clout

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,880
such foundations work towards furthering the cause of open source promoting a

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,520
culture consistent with open source values

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,200
and the foundations are in a position to use that funding to offer vital services

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,800
to member projects as an incentive to join and perfect as

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,599
they are institutions such as these are vital to

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,480
the open source movement as it exists today

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,680
for this reason i think that associations or foundations are a

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,119
pivotal tool for propelling us into a post-open source world

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,720
to provide the incentive structure i discussed earlier and for promoting

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,880
an ethics-based culture in our community to help normalize the broader notions of

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,560
freedom that i've been discussing today it's worth looking at two such

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,400
institutions that already exist that could provide a model for us the

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,680
code for america network and the institutional review board

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,839
system at american research universities

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,119
code for america along with other members of the code for all network

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,720
is an intriguing model for what could be accomplished code for america

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,160
is an organization dedicated to leveraging technology to improve

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,319
democratic government in the united states software for them is a tool

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,599
their focus is squarely on the impact of their work indeed

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,960
nowhere on their website will you find mention of open source commons or

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,000
software freedom even though all of their code is in fact released under

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,839
open source licenses as a result member projects have strict

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,240
requirements the problems that they tackle are

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,680
decided on and a consensus-based way and are driven from the bottom up

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,440
rather than by developers whims to ensure that each project contributes to

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,079
a broader yet still concrete societal goal

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,280
member projects must also adhere to strict requirements on open and

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,560
democratic governance and adhere to and enforce a code of

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,800
conduct to ensure that their communities are inclusive and thriving

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,400
in this way code for america and other code for all affiliates

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
can help ensure that the software needs of people outside of the developer

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,640
community are being met that their membership isn't merely naval

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,839
gazing or worse yet developing weapons with foundation

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,920
resources they're providing some of the incentives we need to have a healthier

00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,200
open source community and to ensure that open source really is

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
creating freedom for those who don't have it

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,280
we can imagine other foundations that operate along these lines

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,480
they could create some of the incentives i discussed earlier by offering

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,680
resources to member projects on the condition that the projects behave

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,720
in ways that are consistent with the value of others as humans

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,640
by focusing the needs of others by prioritizing impact and outcome

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,599
we need more of this the scientific community has for some time

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,760
faced somewhat parallel ethical issues american research institutions that

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,880
receive funding from the federal government are required to demonstrate

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,319
that any research conducted on human subjects meets certain minimum ethical

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,200
criteria to fulfill this obligation each

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,000
institution has its own institutional review board

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,040
or irb the board's primary goal is the protection of human subjects well-being

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,560
and all experiments on human subjects require the irb's approval

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,880
using a common rubric the board is staffed by researchers on a rotating

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
basis to ensure that the board is not treating

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,000
researchers unfairly and the research is being reviewed by

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,359
competent peers each time a researcher wants to conduct

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,800
an experiment they must submit a plan to the irb for review

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,319
the irb has the authority to block the experiment if the submitted proposal

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,440
does not meet the minimum ethical requirements

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,280
but what about the incentives if an experiment continues without irb

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,000
approval or the irb is found upon audit to have

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
been negligent in its duties then the federal government has the

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,760
right to withdraw all research funding for the institution

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,000
a kind of academic death sentence this threat to all research creates a set of

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,839
beneficial incentives first and most obviously the threat of

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,800
having your funding pulled disincentivizes individuals against

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,640
trying to cheat the system second the thought of having all funding

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,839
pulled ensures alignment across the community

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,440
and prevents favoritism or prefer from treatment for specific

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,119
individuals thirdly it incentivizes community

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,920
vigilance against individuals attempting to cheat the system

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,319
so the community becomes self-regulating funding in this case is both a carrot

00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,800
and a stick it can be used to bring people into the

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,680
fold and it can be used to keep them there as well

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,680
irbs act as a kind of financially backed code of conduct but for communities

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,680
rather than individuals this provides additional incentives for the community

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,720
to ensure that the project remains focused on the right goals

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,480
and continues to participate in a consensus-based decision-making process

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,520
with its siblings open source creates a lot of good

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,359
but it is also enabling injustice in our world at multiple levels

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,800
and at large scale our metaphors are failing us

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,079
our principles are failing us and our institutions

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,440
are failing us we have a moral responsibility

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,880
as open source advocates to do better the pool of open source software is not

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,920
a commons and insofar as open source is primarily a force for freedom

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,280
thinking about it is such as dangerous if we really

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,640
truly believe that freedom is the ultimate goal of open source

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,319
then we need to drop this metaphor and re-examine what we are doing from an

00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,599
ethical perspective instead of a transactional one

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,720
we need new incentives and new regulations

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,319
more importantly we need new institutions to enact those incentives

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,200
and regulations and we all need to be contributing to a

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,200
culture of change instead of blindly upholding the status quo

00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,720
obviously we can't stop people from releasing tools of oppression under

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,720
permissive licenses obviously we can't stop people from just

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,160
doing whatever with code whose source is released into the wild

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,839
but the natural conclusion of these two facts is not that we can just shrug our

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,720
collective shoulders these facts do not permit us a total

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,280
abdication of responsibility that's just absurd instead the logical

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,160
conclusion is simply that we ought to do what we can

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,160
and there remains a lot that we can do we have a moral obligation

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,000
to investigate those paths to experiment and to discover what an ethical

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,839
just and sustainable community driven software development program can look

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,960
like so i call on you to reflect on the facts

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,400
i have presented to reflect on what freedom actually means to you and

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
whether your view has been too narrow i call on you to talk about this with

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,800
your friends your colleagues your community

00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,079
to create a culture that embraces the need for change

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,520
i call on you to help me reshape our institutions to create new ones that

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,040
support the goals of a new ethics-based open source

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,040
most importantly i call on you when you participate in open source

00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,119
to think carefully about the people and relationships your work impacts or could

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,720
be impacting we're not alone in this world far from

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,200
it going on so i really like this first

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,079
question that went up there how can maintainers and individual contributors

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,480
channel their anger about their code being used by evil

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,359
parties i like this question because i don't have an answer to it

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,680
um i think there is an answer to it um but i don't i don't know exactly what it

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,680
looks like but i'm very excited uh we need an organized

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,520
way of amplifying our voice to the extent that we are outraged

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,280
um right now it's been individuals uh posting twitter threads uh people like

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,520
seth vargo pulling software um and causing disruptions for

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,680
short periods of times a handful of people quitting their jobs

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,240
but it's just noise really that's getting lost um and

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,920
there's no way for us to take these individual actions and channel them

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,119
together uh into a bigger more powerful message

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,559
um and i would i would very much like to see something like that happen uh and

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,280
i'm very interested in having a conversation

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,480
with uh folks here about what we could do to

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,559
make this happen you know i'm not i'm not an activist organizer uh at my

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,240
core so i don't i don't understand the mechanisms for for how we can do

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,119
these things but but i think we need something

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,680
uh for sure um same with the second question what can

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,960
an individual employee do um in uh in big tech should i should i

00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,480
pause after answering these questions okay uh what can individual employees do

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,160
uh to make sure that their leadership team or their open source office

00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,839
uh supports their maintainers instead of just benefiting from it

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,839
um probably the best thing that you could do is as organize as employees

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,480
right as individual employees you don't have a whole lot of power

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,200
um relative to your employer and if they're not interested in funding the

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,720
open source that you rely on there's there's arguments that you can

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,960
make to persuade but but there's um those arguments have been made i

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,200
think there's not a whole lot new that can be

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,800
said there um and instead if you truly believe in it

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,440
then then finding some way to organize as employees as a union making that part

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,599
of your demands uh as a collective bargaining action is

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,440
probably going to be the most effective way to

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,720
make that kind of thing happen the other thing you can do is you can pull on your

00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,359
your customers in your supply chain right to

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:48,240
uh ensure that they're aware um of these kinds of injustices and to

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,200
have them apply pressure because they can bring money to the table

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,800
and money can can be a very effective uh tool for for

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,559
uh affecting change of course how do you define

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,880
bad actor or violates human rights so human rights is really straightforward

00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,280
the un has a definition of what human right is

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,480
and what a human rights violation looks like and they have a court

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,760
in Denhaag just down the road from where i live uh

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,640
that arbitrates uh human rights uh cases so there are well established

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,040
mechanisms for both defining and um litigating over these these kinds

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,200
of issues when you want to move beyond human

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,960
rights it becomes a little more uh a little more difficult and i don't

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,720
have a good answer for that yet but at least

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,839
the baseline like we have institutions we can rely on

00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,240
for that um there's going to be some some interesting stuff around the

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,359
hippocratic license which is founded on on the u.n definition of human rights

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,240
hopefully coming up soon that that can shed some light on that

00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,079
uh how do we move beyond haggling over terminology

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,800
or throwing definitions at each other as if that were genuine argument

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,000
boy we're engineers we love haggling over definitions

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,200
right that's a big part of our job is to get clear on

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,040
what our terms mean uh whether they apply in a particular case

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,160
and so on and so forth right we're very analytical about the language that we

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,400
use

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,520
as somebody mentioned in the uh in the public chat like culture change is a big

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,440
part of that right um

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,200
just not having a culture of haggling over these things

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,559
as a way of stalling argument not tolerating it when it happens

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,720
and encouraging people to have more thoughtful conversations including those

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
who are capable of having more thoughtful

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,760
conversations to shift the culture around the way that we discuss

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,520
problems there's going to be a key component

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,000
of putting it into that practice and making making forward motion

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
um again i don't i don't have the answers for everything here

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,280
but these are really really fun questions i love this

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
um bad actors are unlikely to care about license violations yeah that's

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,960
that's very true right um some legal entities will

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,280
um because they they are risk-averse uh and they don't want to to break a

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,079
contract but many entities like terrorist

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,040
organizations right they clearly don't care

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,680
and there's probably nothing we can do about that right uh directly

00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,359
that doesn't mean we don't have a responsibility to not

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,680
try right that's a i think a very important point is that

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,359
we nevertheless do have a responsibility to uh

00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,400
figure out what mechanisms we do have available to us

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,200
and to leverage those where we can um but a lot of that just is changing the

00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,119
incentives right i mean let's just not put weapons in the pool of open source

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,559
software and fewer weapons that are there the fewer

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,280
weapons that bad actors can draw upon for example

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,520
of course just to take the ruby on rails example again right

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,440
i don't know what to do about that how do we how do we keep

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,119
how do we keep bad actors from i'm trying to think of a good example where

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,000
something like ruby on rails would be used as a weapon but

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
we can we can pretend right there's probably not a lot of

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,119
not a lot of room there to make improvements but that

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,359
again it just doesn't mean that we don't have a responsibility and we can ignore

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,119
all of this it just needs we need to be more careful in the way that we think

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,640
about it um and betting don't like the idea of

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,040
embedding limitations in the licenses but making open source unattractive to

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,640
the ones who do evil is an interesting concept that could be done differently

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,119
any ideas on this for the most part right if we want to effect change um

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,119
in other organizations we only have a handful of levers at our disposal

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,800
the first is we can limit the supply of things that they can use

00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,720
to the extent that they're law abiding we can leverage legal frameworks

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,319
which is what we've done historically by leveraging copyright law

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,839
there may be other kinds of laws contract law trademark law

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,280
that we can we can leverage to our advantage uh

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,920
to create uh risk uh for law-abiding legal entities uh

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,839
to encourage them uh to change their behavior in certain ways

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,640
uh there's money uh clearly i mean we're open source developers we probably

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,599
don't have a lot of money collectively that we can throw at this problem

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,960
um and there's culture change uh which i think is

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,559
is probably uh

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:35,839
the most within our grasp um and i think that um

00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,359
creating a a culture of caring about these sorts

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,040
of things is going to lead us to produce software in a different way

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,880
to change the pool of software that's available right and then change the

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,000
dynamic of how people are are misusing what what we've built

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,500
but i don't have a i don't have a good answer to to a lot of this all i can do

00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,340
