Title: State of the Source 2020: The Next Generation of Contributors is not on IRC
Publication date: 2020-09-23

Description: 
	The Next Generation of Contributors is not on IRC
Matthew Broberg

There is some combination of a turf war and a diaspora happening in the open source communities when it comes to communication. Every platform has its fans and haters with firmly held opinions on how it's the best or worst thing in the world. That's fine for regular contributors, but what about new ones? What are our communities searching for when they hop into communication channels? How do we meet new members where they are? Let's talk about what that looks like in practice.

hey all i'm really glad you're able to make it

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,960
to my talk i'm excited about the state of the source

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
it's been the one conference i've been looking forward to during this

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,519
pandemic and i'm i'm so thrilled to talk to you

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
and how relevant we're going to talk about communication channels

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,880
how do we keep in touch with each other over this wild internet of ours

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,880
and how maybe irc isn't the right solution for us today

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,960
i say that not to create some sort of beef with anybody

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
but i just want us to get to think outside of our normal world view here

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,399
and i have some data to support this idea you can find the slides on speaker

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,160
deck so i'm matt i work as a technical editor

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,039
on opensource.com for red hat and there i get to coach and

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
encourage community members to write about their open source experiences

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,800
it's a really fascinating blend of everything from deep dives on

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
kubernetes to learning python to what's your first

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,600
experience with linux but it's telling technical stories and i

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
love coaching people through that i also joined the osi and the psf

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,040
the python software foundation and i'm a contributor to kubernetes through a

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
working group and a maintainer in the chaos community i also recently

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,119
graduated from a partial graduate program

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,560
called the business of open source out of brandeis that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
comes with an osi approval and guidance so it taught me

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
a lot more about the foundations of open source

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
and i've been learning that as a as i go here so it's been great to solidify that

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
through a course and i highly recommend you check it out

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,479
so to anchor us in this conversation take a moment and think

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
where were you and what tools were you using

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,799
to chat with the first open source community that you felt like you were a

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,320
member of that you felt included in okay with that

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
in the back of your head let's roll through history a little bit

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,079
so irc released in 1988 but i say by the early

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,000
90s it just seemed to take up the free space

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,759
of where are people going to talk about

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
open source online it wasn't quite as popular as it is

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,720
today open source that is but the conversation was happening there

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
if we fast forward another 10 years or so we land in the early

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
2000s where irc pretty strong following 240 000 people

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,879
are hanging out on there and there are just some behemoths though

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,959
competing for chat space you have icq which will ever

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,920
look for will forever live in my heart you

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,720
have msn messenger that had well over a hundred million users which

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,480
is just crazy and then yahoo was a beast of its own

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,599
time when i talked to irc enthusiasts they

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
always remind me that all of those channels have since

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,560
become deceased and in their mind in that headspace

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,080
it is only empty space around it there is only

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
irc but times have changed quite significantly

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,599
when we we take a look around us you see slack

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,159
with a whopping 44 million users which is just absolutely dominating many

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
of the communities i see and participate in getters involved with

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
100k an element formerly riot.im with its

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
matrix underlying protocol is an open source

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
alternative that's coming out pretty strong with 18 million users

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
just recently so it's great to see but even these

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,879
these don't even compare to some of the other networks that we

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,680
spend time on in our day we see twitter with over 300 million so

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
that's way bigger than msn messenger ever was

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,000
telegram is even bigger who knew i didn't and then reddit is

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
the beast that it is and even beyond those

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
discord very popular in the gaming community has an

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,640
increasingly open source-centric space and even has open source some of its

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,599
code and seems to intend to do more in that space

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,200
so there are a ton of channels that are available to us

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,560
and those are just the ones we want to talk about the one no one wants to talk

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,200
about is facebook with 2.6 billion users

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
allegedly i'd worry about how many of them

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,840
are bots just like the rest of us but putting that aside this isn't an

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
advertisement for using the largest channel by any means

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,000
but it is an acknowledgment of this question that we started with where

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
did you first come from when you engage with open source communities

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
my impression is that if you're a fan of irc

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,440
you started on irc maybe a mailing list as well but irc was that place where you

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,080
connected with people for the first time in the open source community

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,440
for me on the other hand github was the place that made me feel

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,840
welcome i didn't even know what i was doing would be considered open source

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
but i opened a pull request and shared information and

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,160
improved a project i absolutely adored before i really understood what i was

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
doing and not only that i got to banter with

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
people about it on twitter after which is my preferred chat platform and

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
in that way you the seasoned open source professional

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,639
see me the github generation of open source

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
as maybe a foreign species to some degree

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
you know the osd from heart can recite all the parts of it

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,000
and i only in the last year through that course figured out that fsf the free

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
software foundation and the open source initiative were

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,680
different sorry i know it's a big deal but it didn't it

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,600
i just didn't know it you have had to live through subversion

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,840
and other forms of version control while git has been a

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,199
common denominator for me throughout my whole career

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
and you've been active on irc this whole time i just joined because element made

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
it easy more on that later but what brings us

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
together as a collective community and what i

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
hope you will see in me and what i see in you is that we really

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
care about open source communities and we want each one of ours to grow and

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
succeed and to connect with users that need

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
it we don't make this just for the heck of it we make it to share

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,000
and to create that commons that can be cultivated communally

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,400
so when a new user and this is my experience firsthand

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,280
is using irc they look at it like what is this wizard-like syntax

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
you know having a cs degree and working in

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,759
technology and data centers for 10 years still didn't

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,880
prepare me to try to figure out how to chat on this platform

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
when i was so used to twitter where i was so used to github

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,440
and name server for godsakes just doesn't seem to respect me as a person

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,319
it will give away my username every time i try to log in from a different machine

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
so you know these may be naive questions and

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
you're watching this like hey i can fix this for you but that's not the point

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,360
it's the point is that the bar for a new user

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,240
is higher than ever and irc doesn't quite hit those points that are

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,639
just seen as basic by other standards so if we talk about

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
the sign up experience and having an account where i can configure it

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
that i can then sign into that account through my mobile device

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,000
or i have onboarding to figure out what the heck is the syntax of this new tool

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
because every new tool is a little different

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
to have moderation options that makes this safe for people

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,919
so that they can mute trolls or um or mute conversations that aren't good

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,240
for them aren't healthy for them is there a shared discussion history

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
just something out of the gate that yes i know there are extensions for irc

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
but out of the gate it is complex and confusing to find

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
and then multimedia support i i really like emojis i think it's one of the few

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,440
ways we can express ourselves through reasonably plain text these days and

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,319
without those it's you're really silencing a lot of

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
conversation so there's a lot of things including the

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
notifications that are also important because we're on so many different

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,120
channels and of so many different tools if i can't tune my notifications

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
i probably won't actually look when people are talking irc doesn't offer

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,560
these and slack and element absolutely do so

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
slack being the dominant proprietary option an element

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,000
formerly riot.im is just taking over as the great

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,479
alternative and that really it shows in the numbers

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,800
right so this is from a site that's been

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,640
tracking irc since its very beginning and the numbers as of 2020 are looking

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,279
pretty low compared to the high point in 2004 and that is

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,800
shrinking at a time when open source is more

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,399
popular than ever so the correlation of those two things

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
just doesn't bode well for irc as a as a primary communication

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
channel but i hear you i hear you screaming

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
through the microphone yes but irc has principles that i really

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
value you value an open source license you

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
value the decentralized nature so no one owns

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,279
owns it and you value end-to-end encryption that yes

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
most people layer on top of their irc config to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,240
to give them that independence and that sovereignty over their info

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,440
i totally get it but those are not enough to make irc the only

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
answer elements and rocket chat are fantastic

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,680
and if you ignore federated and you can get zulip in there pretty

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
quickly as well and they're all great chat apps

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
so just looking at rocket and element because they're my top two

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
in this category they all still meet the requirements

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,040
that irc cannot out of the box and and that really matters to users who

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
are used to a more full-fledged more more modern

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
experience so with all due respect irc is not the

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,560
right tool for new users so i can't tell you what's

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
right for you and the maintainers of the project but as a

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
new user as somebody who's trying to attract

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,000
somebody you have to accept that they are not going to jump in and know what

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,440
they're doing there so what does it look like

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
to choose a community channel we've been zoomed in

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
on one very specific part of a bigger challenge

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,600
and i want to offer a model to help you think through it

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,200
in the future when designing a community experience i break it into four

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,480
quadrants that there's synchronous communication

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
where there's a casual conversation going on

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
that really keeps the buzz going keeps people communicating over time

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,279
when you have on the other hand you have asynchronous communication

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,600
which gives you the definitive record of truth it's your question and answer type

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
forums it's your asynchronous way in which you

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,440
can it's a mailing list by default is is very common but there are other tools

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
that are available these days in face to face it brings us together

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
and it creates those bonds that last lifetimes and then people do need news

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,880
outlets which we end up filling accidentally

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
but if you map out communities you'll see they consistently have a channel in

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,959
which you can find the authoritative truth of

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,200
what's going on so we're only zoomed in on synchronous

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,480
which includes a set of technologies that differ from

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
these other ones so we're only talking about one fourth

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,760
of this challenge and it gets more complicated with time

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
but i show this all to say that all

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,120
communities are multi-channel and all communities have a bunch of tools

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,000
so looking at synchronous yes it is helpful for us to start here because

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
it's what everyone is used to but i just want to note that

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
it's rarely the right place for a community to start

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,720
if you're starting from scratch think about asynchronous communication

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
think about how you're going to be able to break people out of these limitations

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,760
that are inherent to synchronous uh how they require always-on

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,880
participation and how it creates a culture of

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
immediacy for everybody and it automatically

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,760
makes it more difficult for people outside of a time zone to participate

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
probably my least favorite part of synchronous communication

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,760
is that great knowledge is given and lost every single day

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,519
if i give an answer on how to set up a environment for testing and somebody

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,360
else shows up the next day and ask it i'm not going to ask them to roll back

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,839
and and search for it it's gone on most tools so i love

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,560
asynchronous because it really focuses in on

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
prolonging knowledge sharing and giving people this

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
uh choosing people can choose their own time of day

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,560
to participate in open source they don't have to be on at all times

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,959
but let's say synchronous is the right place for your community at this time

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,399
i'd like people to think a little bit bigger so it's going to be more advanced

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,560
but let's say you're already in irc which is your preferred place cool do

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,639
that thing but use elements

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,240
they're not paying me for this but i've found that i love what they do here

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,399
they offer a bridge to use irc protocol and connect it to another channel inside

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
their community so you can bridge that connection make

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,360
the same channel from irc in elements under this idea of a

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,639
community which in many ways is like an entire

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
slack team you have multiple channels in there that are associated and using

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,600
the same apps so you can do that and then on top you

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,839
can layer a community contributors channel so that people who

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,480
are newer can banter and get to know each other

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
and now you're building tiers of relationships where your maintainers can

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,120
chat and people can pop in and ask questions

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
and those are synced and then community contributors are doing their thing

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,959
that can be really really satisfying if you want to go even more advanced

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
add a third channel they they can connect together through bridges

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,760
so you can add slack to your configuration use channels there to map

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,279
to your element one your irc community is still doing its

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
thing but you're growing this multi-channel conversation that is where

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
people prefer to converse and if you want to get a ton more

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
visibility add some bots that are taking mastodon

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,120
traffic and twitter traffic and posting it into your

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
your channel so that you can go and then respond to them if you find interesting

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,760
people there so you're really starting to get a

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,639
broader range of experience and awareness

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
and find that broader range of people that care about your project by being on

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,320
the channels that they choose to be on and the future is it's going to be

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
where the contributors are not necessarily where you want to be all the time

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
so thinking about that and putting it all together

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,199
it really i hope my example is one that

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,760
kind of makes this make sense that i started from proprietary hardware

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,560
company out of college not knowing what i was

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
building or how it related to anything open source

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,519
i had to learn linux for that job a little bit and then i learned a little

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,480
bit more but slowly but surely i found this way

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
into an open source ecosystem that brought me a ton of joy

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
and it was only after i participated for many years

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,160
that i had any idea what i was participating in and

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,519
now as somebody who's a maintainer and contributor to multiple

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,240
large projects and small ones as well i find it so satisfying and i really want

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,360
other people to be able to find this with a little bit more ease than myself

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
and the communication channels really are the choice that will allow people to

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,680
either be part of this from the beginning or

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,199
feel excluded from the beginning our goals should not be that they to

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,639
tell people to try harder to communicate with us

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,199
that is within reason as a maintainer if you are already overworked you don't

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,120
have to do all of this we shouldn't be making people feel dumb

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,160
for not knowing irc and a way around that is to be

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,920
multi-channel to use the tools that are freely available

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
to us to connect the dots between different channels

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,839
and the users that prefer to be there it's inclusive it's engaging and it

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,600
really helps people find you and find this larger community

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,399
of open source so start with inclusivity and we can

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,040
educate people on open values along the way

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
i didn't really care about privacy until i really

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,600
read up on it more after being a regular contributor to projects and starting to

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
see the history of open source as something

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,600
that connects to privacy and connects to the licensing that

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,720
matters behind it so now that i'm there i have a

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
preference and bias towards that but let's not expect people who aren't

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,279
there yet to know it already we have to first invite people in before

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,519
we can necessarily teach them what is important about open

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,560
source and maybe they won't care but like use

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,959
the channels that work for others and if this isn't the type of work that

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,639
you love doing i totally get it recruit people who are into it recruit

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,920
maintainers who aren't say coding all the time on your

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,640
project but think about the multi-disciplinary

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
skills needed in your community and recruit for it because this isn't

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,520
trivial and when we trivialize communication it ends up poorly and

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,760
your community suffers for it so remember that the communities that

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
contribute to open source are open source if they're on slack if

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,280
they're on twitter if they're on rocketchat or irc we don't

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,520
get to choose that definition that's implied by the open source definition

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,360
so be where people are connect them to your cause and your your project and

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,760
maybe on the way they will grow and learn more open

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,480
source as well i certainly have so thank you so much it's such an honor

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,559
to be part of this project from the open source initiative i want

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,799
to also give props to mozilla who was very public about their choosing of

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
their communication channel and inspired me to look into this more

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,360
and i hope if you're interested in opensource.com

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,559
you'll reach out to me but thanks and let's go to q & a

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
sounds good thank you so much thank you all for being here um

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
what a what a strange experience to be watching the conversation while hearing

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,960
myself speak but it was really fun and um really happy to

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
see people respond to this um but

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,240
i do want to take questions either on about your community and how to think

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,080
about communication um or or just i'm okay with just

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
statements as well if there's a gap in my history here i think there have been

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,760
some great points that i don't want to miss next time

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,679
in the next rev so any questions to start

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
okay that's the start of the question okay

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
what's the first thing you'd use in a new project

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,559
thank you whoever gave me this layup i appreciate you a lot

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,720
my absolute favorite place to start these days since i do try to have a bias

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
towards asynchronous communication so i don't

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,400
accidentally create multiple pockets of community

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,880
based on geos based on time zones is to use discourse it's it's

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,000
free and open source license fantastic community support

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,679
you can they have a very inexpensive hosted if you want them to run it for

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,799
yourself and my absolute favorite part of it is

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,039
that if you're if uh you have a multi generations of

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,880
open source contributors in the same space and some of them really want

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
mailing lists and other people want a forum type experience with emojis like crazy

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
discourse provides both at the same

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,160
time each of the categories you set up on discourse you can also configure as

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,400
their own mailing list and then so you have all the new tools

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
and it works perfectly well as a plain text mailing

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,160
list at the same time so if you're gonna start with only one

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,320
thing discourse is absolutely the thing i would start with

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,640
um on the chat side if you were really into chat only i'm

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,000
really enjoying element um it still has a couple of the gnarly hey can i talk to

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
your version of name server configuration things

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,400
um but i think it's getting so good that um and it aligns really well with

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
the the culture of our community in the open world

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,440
but um really start with what your community needs

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
so thinking from who is coming into the space and

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
how do i make them feel welcome and if that means you have to set up slack

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,280
whether you like it or not like give that a go

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,559
if it means your community is really active on facebook

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,240
start there and pull them off as soon as possible if you're willing to

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
i think i'm i try to be very open to where my community is

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,000
uh and then slowly draw them to where i would prefer us being

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,240
so number two uh where are the next generation of contributors

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,240
maybe specifically thinking 18 to 25 demographic

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,960
um i i think they're out there i mean they're by if you follow

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,919
github state of the octoverse it's their year-over-year metrics of growth and

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,080
participation the participation and the amount of

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,320
repositories on github in particular are always up and to the right same goes

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,320
for git lab i see reports from the apache foundation

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,600
and the linux foundation and cncf that contribution is at

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,440
uh is is up and to the right as well and there are some interesting academic

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,679
reports showing that people are contributing

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,080
um so the it seems that there's a large agreement that

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,679
there is more contribution um and then i can't

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,240
speak for all younger people but i am seeing through some of the communities

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,039
that reach out specifically to universities

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,320
there's an increasing amount of open source interest in that space

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,000
uh rit just announced that they have an ospo

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and are teaching an open source minor i believe

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
and are encouraging contribution uh someone spoke there

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,600
at this event and we're working on an article on opensource.com

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,880
and i work with some wonderful people through the chaos community who a lot of

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,679
them are college students who are doing their very first pull

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
requests of the project and it's it's fantastic so

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,720
for better or worse i think it does aggregate on github because it has the

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,640
glossiest experience and people tend to gravitate

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,320
there but i i bet there are a lot of cases

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
that i'm not privy to and are very you know based on geography

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,320
if other people have thoughts on there please add comments to the

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,600
shared notes on where younger people are contributing from i'd love to hear your

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,840
take

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,799
so any thoughts on best practices for information management between corporate

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,960
and public open source channels yeah coordinating between

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,679
multiple issue trackers and channels yes that was my beast of burden for

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,600
about two years at intel slowly trying to get us to be developing

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
a couple of our cloud projects in the open as opposed

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,960
to behind in a closed jira but through open issues through github

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,120
management since that's where the project was and

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,000
i'd say try to find the places where you can

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,480
push the boundaries a little bit so we we absolutely had to use an

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,440
internal jira tracker but there was no rule against us connecting

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,760
that jira tracker to a github ticket through a bot so we made

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,280
a bot to do so and we had bi-directional

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
synchronization and if you can get bi-directional that is absolutely ideal

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,360
i know that is ideal which means you're not going to get it every time

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
but same goes for if you can get the communication channels to be public by

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,360
default and you can do a lot and there are good

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,039
reasons to that will take a much longer argument to

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,919
make um so if if you want to talk more about

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
that i'd love to dig into it but um maybe some of the data from chaos

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,200
or from cncf on like how effective it is to contribute in

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,039
public will help support that argument because ultimately

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
it's a risk reward conversation with some executive sponsor

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,720
and if you can figure out what their decision-making decision making matrix

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,039
looks like you can push them towards the direction

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,440
that you hope for cool all right last but not least uh where

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,960
would you suggest a project start that's actively attempting to bring

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,159
people into tech so not generally tech savvy already

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,559
that is um a really wonderful uh wonderfully complex

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,880
question i i think i quite honestly don't have the

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,679
most experience there um to be uh blunt i

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,400
and so i end up um i help my a couple of my friends who are teachers

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,159
in like uh the the city of minneapolis where i live

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,080
and i try to talk to them about how they're getting their students to adopt

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
technology right now through remote learning

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,400
and you know getting them to jump on irc for instance was not

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
out of the question but when i showed them kind of

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,840
the litany of tools we just went over here

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
they did land on discourse as something that

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
might make sense to one group of the the high school students they were working

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,200
with and other another friend of mine landed

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,880
on slack and they're like slack is great for them they get it it makes sense

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,320
and it's kind of like the sandbox environment

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,279
so for the less tech savvy um i think no matter what you choose

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
it's really i would be looking very closely at the onboarding

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,720
tools and whether you can customize onboarding to be

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
very thoughtful and then it's more about like what are you doing as a community leader

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
to giving people support along the way

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,080
um for me that that i think about office hours regularly where people can come in

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,760
with unstructured questions really good channels for structured

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,919
questions online and then one-to-one outreach of find

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,360
your influencers in your community who you know may be more vocal about the

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,440
challenges than other people and get them to explain what's going on

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,960
and collaboratively you know share that through whatever

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,960
news outlet you've created so think about i mean most projects can

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,279
benefit from having a very simple blog attached to it in in that new space and

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,520
you can talk about the challenge of onboarding to this new project

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
and write it up and have all those tutorials turn into

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,120
a source of communication that helps your community grow

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
so thinking about those quadrants i didn't have time to get into them that's

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
a hour-long talk in and of itself um but thinking about

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
how you interact across these channels like how asynchronous

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
communication turns into an asynchronous answer

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,880
and that asynchronous answer turns into a news outlet

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,400
and then you have a face-to-face or virtual meeting to talk about it in more

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,120
detail and then you go around the circle again

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:07,360
so think communicating a ton will be the the way you get over that pain

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,400
because i mean one way or the other learning technology even when you're

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,880
good at some other technology is incredibly painful and if you haven't

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
learned something new recently and please go do that and just feel as

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,640
foolish as you feel when you don't know how to do something and you're really

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,480
good at a bunch of other stuff so think about that whenever you're

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,640
trying to adopt a technology and uh be ready to help people through

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,620
that and make it normal to be learning and to ask questions

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
