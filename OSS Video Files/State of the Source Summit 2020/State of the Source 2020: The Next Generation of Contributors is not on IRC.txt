Description: 
	The Next Generation of Contributors is not on IRC
Matthew Broberg

There is some combination of a turf war and a diaspora happening in the open source communities when it comes to communication. Every platform has its fans and haters with firmly held opinions on how it's the best or worst thing in the world. That's fine for regular contributors, but what about new ones? What are our communities searching for when they hop into communication channels? How do we meet new members where they are? Let's talk about what that looks like in practice.
