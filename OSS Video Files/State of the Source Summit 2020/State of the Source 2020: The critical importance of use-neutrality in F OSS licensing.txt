Description: 
	The critical importance of use-neutrality in F/OSS licensing
Roland Turner

Embedding exclusionary "ethical use" obligations in F/OSS licenses seems like a great idea, however it undermines both the freedom objectives of Free Software and the inclusiveness objectives of Open Source Software. I'll detail why doing this can't possibly achieve what's intended, what harm expanding the Open Source Definition to support it would do, and what cooperation between F/OSS and exclusionary communities might be possible.

hi i'm roland turner chief privacy officer

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,639
at trustsphere and part of the organizing team

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,840
for the fossasia annual open tech summit here in singapore

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
i'm going to talk to you today about use neutrality and its critical importance

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
in the licensing of free and open source software i'm going to

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
cover three broad areas firstly the objectives of licensing

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
schemes both foss and use discriminatory secondly i'll

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,720
argue that use discriminatory systems are both ineffective and harmful and

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,760
therefore a terrible idea at least for osi and finally i'll nonetheless explore

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,520
what scope for cooperation might exist with use discriminatory

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
communities for osi a bit of background i think it's

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,239
probably reasonable from time to time to revisit why we're here where we came

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,680
from what we're trying to achieve additionally in the last 12 months there

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
has once again been an effort to bring use discrimination into the osi

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,760
definition and osi approved licenses this time under the heading of so-called

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,600
ethical licensing qualifying ethical for two reasons one

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,920
the use of the adjective implies a binary characteristic either i

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
think is ethical or is not that is not true

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
all ethical analysis lies on a spectrum but secondly

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,360
that ethics starts from a selection of relevant values

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
and these differ from person to person and perhaps more importantly from

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,880
society to society consequently licensing

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
cannot even be considered ethical on a spectrum because it very much depends uh

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
who's looking at it and who's assessing it a little bit about me

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
this is more about understanding my biases than any sort of

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
authority claim i've been reasoning and in some cases arguing in public about

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,320
the application of freedom source licensing for a long time

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,240
when netscape held its consultation on the mozilla public license for use for

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
its initial release of the mozilla browser back in 98

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
i argued at some length for the use of gnu gpl

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
exclusively when it became quite clear that there were quite legitimate

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
objectives of netscape that were not compatible

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
with gnu gpl that was either then proposed

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
inspired by pearl's licensing structure the idea of

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
multiple licensing of the missile browser and although this didn't happen

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,400
immediately a year later it was picked up by the mozilla

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,520
organization and gave rise to mpl11 and its multi-licensed structure

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
in addition to being part of the fossasia procedures organizing team for the

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
summit here in singapore i'm also a frequent speaker

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
and often on the underlying philosophy of free and open source software

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
and my work as a chief privacy officer therefore data protection officer

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
involves applying human rights directly to technological systems under

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
the processing of particularly personal data this is

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
gdpr in udhr terms this is articles 12 and 19

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
and finally although i work with the law and where appropriate i

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
sort of request for my sign up by lawyers i am not myself

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,120
a lawyer obviously you should not interpret anything in this as legal

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
advice i'd like to be clear about what argument

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
i'm making because there are some obvious

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
errors one might make or obviously assumptions in great assumptions why not

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,959
given that i'm objecting to the embedding of edhr in

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
licenses i support progressive initiatives in

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
foss communities in particular the successful implementation of codes

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
of conduct for both online and uh in-person

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
interactions in many communities has been a great success

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,480
yes there are also abuses but by and large it's been a success and has

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,920
materially improved civility and therefore

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
inclusiveness in free and open source communities over

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,360
the last decade and a bit and i hope that continues i clearly support

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,560
the pursuit of udhr objectives it's a large part of what i do for

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,879
living what i oppose is use discrimination in foss licenses

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
i'll start by briefly looking at licensing objectives

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
for free software of course freedom zero is the freedom to run the program as you

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
wish for any purpose now this is about a strong statement of

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
use neutrality as it's possible to give and even the free software foundation

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
recognizes the importance of this by giving it

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
freedom number zero in the same sense that in thermodynamics the

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
law zero is the most fundamental law and in both cases it was that they sort

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,159
of spelled other laws first and then realized

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,480
oh hey, there's this even more fundamental thing that we missed there's not much

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
point having freedoms to redistribute and to modify if you're not allowed to

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
run the program in the first place so it's used neutrality is not just an

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
interesting thing it is the fundamental freedom for free

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,440
software and indeed this argument is made

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,160
explicitly in terms of rights and freedoms of human beings quote the

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,199
non-free program controls the users and the development across the program

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,040
this makes the program an instrument of unjust

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
power note that the free software foundation free software definition

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
rather is specifically about protecting users

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,320
it really is the rights and freedoms of human beings

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
uh used even stronger language in the past and then this was sort of

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
upsetting to corporate users which gave rise to the open source initiative

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
adopting instead the debian free software guidelines

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
almost word for word there was one immaterial change

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,160
and although more than five of the ten

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
clauses of the definition arguably some sort of neutrality it is

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,639
a article six that is clearest that prohibits discrimination against field

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,680
of endeavor which is interpreted against specific uses

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,720
and the objective that the osi definition of the osi is pursuing is

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
different it's quite distributed peer review and

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
transparency of process, higher quality, better reliability, greater

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
flexibility, lower cost, and it aims to end predatory vendor lock-in

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
unquote that other last item is a bit like

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
the the unjust instrument of power concerns of the free software definition

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
but it's as seen from corporate perspective where you've got an

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
organization you've got council who's accustomed to taking software on

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
board under a license and is also accustomed to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,520
being snookered by uh then by software developers who have a predatory

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
approach and are seeking to lock people in so they don't have to buy

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
their software in preference to to competitors and therefore under worse

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
terms or worse pricing or whatever the open source initiatives objective is

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
to facilitate collaboration and particularly

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,440
collaboration with direct competitors people we don't like, we despise

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,120
the hippocratic license is perhaps the most visible example

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,400
recently of the efforts to bring use discrimination into

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
free and open source licensing quote is the licenses express intent that all

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
users of the software be consistent with the united nations universal declaration

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,080
of human rights unquote and the stated purpose it includes

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
quotes specifically perhaps the use of the software to violate his

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,319
universal standards of human rights unquote so not only is clearly used

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,000
discriminatory it seeks to control users

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
this is diametrically opposed to the approach of the

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
free software foundation and therefore the free software definition which seeks to

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,800
protect users the precipitation recognizes that

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
a power imbalance arises because of the one programmer rights and thousands

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
people use and therefore seeks to progress human rights and

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
freedoms by protecting those users the hippocratic license instead seeks to

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,240
exploit that imbalance to control users i'll be it for a higher purpose

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,400
maybe and i'll get back to that finally just as a data point uh this

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
the islam copyright public license is in such infrequent use that i couldn't even

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
find it on a live website i had to go and

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
fish the text out of archive.org machine this is a thing that i saw years ago

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,120
that is no longer publicly visible it's only available in arabic and of

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,800
course which i can't read so there's unchecked machine translation and any

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
event requires understanding of islam which i don't have

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
i really wish to point out that the moment osi begins to

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
take on board the idea of allowing use restrictive licenses

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,199
the the scope of what's taking on could be quite large

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
and surprising so okay it's not a surprise that uh

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,520
islamic license prohibits any religious license event prohibits immorality and

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
blasphemy but of course those terms lack sufficient precision to

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
allow a judge or arbiter to to infer the intentions of both

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,840
parties and therefore to enforce but even on the positive or the more

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,400
specific obligations there are some surprises

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,039
usury gambling interspace banks all well-known prohibitions of islam

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
insurance companies bit of a surprise turns out that there is in fact a

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,759
separate approach to insurance which is

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,919
consistent with current principles i didn't know that there was a surprise

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,640
factors in shops selling evils books looks like a translation problem

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,519
but nonetheless points to a near certainty of the need for interpretation

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
in what it means it's not a clearly stated

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,640
uh obligation or restriction and finally just in the how out of left field

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,360
the surprises might be everywhere there's dozens of

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
restrictions announcements of praise and praise for the deceased especially if

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
he's not a muslim

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,880
except that perhaps there's an islamic prohibition on such a thing it had

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,839
not even occurred to me that there might be so i'm not critiquing the license

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
it's not in use it's not been put forward for

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,160
osi approval i merely point out that the moment you head down

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,440
the use discrimination path you buy into some perhaps

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,120
quite surprising outcomes or worse uh the need to argue what is and isn't

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
permissible in use restrictions within publicized

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
context which i'd argue is in fact destructive

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
so the first major league of argument is that embedding udhr is ineffective

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,839
and that this arises because the people proposing it

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:41,040
have profoundly misunderstood what udhr is it's a set of principles laid down

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
in the wake of the largest genocide the world ever seen indeed larger than any

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
that's happened since that sort of reset of the relationship

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,560
between the individual and the state it was

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
therefore intentionally aspirational it's not a performance standard

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
it quote shall strike talks of individuals and

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
institutions state and private shall strive

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,640
to secure the recognition observance of these rights

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,720
it was not ever a claim there's a bunch of good countries or

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
relations that did this and that they should be used as a position

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,120
of moral superiority from which to critique bad people

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
it's here's where we would like to get to an ideal world

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
but we're not there no one is there isn't a single country in the world

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,160
that fully implements what udhr sets out to do

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,200
and private sector organizations have a similar problem

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,720
the second part of the misunderstanding is just the sheer

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,480
immensity a staggering immensity of what's involved

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,920
in implementing human rights i'd hazard a guess that there are several million

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,959
people whose full-time work is implementing the rights spelled out

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,200
in udhr by work which in part implements

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
articles 12 and 19 there's one little piece of this with

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
this enormous number of people worldwide doing this

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
the idea that you can sort of you know tack udhr into a license agreement or

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
some other instrument and voila you've made some material

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
contribution to the well-being of human beings in the world

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
is it's preposterous and it's it's a little

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
bit it's simplistic it's sort of armchair activism

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
sitting back from a safe distance pontificating about what the right way

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,880
for the thing is and sort of telling others how

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,800
it should be it's it's not reasonable it comes from what

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,519
appears to me to come from serious ignorance about what's really

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
involved in implementing human rights uh and it also looks like

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
that although udhr has that starts with universal it's not

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,200
quite universal it's actually very large identified with a minority people for

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
whom it doesn't apply uh i wanted to do the whole thing

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
there's thirty articles but i'll touch on the two that touch my work article 12

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
which deals with interference in privacy correspondence honor

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,639
reputation and 19 which is uh seeking imparting

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,079
information particularly with respect to politics

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
so that's about 73 words to turn that into forcible law

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,399
uh took some time so even though the processing of personal data was a

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,079
significant factor in the holocaust this immense genocide set of genocides

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,440
nonetheless it was more than two decades before the first

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
localized and sector-specific laws implementing this particular part of

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
udhr began to appear in particular in states

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,560
in the north of germany also interestingly for federal

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
government in the us

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
another 20 something years later the first

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,480
hall of economy all activities footnote except law enforcement which is

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
dealt me separately uh law appeared this was the data

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
protection directive uh that meant twelve thousand words

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,920
so turning the 73 words in the even part of them because it doesn't

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,800
cover the whole equation but the part of the 73 words in articles 12 and 19 in udhr

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,399
into actionable law for an entire society

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,959
requires an expansion of about 150 fault and in fact after 20 years of experience

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
with that thing that the sort of refinement into the the more

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
recent general data protection regulation or gdpr

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,920
it's five times as large again we're getting close to a thousand times the

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,079
size of the statement of principle

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,120
so i point out that the gap between a statement of principle

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,560
and some enforceable thing law contact or otherwise

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,480
is really really really big the idea that you can embed udhr into

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,240
enforceable law or regulatory force or a contract or a license if it's a naked

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,320
license it doesn't it's not reasonable um and this is sort

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,079
of a using the right tool for the job

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,600
question human rights principles impossible legislation and jurisprudence

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
regulatory powers and private sector contract license terms are four

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
different things yes they're all produced by lawyers in

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,240
the same sense that programs are all produced by programmers

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,480
but you wouldn't expect to be able to take something out of a

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
javascript program and drop it into a python program or a high school program

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,560
or sql code and expect it to work these

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
the way you although the same ideas and same profession produces all of them

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
the detail is different honestly perhaps it's true that these four

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
things are closer together to each other than the four languages are just

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
described but nonetheless it's simply not

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,160
reasonable to attempt to sort of chop and change and just expect it to work

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,600
it generally doesn't one of the arguments is that but

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,959
hey how does the fact that there's been decades of legislative process progress

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,360
and jurisprudence takes away this uncertainty

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,480
no it doesn't. certainly in the case of the hippocratic license

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
it establishes a precedence that says yeah the most protective rules win well

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
because udhr is aspirational then in almost all

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,760
cases it is the one that that controls and

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
that therefore the fact that it gets played out international laws in

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,760
many different ways creates uncertainty a judge or arbiter before enforcing must

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
first discern the intentions of the parties

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
and when it's this way that's not possible a rational

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,399
private contract or even naked license includes

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,480
a specific testable set of restrictions and obligations by the

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,720
by the parties the moment you diverge from that

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
you put yourself in a situation where an otherwise enforceable license becomes

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
unenforceable and worse as i'll argue later you create

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
a tool for abuse with just legal costs uh the other problem i mentioned earlier

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,519
is that it's not quite universal and this is a huge topic so we'll talk

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
differently briefly for time the cairo declaration of human

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
rights in islam whose signatories have within their

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,839
borders approximately a quarter of the world's population

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,240
are disagreeing they're putting forward a different

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,440
uh statement of rights that arises from sharia

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,199
it is according to to reasonably capable experts incompatible with udhr in

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,399
the areas of religious freedom religious and sexual discrimination and

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,880
corporal punishment for starters what i would say here is without getting

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,320
to whether they right or wrong yes some sort of western judeo-christian

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,920
tradition the uhr seems to me a better starting point however that i think it's

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
a good idea is not the same as thinking it's a bad idea for other people to have

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
a different idea and a quarter of the world's population

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
at least arguably more given that there are

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
large muslim populations elsewhere disagreeing

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
means that the claim to universality is a bit thin

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,240
uh more relevant to this talk however the bangkok declaration the signatories to

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,800
the declaration have within their borders is just over half of the world's

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,600
population so arguably those who disagree with the bangkok declaration

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
are in the minority and perhaps more importantly a

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,040
significant number of signatories were in the past colonized by western

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,839
powers and so they have a particular

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,120
sensitivity to sort of self-righteous moralizers telling them what to do they

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
emphasize a non-confidential approach they

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,560
discourage they open with a clear commitment to the principles

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
because that's not actually a lack of universality but they're

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,720
concerned about how they might be used so they emphasize a non-confidential

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
approach they discourage an attempt to use human rights as a conditionality for

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
extended development assistance and then they emphasize the respect for

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,480
national sovereignty and so the yes the

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
experience of being colonized perhaps creates a much stronger sensitivity here

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,799
to someone who accepts these principles and wants to grow into them doesn't want

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,720
outsiders pushing them to implement these things and by

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
creating uh resistance and actually worsening

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,039
the progress of human rights so this is an important point to recognize that if

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,600
you are sort of enabled by the rightness of your

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,320
cause if you you march into foreign lands and start

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
exerting force to implement them you risk not only not progressing your cause

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
but creating enough resistance to retard your cause

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
and this is a sort of large part of the concern expressed

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,799
in the bangkok declaration i'll also point out

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
the so this this also applies directly to the ideas

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,400
in licenses that incorporate compliance with udhr as a condition

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
but conditionality is a problem because it misunderstands that udhr is something

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,960
that you want to be an aspiration of the people not a performance standard you

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,360
wish to use to beat people over the head it also fails to notice that the

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,960
overwhelmingly the people whose human rights are in need of development

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
are those in poorer countries who can't and indeed

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
in countries to the current equation for example

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
who are using free and open software because they can't

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,880
afford to buy commercial software the last

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
thing we want to be doing is getting in the way of those people

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
the one of the point i take out of the bangkok declaration is the observation that

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
states have the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,760
human rights that is that private sector

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,720
organizations although they have obligations

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
it is problematic for them to be trying to affect

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,840
political change yes it's normal in a number of western countries but in a

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,880
large part of the world it isn't and it's actually harmful it's

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
actually harmful and again for this reason

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,200
having stuff embedded in private licenses that tries to get in the way of

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
or rather tries to push people towards a particular

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
world view is potentially problematic and there's actually explicit guidance

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,240
on this front from the UN as i'll come to later talk

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,640
have i gotten past the sort of profound misunderstandings

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
i'd argue the largest single reason for stating that

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,200
embedding udhr in license is is ineffective is that it's quite simply

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,679
unlikely to stop the bad guys for a number of reasons

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
one is they're likely to be outside of jurisdiction where any of the developers

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,320
have standing to bring action another is that in many cases

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,000
outsourcing neuters the license and this is sort of why agbl came about

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
because cloud computing on the face of it allows

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
invalidating the new gpl in many cases rights abusers

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
are enjoy sovereign immunity and so they they can't be touched

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,000
by a license by any form of action about the breach of a licensed

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,679
conditional contract and finally at worst of the time you know we don't

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,320
exist to look after the the interest of programs we have to give

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,159
us stuff for free rather than changing our behavior

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,000
us being sort of theoretical rights of using relation we'll just pay for clone

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,559
source in reality more likely to use open

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,880
source that doesn't have udhr tacked onto the obligations but

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,919
this is what i'm saying here is that attaching udhr as a license condition is

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
ineffective right up front but it's unlikely to stop

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,280
bad guys from doing bad things there might be some other reasons that

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,640
developers want to limit their software being used

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
in situations that abuse human rights but

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
preventing the bad guys from abusing human rights

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,240
almost certainly isn't the outcome you can usually expect

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
and therefore probably shouldn't be used as the argument for this

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,039
it's also absurd uh imagine a hardware store that

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,159
was willing to tell you screwdrivers and screws and nails and whatever as long as

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
you first entered into a binding contract

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
not to use these things to assemble terrorist weapons uh

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,039
quite obviously the harvest or the debt would go out of business likewise a

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,440
stationer that uh required you to enter a dividing

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,400
agreement not to use their pencils the pencils you buy from them

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,720
to write terrorist manifestos this also starts to get in the way of political

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,679
but political participation rights that udhr

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,520
calls out the idea that sort of putting license

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,640
conditions into a or used conditions into the sale of a

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
thing or licensing the thing clearly creates some absurdities and not

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,200
just pencils also things like text editors and mail clients and mail

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,480
centers um you might take taking the thing to

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,280
the extreme perhaps a bookseller or a library who requires that their

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
customers or readers enter into binding agreements not

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
to use what they learned from reading these books

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,880
for oppression george orwell would be truly proud

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
so all this begs a question about where the line is

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
it seems that there's a thing where it's not okay that our stuff's being used for

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,919
bad and yet i'm also arguing that it's not our problem because

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,760
you know otherwise it would be impossible to sell pencils how do you

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,679
reason about this so hopefully the UN has published through its office of the

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,559
high commission for human rights guidance on this exact question i

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,760
strongly recommend people who are concerned about this read this guide to

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,039
help untangle your head how to think about

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,480
human rights and you know where responsibilities are

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,039
and where to engage and where not to uh right off the top effects on the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,880
title page and you can see it but it's the idea of uh protect respect

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,760
and correct or something um right off the

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,480
top the this guidance separates for human rights obligations

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,200
for state versus private sector actors in the state's cases to protect the safe

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,840
state must intervene in the private sector cases to respect

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,080
self-appointed police officers you need not apply

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,559
this is about looking at all about ensuring that you're not

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,080
sort of actively making the thing worse but it's certainly not the case

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
and arguably not appropriate for privacy directors to insert themselves in other

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
places again whether this is true varies from

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
country to country but as a sort of an attempt to

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,720
identify universal uh norms and end up with licensing this is an

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,640
appropriate question is certainly not the case that private

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,559
sectors should in general be attempting to insert themselves uh other

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,720
than the way they're directly involved um i will skip lots of

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,200
interesting detail because we're getting out of time but the uh

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,280
importantly this guidance talks about what appropriate action is and a quote

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,240
appropriate action will vary according to the impact of actors

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,760
extent of access to leverage in addressing the adverse impact

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
leverage is considered to exist where the actor has the ability to effect

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,880
change in the wrongful practices of an entity that causes a harm

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,720
unquote so this is the test and the reason that my sort of earlier

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,559
point on we can't stop the generally with cancers of bad guys

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,679
is relevant if your proposed proposed intervention

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,159
does not have the ability to affect to affect change at least not materially

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,200
then it's not an appropriate action it has

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,320
it'll do the hearts it may have other benefits

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,760
and one might argue about the desirability of the benefits

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
but certainly from the standpoint of promoting human rights it's not an

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,919
appropriate action if it doesn't have the ability to affect change and i would

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,799
argue that tacking udhr onto license agreements

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,159
really doesn't other than some really obscure corner cases similar

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
enough to warrant changing the sort of basic framework

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,760
so how then to think about actions which have

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,720
negligible leverage those which have direct leverage of course you are you

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
should be using but what about where the direct leverage is negligible

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,279
and in particular where there's a question about establishing norms

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,279
maybe osi has this ability. certainly projects developing

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,840
license under software under osi approved licenses do in some cases

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,440
so where that impact is negligible there's a risk of empty virtue signaling

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
or lip service the tendency to sort of talk about how

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
excellent someone know what some organization is

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,000
without actually lifting a finger to do anything to improve whatever it is

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
that they're talking about to sort of clear hey we support human rights

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,919
because we develop software with a ethical license on it but not actually

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,440
take any other action to to achieve the improvement of human

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,520
rights in the world there's also a more serious risk that of

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,480
dishonest signaling that you'll end up with for example green washing where

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,760
major polluters plant a few trees and claim to be you know

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,400
staunch defenders of the environment that they are destroying

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,159
however yes what if there is a potential for material impact

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,320
on establishment of norms what to do then and so the first thing

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,799
is okay many human beings most human beings are

00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,600
motivated to do the right thing most of the time

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,200
but also more concrete leaders you know can we support progress

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
and so the answer that would seem to be yes of course we should sort of tackle

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,640
udhr obligations to the free and open source licenses because that will support

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
progress or at worst you know help shift norms

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
that will cause uh progress elsewhere because hey

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,520
it costs us nothing right well no i will talk in particular about harm

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
to foss but it should be obvious that these harms

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,480
actually apply much more broadly in many cases

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
um i will start right at home article 23 everyone has the right to work to free

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,640
choice of employment to justifiable conditions of work and do protection

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
against unemployment a good fraction of the people watching

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,039
this have heard some or they're living in the last decade or two

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
from either or both of automating things that used to take a lot of human work

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,200
thereby putting people out of work or establishing

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,720
gig work to support structures for gig work economies

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,039
which although they normally help fix some of that problem

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,159
have the net effect of eroding a great deal of the progress that was made in

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
the in the protections of people who need to

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,080
work for a living and therefore in the the variable

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,200
conditions so on one telling the either the automation or the gig

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
work uh economy framework breach article 23

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,760
at least in the short term hopefully we'll believe that to the

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,640
extent that we're doing these things that over the longer term

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,880
technological change gives rise to new demand and the available supply of labor

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
will adapt itself to that demand as has happened many times in the past

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,760
but certainly in the short term there's there's a strong argument to be made

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,520
that article 23 is being breached at least some of the time this gives

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
rise to what i described as the cardinal wichita

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,679
problem this is the an abusive french

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,600
priest who is abusing legal process to silence his enemies quote

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,200
if you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
i will find something in them which will hang him

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,480
also consequences of captain punishment the point being that once you tack your

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
udhr on almost anybody can be found to be in

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,080
bridge somewhere and so this gives rise to a process

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,120
abuse risk we've seen occasional reports of this in

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,320
the implementation codes of conduct in freedom open source communities but

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,559
i'd argue that it's the exception rather than the rule

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,480
nonetheless the the motive is there there's also the problem that at least

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,200
in the u.s there's a much lower standard for civil than for

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,840
criminal law uh and so this gives rise to an abuse risk of the following

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,399
type and it applies to sort of both ends of most arguments

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,520
let's look at abortion that uh udhr in fact is unclear on right to life but

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,559
how is that apparent tension struck or addressed between the rights

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,320
of the mother and the rights of the potential rights of an unborn fetus

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
so okay uh we have an activist either an

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,919
anti-abortion activist looking at uh trying to harm an abortion

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,000
clinic or a pro-choice activist looking to harm

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,039
a let's say a church or other advocacy organization

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,720
which is staunchly opposing abortion rights

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,159
in both cases the activist by whatever means

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,159
determines that the target organization is using some piece of software under

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
a license which includes udhr that person then

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,039
quietly joins the project that produces that bit of software

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,039
makes material contributions all right thank you wait since i have evidence the

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,080
target organization is using those improvements or a version of

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,399
something that contains them and then starts a legal process against them and

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,000
no matter how that plays out the at the very least there's an

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,240
argument to be had and you've got to pay lawyers to

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,679
to win uh there's harm to be done and so this is

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,799
the process of issues that by bringing in this sort of all these set of

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,039
principles rather than a specific set of

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,720
prohibitions and obligations you put a weapon in the hands of

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,799
dishonest abusers masquerading as activists to

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,520
make the world a better place and so for that that reason alone i

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,640
would argue that tacking udhr onto free and open source licenses is a

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,000
terrible idea uh this is part of a broader idea that

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
some writers describe as the outrage industrial

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,120
complex willfully creating drama is itself potential harm

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,640
this has gotten so bad over the last decade that researchers are beginning to

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
observe that whole populations are abandoning

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,120
truth-directed methods of persuasion rather

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,240
relying on the identification of friend or foe

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,799
or broadly authority politics uh this is bad generally it's particularly

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,120
destructive to FOSS communities for two reasons one

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,799
where engineers producing software we have to deal with reality we can't deal

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,399
with just political experience because if we stick to the ladder we end up with

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,039
software that simply doesn't work but secondly because we are so spread

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,880
out and so diverse bringing these fights

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,480
into our forum will rip us apart in a much more serious way than is true for

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,640
sort of closed source typically commercial development communities

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,480
and so a really important idea here is that we all benefit from the work of

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480
people that we profoundly disagree with or even despise and they from us

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,399
this is in fact the principal idea behind representative politics

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,519
the representatives of a population elected ideally

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,200
uh meet and sort of hammer out common ground despite people who otherwise

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,039
disagree enormously about all kinds of things an unreasonable approach to that

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,320
situation is to seek to exclude those other people a civilized approach

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
is to seek to include them and find common ground and

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,679
i would argue that the idea of sort of unhr compliance is a licensing

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,640
term is an example of the exclusion and trying to separate from these people

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,480
that we disagree with or indeed despise rather than a more inclusive

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,960
approach that i think most of us would see as appropriate indeed that osi was

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,200
built to promote um a smaller harm is license evaluation

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
this is a really important service that osi performs because

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
it's out of which most developers and because there's a benefit in a sort of

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,519
small set of consensus licenses so this is different

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,360
to the problem about which users you're allowed to

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
disallow a use description license from the outset is necessarily

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,279
sorry evaluating it is necessarily user specific

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,799
because osi doesn't know what developers are doing let alone what end users are

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,640
using it can't do it it can't give the same sort of

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,159
comfort in decision making that the existing license evaluation

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,279
process does so whatever games might be pursued by seeking

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,640
use discriminate licensing you need to weigh against amongst other things

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,279
destroying this or these devaluing this most basic of things that osi does

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
i've talked already about the oppression that having a license or capital

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,080
imposing their will upon another human being

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,600
represents in particular doing so outside of

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,120
imminent harm or political process because those are the perhaps exceptions

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
in a civilized society where we say okay the state can do it but there needs to

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
be some sort of accountable political process

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,080
individuals can do it in a sort of imminent harm situation to

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,360
either protect a person from an accident or indeed to

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,000
prevent an aggressor from from doing deliberate harm

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,519
but none of those applies to what's being proposed and therefore what's been

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,080
proposed is in that sense oppressive the real risk of course is that the

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,320
organizations that people who wish to do this which to

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,399
attach udhr licenses uh trying to control

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,760
will just use purchase or commission proprietary software instead or the very

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,120
least exclude licenses that include these kinds of terms

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,080
much as they are already doing with agpl

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,480
and so as i deal with the privacy and security components of what my employer

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,120
does i do also get involved in licensed terms that relate to freedoms

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,679
and software and i'm increasingly seeing

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,200
organizations requiring blanket prohibitions on the

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,679
use of software and gpl because of course of the risk of someone

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,720
abusing what license are trying to achieve to

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
create a process of use risk and that they can then

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,039
nibble away with lawyers and so in that respect again it's ineffective that

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,880
the people that you are trying to control will simply not use uh

00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
software that includes these obligations and we'll use something else instead and

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,840
more importantly because of course most open source

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,320
software that's in widespread use is developed

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,720
by someone on the payroll corporation often in work time

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,079
the it also seriously harms the source of the open source software in fact

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
it's frequently overlooked because the freedom software screenups

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,520
or software is not actually about individual hobbyists cheering stuff at

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,560
all the vast majority of it is now written by and used by large

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,040
corporations and this is desirable it's in fact was the point

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,280
of the founding of the osi so again the the drivers who are embedding udhr

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,560
licenses are contradictory to what osi is trying to achieve

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,480
so okay if you accept my argument that it's

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,839
ineffective and harmful then job don't go home right well not so

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,280
quickly i believe that these are well

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,359
well-intended attempts to impede earlier on i had previously assumed that

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,240
there was sort of conscious efforts towards the process

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,680
abuse outcome i'm now less convinced but i accept that the intentions are good

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,320
nonetheless it's not bad guys it's humble the foss

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,240
communities they're a really it's a really bad idea

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,240
and i do wonder what interest is being pursued and there is comment i

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,480
don't know how to claim but it's the sort of the true objective of the

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
communities pursuing this but it occasionally

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,680
looks as though it's really about the developers feelings and perhaps the

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,000
reputations then it is about the rights of human

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,480
beings and particularly uh oppressed and under represented minorities and that

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,320
that's a rather unfortunate situation if true i i

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
can't argue that that's universally true but it seems

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,320
evidence to suggest that it's what's going on at least in some cases

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,040
so but okay accept all that you then left with a couple of perhaps underlying

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,800
objections that are worth addressing at least briefly uh one is the

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,640
idea that the whoops hello that the developer wants to decide who

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
gets to use their work that's fine this is two vowels

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,440
who writes the code writes the rules i'm not arguing that individual developers

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,400
or indeed organizations should not do this i'm arguing that osi

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,520
the freedom resource software communities should not do it so you're

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,240
perfectly free to license on non-foss terms

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,680
as it has always been the case it's it's this is i'm arguing

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,640
specifically about the rationale and practice of foss licensing

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
the other is this but hey we're responsible because someone used

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,440
something to do too bad things well no they didn't right the

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
screwdriver the hardware salesman the station salesman the book seller or

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,920
library are not responsible for somebody people

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
with their screwdrivers pencils and books

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,079
but they're just not uh there is the sort of

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,480
shonky salesman's the con is you know you have to do something this is

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,359
something you have to do this thinking is to get the

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,480
the customer slash mark so preoccupied with the

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,680
the awful problem they give you something but they sort of lack the

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,240
resources to adequately evaluate the solution that's being proposed and

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,599
therefore we'll sort of buy poorly make a poor purchase

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,040
decision on something that's either ineffective or actually harmful

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,880
uh broadly speaking of course this is the mechanism behind impulse activism

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
which is not helpful it makes people feel good it

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
makes some organizations look good but it doesn't do much to

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,839
progress that the rights of human beings in the world

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,440
so what this leaves is you know i don't like that bad people will do bad things

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,560
with software that i have contributed to and okay sure notice that this is

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,079
quite explicitly about the feelings of developers and

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,760
again it invites this interpretation but what's really going on is the developers

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,599
feelings are being put ahead of the rights and well-being of billions

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,240
of people let us assume that's not really the case

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,680
that's not the reason we're doing this that really this is just empty

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,839
purchasing multiple tactile attack these terms only

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,400
even if they're ineffective and may be harmful because that makes us

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,880
look good looking after a reputation rather than the harm that you

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,400
claim you're talking about even that's pretty offensive so okay let's go one

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
better and assume that actually you really do care about that the rights

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
of the people whose human rights are currently not being

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,880
well protected okay what to do about that if not

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,640
licensed terms this is the broad social control problem there are multiple

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,079
leapers available and just examples include private contractor

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,160
licensing law regulation a custom particular

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,960
civility is perhaps the largest mechanism that societies use to ensure

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,680
that their members respect each other or affect each other's rights properly

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,920
religion is surprisingly important not just i'm not religious man but the

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,960
it's not just the be nice to each other the basic ideas

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,720
that the mama taught you was a child earlier this year the vatican put out

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,240
the wrong call for ethics and ai which is a specific actionable framework

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,040
for use by developers preparing ai solutions to problems it's it's

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,520
there is real world space for religious organizations as

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
sort of mediators and arbiters of of ethical norms

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,119
to act in this space rather than just saying oh no we sort of disclaim the

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,040
importance of religion we'll shut everything into

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,960
into our license terms uh professional ethics turns out to be a huge one

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,920
certainly i mentioned lawyers earlier the idea that you only get to practice

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
if you a member understanding of a personal body

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,640
and the personal body has an interest in its own existence and ensuring that

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,280
abusers get kicked out either suspended or removed

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,160
from the organization and so the deal ends up being that society grants an

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,560
otherwise objectionable monopoly in return for a good outcome this

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,920
applies to highly skilled professions where the

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,119
clients must take an enormous risk on the

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,800
honesty of the practitioners it doesn't apply to every

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,160
field of endeavor every field of work but it does apply to a

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,960
specific set of areas where professionalism applies

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
and multiple areas of human rights are affected or improved by

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,720
the existence of professional ethics labor union's, entirely different mechanism,

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,920
but have been a major force in progressing

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
human rights for really a very large fraction of humanity

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,960
over the last 120 years so there's what i'm saying here is uh

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,320
don't get sort of hung up on this hammer that is

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,200
open source licensing conditions and treat everything as a corresponding

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,320
nail there are many other tools available in frequently more appropriate

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,599
tools so expanding the earlier framework is

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,119
how to think about actions with negligible direct leverage that is to

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,760
say for example taking new dhl into open source licenses and adding a cost

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,040
dimension and in particular what happens when we

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,920
recognize that there's a material cost hopefully i've just convinced you that

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,000
that's true if the impact on establishing norms remains negligible

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,880
then you're in the somewhat abusive situation where those who are promoting

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,280
it are treating harm to existing values as

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,079
an externality not their problem and respectfully i would argue this is

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,319
in fact arguably what's happening with people

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,119
who are trying to push huge subjective licensing norms

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,560
into open source licensing because they've

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,240
put at best the rights of human beings as

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,520
being directly affected by our work as being

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,960
a greater value than uh use neutrality and i've argued at

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,560
some length why that's unique value is really really important

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,280
arguably as a community something we should read is more important

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,680
but let us suppose that the benefits of this indirect action the norms

00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,800
establishing and strengthening norms uh is something that we that we care about

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,520
we face a dilemma either we decide that the loss was

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,400
the harms i've described are acceptable in return for this particular game

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,280
clearly what is believed by those who are promoting it

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,319
and this is great public demonstrations of commitment limit free riders

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,480
unlike the lip service and green washing cases but

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,359
what happens if you conclude as i have but these harms are unacceptable

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,640
in that case you perhaps look for ways to cooperate

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
so okay what are we going to cooperate with so ethical source programs are

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
being talked about i would suggest that amongst other

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,000
things this might include building a body of use resistant software

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
and recruiting users and developers and the same ongoing cycles that exist in

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,839
free open source communities uh it would seem obvious to seed with an

00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,200
existing body of open source software it's too hard to repeat what stormland

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,040
did for the government project the the writing of a compiler and a editor

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,599
at a shell on a build system from scratch and getting to the point

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,839
where they're still hosting on existing operating systems

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,200
is something that very few human beings have ever done or will ever do

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,560
and is probably sort of unharmful overkill

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,160
today 20 30 years ago different story but today

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,000
not reasonable fortunately most open source software most licenses

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,400
permit the addition of discriminatory restrictions downstream the license the

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,280
resulting license is not called open source but there's nothing stopping you

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,640
taking something particularly out of the bc licenses or your ip license and

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,839
embedding them in a proprietary product usually all you get all you're left with

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,720
is the obligation to make to credit the source and include

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,480
in copyright analysis so

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,400
the same thing good in principle will be applied by

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,960
a useful licensing program that is take a bunch of open source

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,280
software tack on the additional notices and voila you've got a body of useful

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,760
software it starts considering that you can't do

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,680
this with free software that a program reportedly pursuing the

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,760
rights of improving the rights and freedoms of human beings

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,839
is unable to reuse an existing body of software created by a program or

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,720
movement dedicated to protecting rights and human

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,920
rights and freedoms of human beings and has been doing so for decades

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,079
the food for thought what does this mean for osi uh licensed approval seems

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,319
very doubtful although never say never i've not given a this is not an

00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,079
exhaustive treatment there may be ways to address

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,760
the concerns that are raising affiliate membership is also problematic

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,400
for the same reason however there is some compatibility in goals and most of

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,200
us i think would consider the goals desirable if

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,599
approaches were pursued to strengthening the support

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,280
of human rights by free open source software

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,800
communities that did not involve use discrimination and licensing

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,240
then i'd suggest that the scope affiliate membership uh goes up

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,680
fairly drastically in any event for the reasons i've just argued there's

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,200
a near certainty of a very large body of overlapping source code and therefore

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,960
at least feeding fixes and small improvements back maybe dual licensing

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
don't know what i'm arguing is that although

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,040
i oppose pretty strongly the idea of tacking use restrictions into

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,800
free and open source licenses nonetheless osi as an organization would benefit

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,319
from remaining open to improvement and so certainly engaging

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,839
constructively with people whose motivations are good even if we disagree

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,280
with what they're proposing i'll leave you with two closing thoughts

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,720
uh FOSS are both about protecting the rights and freedoms of

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,599
users and about sustaining their ability to cooperate with people we don't like

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,520
that's free software in the first point and

00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,319
uh open source in the second and the the freedom that people have

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,920
to use to modify and to share the software that we write

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,000
in any way that they wish has changed the world

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,680
we we shouldn't be in a hurry to give this up

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,119
um there uh this video and the slides are

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,480
after that webpage and with luck by the time you see this perhaps a blog post

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,839
expanding on some of these ideas and in any event if you're watching this

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,960
live at the 2020 state of the source summit

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,680
uh we should now be going straight into q&a thank you

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,880
okay so we've got nothing in the outstanding the shared notes it's apart from

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,920
the fact that i've forgotten to push my uh slides onto my website prior to the

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,760
session so yeah questions comments

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,240
yeah it's mario here so i got it at night so to

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,640
to chime in yeah so i'm just wondering

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,839
like so the motivation of many people to

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,200
participate in the free and open source community

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,200
like it's often like they want to also improve the world of course there's

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,720
not just one motivation there are many motivations like

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,680
you know they're excited about technology they want to build something

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,480
nice they want to be part of a community and yeah of course like generate an

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,200
income with what you do but also the community to

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,400
specifically do free and open source because they want to do

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
something good and they want to be part of something good and they don't want to

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,640
be for example taken advantage of and so on so i think

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,640
that seems to be the motivation with people who

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:33,440
recommend like ethical license models and so on so what do you think about

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,599
this in the like

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,000
in regards to the development of open source over many years

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,079
i think it's an important motivator that for open source contributors

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,000
that what they are doing both makes the world a place the world a

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,880
better place and indeed can be seen to make the the world a better place

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,040
I do object specifically to empty virtual signaling there are others i

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,880
made the point of the sort of matrix of the decision matrix

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,520
um there are situations where the things that are a little bit light

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,440
on direct effect nonetheless contribute materially to the formation of norms

00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,839
and for that reason i think they're it's appropriate stuff to uh to support and

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,400
indeed that the specific objective in the udhr

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,839
case of course is one that i do for a living so i strongly want that

00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,200
um are you asking

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,760
whether it's worth finding better ways to

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,040
support human rights or other ways of improving the world and to do so visibly

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,520
as a means of encouraging

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:59,359
people to contribute to FOSS, is that the question you're getting at?

00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,960
well i'm just trying also to understand where is open source heading so we had

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:14,559
for example a couple of years ago presentations and talks about how

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,319
open source projects changed license like for example mongodb which was as

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,599
i understand also a reaction to cloud companies

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,200
and basically using it and not contributing

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,839
sufficient resources back from the perspective of the developers

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:39,920
and yeah points like that and so so for example of course there's not

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,920
just the topic of licenses they are like topics of patents and so

00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,599
on and they're like you you can't accept you

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,160
can't expect to solve everything with a license yeah whatever

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,920
yeah that's that's yeah the right tool for

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,079
the job i agree with that yeah well i do think there's a

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,960
what we're dancing around and it's it is where a number of these things

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,720
have come from and it's sort of alluded to in the the opening

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,760
keynote today um there is a separate motivation here

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,880
to the one that the free software foundation and the open source

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,520
initiative uh were built to address and i think

00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,000
it's appropriate and desirable that that osi

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,520
in particular uh engage with this because it does

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,160
affect sort of where we're going which is the

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,359
best you asked for the free software foundation because of

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,880
the the particular commitments they've made

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,640
it's that while free software was about protecting about

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,400
addressing a specific imbalance that arises between developers and users

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,319
in that because you have one developer and many users you get a

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,599
severe power imbalance very quickly and it gets abused all over the place

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,640
um okay we've solved that problem because now

00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,640
open source is so widespread that although the the freedoms that fsf

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,319
is interested in aren't perfectly committed it is certainly the case that

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,680
abusive underlocking is a much less prevalent

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,440
phenomenon than it was historically give or take

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,440
uh some of apple's behavior with respect to

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,720
uh what's happening it's on it's both on its app store with like

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,480
we want 30 of your revenue no matter what you are or you can't sell here

00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,760
but also things like controlling uh what sorts of mechanisms users can use

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,160
to participate in contract tracing support for

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,319
COVID that's a fairly i i'm not objecting to

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,920
what that they've made the decision there's there are

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,800
inside forces where they can't avoid this but i'm concerned about the fact

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,480
that the uh the power imbalance that's created is

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,680
causing an injustice it's saying that because of the problems

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,240
that apple has in its home country literally billions of human beings can't

00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,160
participate in effective contact tracing so

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,240
this is a really quite serious problem the osi is

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,359
oh let me finish the thought very very quickly

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,800
uh fsf is dealing with the the power imbalance between

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,319
uh developers and users and that pattern balance is still visible today

00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,440
osi was dealing with a collaboration we now call the

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
collaboration problem which was basically that

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,880
free open source was very free software was not digestible to

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,119
corporates at the time what we're now dealing with and not dealing very well

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,520
is the same thing we're seeing in millennials going to work and

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,640
sort of turning their nose up working on stuff that doesn't improve the world

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,440
there's a there is a thing to fix here i don't yet know how to fix it i strongly

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,359
support the objectives that's why i advocate remaining open to change and

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,920
remain engaged but i i don't know what the solution is i

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,960
think that but yes the idea that communities that are jointly operating

00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,079
developing common software should be structuring themselves in a

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,280
way that explicitly improves the world i think is one that is worth pursuing

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,520
somehow uh jamie i take your point i on

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,800
i'm joking and preposterous i was trying i worked very hard to

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,760
focus my comments on the conduct not the people but you're quite right if you

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,079
add all that language together um it starts with that homonym i will uh

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,280
fine-tune that in further communication certainly i'm

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,680
concerned about the conduct more than other people

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,559
uh jeff uh if it was possible to make large

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,839
companies legal teams go on record about uh ethical decisions then this has value

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,720
but it's not possible for the reasons that have argued if you

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,760
try to use open door licensing as a means to control people

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,720
particularly to control large organizations their response will not be

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,440
to submit their response will be to divert their

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,680
use and their implementation resources to other projects

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,319
so it's can we make can we build systems that encourage that

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,280
yes but at the moment we try to compel and force or instead or establish

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,119
performance standards we've shot ourselves in the foot because the

00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,960
big guys the guys were seeking to control the human rights abusing states

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,800
and the somewhat ethical large corporates they'll

00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,440
just will ignore us it's not it's not a reasonable cause and

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,040
effect relationship i think i should probably stop there

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,839
