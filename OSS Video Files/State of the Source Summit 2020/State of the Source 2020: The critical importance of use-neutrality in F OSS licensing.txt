Description: 
	The critical importance of use-neutrality in F/OSS licensing
Roland Turner

Embedding exclusionary "ethical use" obligations in F/OSS licenses seems like a great idea, however it undermines both the freedom objectives of Free Software and the inclusiveness objectives of Open Source Software. I'll detail why doing this can't possibly achieve what's intended, what harm expanding the Open Source Definition to support it would do, and what cooperation between F/OSS and exclusionary communities might be possible.
