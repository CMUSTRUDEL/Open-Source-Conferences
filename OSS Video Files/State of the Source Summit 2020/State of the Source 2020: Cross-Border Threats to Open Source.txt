Description: 
	Cross-Border Threats to Open Source
Michael Guo

The open source community is global and, by definition, open. But the world is now more nationalized and closed. In particular, creeping reemergence of export controls – which were once more clearly limited to military weapons – threatens to chill our ability to share and collaborate in broad technology categories, such as AI and ML. We will explore the history of export controls, review recent rules changes in the current geopolitical climate, and mull potential solutions and predictions.
