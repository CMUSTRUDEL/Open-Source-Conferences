Title: State of the Source 2020: Cross-Border Threats to Open Source
Publication date: 2020-09-21
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	Cross-Border Threats to Open Source
Michael Guo

The open source community is global and, by definition, open. But the world is now more nationalized and closed. In particular, creeping reemergence of export controls – which were once more clearly limited to military weapons – threatens to chill our ability to share and collaborate in broad technology categories, such as AI and ML. We will explore the history of export controls, review recent rules changes in the current geopolitical climate, and mull potential solutions and predictions.

hi my name is mike guo over the next 20

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
minutes i hope to just barely scratch the

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
surface of the very broad topic of cross-border threats to open source

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,000
there's an interesting confluence of events happening in the world

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,960
i'm not just talking about the immediate everyday crises we have now that force

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,160
us to have an online only conference rather i wanna want to take us out of

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
the narrow lens of how do we get through the rest of

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
2020 instead think about the global trends

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
that have been taking place over the last few decades

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,640
that got us to this very moment then i want to introduce or as it may be

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
reacquaint you with what's been going on in the more narrow world

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,440
of export controls

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
before we get too far a quick disclaimer first

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,680
even though i am a lawyer i'm not your lawyer and this is not legal advice

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
please do check with your own competent legal counsel

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,720
second i'm speaking for myself here not on behalf of salesforce

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,600
where i work now a quick agenda slash too long didn't read

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
my overall theme is open source was nurtured

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,400
it came of age in an era of globalization and free trade

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,520
but over the last few years we've seen the trend move

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
sharply in the opposite direction i don't think it's controversial to say

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
that the world is becoming a more fractured

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
and more nationalized place with countries increasingly drawing lines in

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
the sand one of the lines being drawn is export

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,720
controls there's a recent law you may not be familiar with the

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,200
export control reform act of 2018 or ecra the ecra

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
provides a statutory basis for what the bureau of industry and security

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,680
or bis has already been doing with regard to rulemaking for so-called

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,039
emerging and foundational technologies bis which falls under the department of

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,959
commerce has been busy making new rules and many

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,720
more are to come the rules are being applied

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,959
to rather broad areas like artificial intelligence

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,200
machine learning microprocessors and data analytics now

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,319
although we generally think that source code is protected under the first

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,519
amendment as freedom of speech there are limits to

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
the first amendment if you go back and read the legal cases

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
from two decades ago the ones that actually established that

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
source code is free speech you'll find that the holdings are much

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,480
narrower than you may have remembered although we enjoy this protection now

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
i'm not convinced that we're going to have them

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
forever as a practical matter i don't think

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
there's an immediate threat perhaps not even an imminent threat to

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,200
existing open source projects but i do find the overall

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
climate and trends concerning because i think they're going to cause countries

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
and companies to be more reluctant or even

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,120
legally unable to participate in the open source community

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
before i dive into the geopolitical landscape

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
i want to provide some perspective for you these days

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
i'm an in-house patent attorney i oversee not only a patent

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
docket but also legal issues relating to open source

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,040
along with other ip issues but long ago i came of age as a web developer perhaps

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
just barely trailing what i think of as open

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,599
source is adolescent years but most importantly i'm not an export

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
control attorney there are people who actually specialize

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
in this stuff i think about export controls from the

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
perspective of someone who needs to be able to spot an

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,680
issue make a quick risk assessment and decide whether i need to call

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
someone else who actually knows something i suspect

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,959
that many of you are in the same boat you're not

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,880
an export control attorney but you do know open source

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
and that's not necessarily true for a lot of export control attorneys

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,320
you're the audience i'm speaking to so let's think more about those

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
geopolitical trends i keep on referring to

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,960
from the 1990s until about four years ago

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,000
there was a general trend of increased globalization and openness in the world

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,479
to orient ourselves 1991 marks the end of the cold war with that came the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,360
opening up of countries and economies for example nafta was signed in 1994.

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
the schengen area in europe was established in 1995.

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,479
in 2002 the eurozone moved to a single physical currency

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,000
also during this time china's economy really

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,160
took off growing at close to 10% a year has made it the second largest economy

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,320
in the world and of course this is also the time

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,840
period when the internet and world wide web

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,720
saw rapid growth and adoption worldwide then there's the last few years

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
during this time we've seen the

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,759
pendulums swing back sharply in the opposite direction barely a day

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,639
goes by without a headline relating to the

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,919
ongoing trade war with china or a new executive action being taken

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,960
that curtails free trade or freedom of movement across borders

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,600
this trend has accelerated rapidly as a result of the pandemic in

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,360
global economic recession the walls are tightening in around us while we're

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
distracted by all these other problems now against

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
this backdrop is open source i don't think it's a

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
coincidence that the first version of the gpl was released in 1989

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,240
or that the linux kernel adopted gpl v2 in 1992

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,080
or that we've seen enormous growth in open source

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,360
from the 1990s through 2000s in fact i would argue that the open

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
source community wouldn't be as successful and large as

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
it is now if it weren't for the environment in

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,919
which it's been fostered and nurtured our community thrives and goes hand in

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
hand with things like free trade and open

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
borders to borrow a famous saying information

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,199
wants to be free so what happens when that nurturing

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,360
environment that supporting foundation is taken out

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
from under us from under the open source community

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,599
there's been a spate of headlines recently that show an acceleration in

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,599
this trend like i said not a week goes by without

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,319
yet another restriction on trade in fact i bet that between the time i

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
record this presentation and the time it gets streamed we're

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
going to see yet another major headline now i admit that

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
not all these headlines relate to expert controls

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,599
but remember expert controls are only one aspect

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,919
of this increasingly harsh environment also admit that these headlines are very

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,759
us centric but let's face it a lot of our

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,120
environment really is driven by us government rule making and hey

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
it's not just the united states other countries have similar export control

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
regimes look i'm not going to go into them as

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,280
much as i'm not an expert in us export controls

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,319
i'm even less an expert on say the eu's export controls

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
but they exist and it's enough for our purposes today to understand

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,039
that they're similar it's also worth noting that the flip side of export

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
is import there are laws and regulations that

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
affect the ability to bring stuff into countries as well

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
think of the tick tock ban that's really an

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,080
import ban not an export ban but it likewise affects our ability to

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
interact across borders you can see this play out with a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,680
response to the executive orders that banned tiktok and wechat

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,520
which have nothing to do with export controls

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
china just a few days ago released new rules

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
in response to that that limit the ability to export technology

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,080
related to data processing and speech and text recognition

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,959
that's an incredibly broad category and a large escalation

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,040
of what's arguably a limited executive order

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,760
i'm highlighting this because the trend of escalating tit for tat bans

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,200
concerns me and speaking of tick tock look at the escalating border conflict

00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
between india and china and the himalayas

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,600
one very presence and real effect of that conflict

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,880
has been a ban on sharing certain technology

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
this isn't a simple us problem it really is a

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,480
global problem for a global open source community

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:26,320
so i've been using the term export a lot we should really define it an export

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
covers the situation that you're likely already familiar with

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,680
sending products out of a country but an export also covers a couple

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,480
situations you might not have expected for example sending technical data out

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,560
of the united states counts as an export and sending products or technical data

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,480
within the united states is an export too

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,600
if the recipient is a non-us citizen or isn't a permanent resident

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,079
ndas working for the same company they don't make a difference

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
for example if you send an email to someone else

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
at the same company you work at who's in the united states on a visa

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
but not a permanent resident you just exported something

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,480
under the law so you're subject to export controls

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
those export controls come from three primary sources

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
first there's itar it's focused on things like

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,959
munitions things that are more clearly military in nature

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,440
second you have the ear which is focused on dual use technologies

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
things like encryption or the things i was talking about ai

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
ml etc they can be used both for civilian

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,240
and military use and third there are u.s sanctions issued by ofac

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,880
also note that there are myriad other related laws and regulations

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
for example the atf has munitions import control regulations

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,399
there are anti-boycott regulations there's the fcpa the foreign corrupt

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,920
practices act there's CFIUS the committee on foreign

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,560
investment in the united states but we don't have time to talk about all that let's just look at the ear and remember

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
the underpinning statutory authority is the ecra

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,440
which was passed only a couple years ago so what exactly does the ear cover the

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,200
authorizing statute just refers to quote emerging and foundational technologies

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,040
well bis issued a recent rule that provides a

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
list of sample technologies that intends to

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,040
regulate as you can see the list is rather expansive

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,279
it includes some categories here that at least cause me to raise an eyebrow

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,760
for example artificial intelligence and machine learning

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,440
there's a lot of development effort these days in those areas

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,720
and a lot of ai and ml products are built

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639
on open source code and open source models

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,240
i find microprocessor technology an interesting inclusion here too

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,160
that's mainly because given the way freedom of expression works

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,040
i think the law could potentially treat hardware differently from software

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,680
even if they're both expressed as source code think about the potential creative

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,040
difference between say a hardware description and

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,920
verilog versus an encryption algorithm in c

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
how might that affect the open hardware movement

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,040
i also find data analytics technology an interesting phrase

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,600
because what is that that seems really broad

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
when you drill down into the examples for each of these categories

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,920
and these are actually in the regulations it feels even broader

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,079
under ai you can see categories like computer vision

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,639
speech and audio processing natural language processing

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,560
there's a lot of amazing open source development in these areas

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,040
i'm not convinced that microprocessor technology is a narrow category either

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,120
i mean look at the examples these are broad system on a chip

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,040
stacked memory and data analytics it includes visualization

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,079
automated analysis algorithms context-aware computing

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
that seems to cover a heck of a lot of what both

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,320
tech companies and non-tech companies do

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
so the good news is the first regulatory ban

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,959
that has come out of bis in about january of this year

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,480
based on the ecra is fairly narrow the headlines have said things like u.s

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,519
announces ai software export restrictions

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,279
recall the headline from an earlier slide but in reality

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,720
the regulation is narrowly tailored to a particular

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,399
type of geospatial imagery software it has lots of specific requirements

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,240
that i think most open source projects in the space would be unlikely to meet

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,040
and i mean i'm going to fly through the slide i know it's hard to read

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
i just want you to get the general impression of how detailed the

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
requirements are if you do actually read the regulatory

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
requirements they seem to be more about specialized

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,079
proprietary software maybe something that's developed under a

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,360
government contract not an open source project so it is

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,800
promising that the first export control rule coming out of the ecra is so narrow

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,920
but we need to keep in mind government history and the context for these

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
regulations i'm reminded of two things that i've

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,000
used and that i bet many of you have used as well

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,160
that have been subject to export controls

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,240
here we have the sony playstation 2. in 1999 bis ruled that the ps2 was

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,880
subject to export controls because there's an american-made chip

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
inside that rose to the level of a super computer

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
and it could conceivably be used by the

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,079
chinese government to simulate nuclear explosions

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,199
on the right here we have pretty good privacy pgp

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,880
the developer of pgp phil zimmerman was subject to a criminal investigation

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,360
because at the time encryption keys larger than 40 bits were

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,440
subject to export controls now there's an interesting loophole in

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,839
the regulations publications aren't subject to export

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,440
controls as a result Phi published the entire

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,240
source code of pgp in a book which could then be exported scanned in

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
via ocr and compiled into a working copy of pgp

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,839
without running a foul of the law

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,720
that loophole expanded as a result of a couple lawsuits

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,839
bernstein v u.s department of justice and younger v daily

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,040
these cases are remembered for establishing the legal rule that the

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
publication of source code is protected as free speech under the

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,360
first amendment but i encourage you to pull the cases

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,279
and to read them the case aids are right there on the

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,079
slide so you can type them into google scholar

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
every mention of these cases that i've seen refers to this expansive free

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
speech holding that source code is free speech

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,560
but if you actually read the cases you don't need to be a lawyer to do this

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,720
you'll see that the cases are actually much narrower than that

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,279
in bernstein the court said and i quote we emphasize the narrowness of our first

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,919
amendment holding we do not hold that all software is

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,600
expressive we hold merely that and now i'm

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,360
paraphrasing the particularly the particular

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,679
regulatory regime at that time constitutes an

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,039
impermissible prior restraint on speech the court also said the government can't

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,080
block ideas but it can block products and so

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,440
what unsurprisingly there's a footnote that the court added the state's

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
national security could justify a prior restraint on free

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,280
speech seriously go read the opinions i don't

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
think they actually protect what we think

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,000
they're protecting and as i read the ecra in the case law i

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
don't see those expansive protections we're

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,039
relying upon as far as i can tell the exception that

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
allows publication of source code whether it's in a book or on the

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,840
internet actually comes from the ear which is a

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,400
regulation not case law or statute

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,000
and given what we've been seeing with other rule making and executive actions

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,280
in recent years i don't think it's far-fetched to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,799
imagine a world in which a little more rule-making causes these

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
protections to disappear right because you can change the

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,120
regulations without having to pass a law it would still be limited

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,280
constitutionally but the court has already said there are

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,760
limits on the constitution's right to free

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
speech so in the end what does that mean for

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
you what if you have an open source project that's already been posted

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,440
publicly on github well i think the practical effect is

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,240
likely none it's business as usual

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,080
if you think about this pragmatically the open source code is already out

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,679
there the idea is already out there in the

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,080
wild you can't unring that bell so to speak

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,640
so it would be absurd to subject that to new export controls

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,960
that said make sure you're meeting the regulatory requirements

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
for example if you have encryption in your project

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
then there's a requirement that you send notices to a couple different government

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,120
email addresses it's pretty simple but what about the

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
future right i'm concerned about the chilling

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,200
effect the cause for the causes of

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
harm that we might not be able to prevent

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,120
look many of my past predictions haven't come to fruition i'm wrong a lot

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,799
but i think if you extrapolate from the current trends

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,080
you're going to see these trend lines continue maybe even

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,200
accelerate further this is true regardless of whatever administration's

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
office is in office next year because it goes

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,520
way beyond that generally i think there's going to be

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,039
less willingness or ability to collaborate across borders

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,799
that in turn harms the open source community remember that it's not just

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,200
the us other countries have a greater ability

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,120
to prevent exports and not all of this will be driven by export controls or

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,760
official government rule making so what can we do as a community i

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
brainstormed a few ideas and threw them on the slide

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,559
some of them are practical some of them are less so i'm open to hearing other

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
ideas of things we can try to do to mitigate

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
against these risks i'll just conclude by saying that i

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,240
don't necessarily have any solutions for you

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,679
in fact you might leave this talk truly dissatisfied

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,720
but my goal here isn't to give you a solution

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
rather i just want to increase awareness and to bring this topic to the forefront

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,000
of the conversation although there's been a little bit of

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
recent attention for example the linux foundation released a great white paper

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,960
a couple months ago it's been about 20 years since there's

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
been much discussion devoted to these topics in the tech community

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,480
and then i just firmly believe that if there are more eyes in the problem

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
then it will be less likely for this to blow up into yet another crisis

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,640
that we have to deal with and ideally if we're successful then years later

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,400
we can look back at this presentation and say hey what is the point of that

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
again

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,480
yeah and since i'm in a public chat i say mario just posted something

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
um is it only related to software do you also

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
consider hardware as you give examples um

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,000
yeah i you know honestly i'm thinking about software a lot but export controls

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
be applied to both software and hardware and one of the notes i

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,760
said earlier is that i actually kind of worry that export controls will

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
apply more strictly to hardware and not be as well protected under the law

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,799
there's something i was thinking about that borrows from copyright doctrine

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,120
which is the merger doctrine where if if there's more than

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,760
one way to express something then you can get a copyright but if

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
there's only one way to really express it then you can't get a copyright

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,640
um i don't think courts have necessarily equated that yet with how expressive

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,240
something is under the first amendment but i could see less first amendment

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,400
protection for like a very long hardware description as

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
opposed to something written in a high-level

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,240
language for software and i'm just trying to get over the fact

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,280
that i watched myself give a presentation

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,039
um oh so the sure notes there's a question much of this talk focused on

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,400
export laws from software originating from the us

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,159
uh what impact do you see at u.s export laws having on open source software

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,320
developed outside of the us eg a popular open source project developed in kenya

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,559
so you know to answer the specific the literal language of the question

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,799
there should actually be no true impact from u.s export laws

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,919
um but i can let me reframe that a little bit

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,720
because one the us lobbies other countries heavily in order to change

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
their export control laws or to change their policies their their

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
foreign policy right so huawei is a big example of that

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
and the so-called race to 5g the united states has convinced

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,600
some countries around the world in order to spurn

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,000
china right um due to potential national security

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
concerns but but something else that i'm thinking about here so there are two

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,280
other things one remember that all exports aren't import

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
so there are actually separate import restrictions

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
um you know it could be something related to the panel

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,200
it could be something else um we actually have an entire commission that

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
i used to practice before that's just built for blocking

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
imports right the us international trade commission

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,080
the other thing is you know what what makes me think about this more are the

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,720
tip for tat bans right so look at look at foreign laws as

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,120
well and that's certainly something where i'm just not

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,919
an expert in but like when after the united states

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,559
released the executive order that bans tiktok china about

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,799
a month later released something that bans something even more broad

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,480
for export right and and as the us keeps on escalating i could

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,240
see other countries escalating in response as well

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,279
um and that would limit our ability to use

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,520
foreign developed open source software right and

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,279
this is not just true for places like traditional adversaries like russia um

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,640
look at the tariff fight that's occurring with europe i know this is a

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,520
totally different topic or space but you know i saw an

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,080
article the other day about how lvmh doesn't want to buy tiffany anymore

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,200
due to the escalating trade war um between the united states and europe so

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
these things have a lot of far-reaching implications that

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
people don't necessarily expect immediately

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,320
yeah yeah so mccoy like so something that you might actually know

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,080
about related to russia is i've heard that some countries have

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,480
um or rather some companies have diversified their risk by creating

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,760
separate teams in other countries where our laws may prevent export

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
so when in my last slide when i was talking about encouraging geographic

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
diversification to manage risk that's actually what i was thinking

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,360
about because say countries start building um borders or walls that

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
prevent us from collaborating with one another

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,039
if there's development going on within a country

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,880
that can continue right so one of the ways to get around these

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
issues is to plan ahead and make sure that we're not just like getting

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
contributions for projects from one region of the world

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,320
but like maybe even duplicate effort from other regions in the world too

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,520
yeah so i i do admit a lot of this relates to china us

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,960
um at least that's the proxy by which a lot of this is being fought

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,240
yeah what options are there for lawmakers

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,919
and then maybe stopping sending microchips china can weaken or slow down

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,799
the expansion of repression but how should we deal with this in regards to

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,320
free open source software um we want to collaborate but it also gets more

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,480
difficult as they block vpns in china is all just so difficult yeah um plus one

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
to the fact that it is all just so difficult i don't even think that's an

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,320
opinion i'm calling it a fact um you know it's funny because like when

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,919
it comes to lawmakers i mean i i don't think it's

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,520
controversial to say that i don't think lawmakers understand their space

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,200
and they don't understand this either so a lot of it is really we need to talk to

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
them right and we need to submit comments for

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,240
government rule making people actually do read this stuff

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,760
even if they end up ignoring our comments in order to pass whatever

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,919
regulation they actually want to pass um

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,039
you know maybe i'm misunderstanding the question

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,200
but it's it's tough right and i i've seen some talk about how other

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,039
countries and have pointed out to the us

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,200
government that a lot of these rules just don't make

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,279
sense right like why are we dividing um products from like say publications

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:22,399
why are we parsing out um dual use items from military-only items

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,720
right because for example i understand the chinese government actually said

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
once the united states well you know everything we do is in support

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,000
of both the economy and our national defense therefore if you send anything

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,600
to china whatsoever you're going to support national defense

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,679
therefore it just doesn't make any sense to have these sorts of rules

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,880
you know how do you legislate around this and i think the us government is

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,799
struggling to figure out the right way to do it but as they're struggling

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,360
um the side effects the unintended con consequences

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,840
can be very interesting especially when it comes to something like open source

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,159
that's certainly not top of mind for our legislation

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,260
legislators legislatures thanks everyone take care

00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,000
