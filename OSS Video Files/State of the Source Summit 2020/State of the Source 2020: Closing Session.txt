00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,640

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,760
yeah and here together with me i have jenn

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,520
kathy and shaun from the organizing team um is it okay with you that i shared

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
with the audience a little bit of the background you know the

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,159
behind the scenes normally people see what happening

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
on the rail but maybe it's interesting to to talk a little bit about

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,680
the preparation for the event so um i actually took over

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
the organization of the event right after patrick

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
resigned from the osi it was in the beginning

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,560
of july it was a very challenging time for us i

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
um we did not have a staff member and then a lot of

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,680
operational work that needs to be taken care of so

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,399
um among the volunteer roles we share the responsibility and try to keep the

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
lights on for the org and we were not so sure whether we

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
should have state of the source remember i discussed with you jenn we

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,200
were not sure whether we should have it in september or we should postpone it

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
towards the end of the year or next year and then

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
patrick got me together with jenn and kathy so we have

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
the conversation and and i'd like to see whether if possible and jenn was very

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,760
confident and said okay we can make it i came back to the board and shared with

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,000
them the um uh shared um

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,879
what jenn said to me and said okay i think that we can do it and also with my

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,200
experience of organizing many events at with the foss asia summit so we decided

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,239
we stick to our timeline and at that time we did not

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
close the call for speaker we also did not get like

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
a sponsor on board it was in the beginning of july so we only have about

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
a month and a half to take care of the entire thing

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,000
and josh yes he's here so i'm pretty glad and really appreciate that he gave

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
us the chance and also appointed me as the chair and we get uh the board agreed

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
that okay we should have this event and then after that

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,640
uh jenn kathy and i even though we only met for the first time we started to

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,280
align very quickly so we have our weekly meeting on thursday the first

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
challenge was different time zones so i'm living in in

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
germany and they are both in arizona so to find a time

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
that we we can meet regularly

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,239
yeah colorado yeah and then uh so um so i um so i

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
would uh talk to them every thursday when i finished my

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
uh full-time job and then they would get up early in the morning and join the

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,200
call we distributed to work so jenn taking

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040
care of communication with a sponsor and

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,920
it is a very hard job you know only different requirements that we need to

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
offer to the sponsor and jenn throughout the

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,599
event to send out over 100 of emails a lot of communication going on until

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,120
last week yeah and kathy taking care of the

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,879
speaker communication with the speaker so um overlook of the overlaw of the

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,720
content we are live on the technical uh issue what to use what

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,680
system to use and i understand that for for jenn and

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
kathy this is also the first time that they have to

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
um try out so many open source systems open

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,680
new tools you know and i know that you you two organize a lot of events but

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,720
this is like a very special crowd right and i just want to say that i was so

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,080
happy to work together with you yeah so it's really

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
grateful i remember that we we even listened on a sunday

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
i think just last sunday and sometimes we we caught

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
we called kathy when she was out together with her children

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,800
in the restaurant yeah a lot of things uh behind the scene and um what else i

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
want to say uh so jenn has an idea that we should make

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
a promotion video for the event just a few weeks before

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,479
and you know that we are not professional video

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,960
maker so jenn came up okay let's do a script and three of us

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
from three different time zone arranged together that we make a clip

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,440
and then put them together and so so we have the promotion video

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,759
um for the event what else that i uh um maybe it's in and um

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,360
yeah big blue button the first time we we use big blue button uh

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,380
jenn maybe you can share about your experience

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,640
well i have a little bit of experience with bigbluebutton

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,240
with another organization that we work with um but only

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
as a user and in the context of basically like weekly meetings

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
so very basic you know six or eight people

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,560
and honestly we actually only use the audio bridge for it so

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,880
we um we had to dig in and rummage around and figure out what features

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,120
we had what constraints we had um the uh the folks at blindside uh

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,319
networks um up there in ottawa they um do a lot of support and um development

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,400
for big blue buttons so i uh called them a few times actually on

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
the telephone you know like old school because

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,880
i was like hey i need help so um yeah it was

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,600
uh it was um a ton of fun um and it was definitely uh

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
there was a pretty steep learning curve to make sure that we were using the

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,520
right tools um and you know meeting the the needs of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,440
the the group um so it was um it's been a ton of fun but it has

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,440
been fast and furious no lie yeah how about kathy do you want to share

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
anything what is uh the difference between this event and

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,000
all the events that you organized by the way i realized that you have

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,240
become eventyay expert user yes this was my first introduction to

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,919
event yay um it was it was a little bit

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
challenging in the beginning but i i feel pretty confident whipping around in

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,199
there now um the conference has been great i i

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
love my favorite part about organizing the

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,880
conferences is getting to the end where we get to put a face

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
to all of the names that we've been working with over the last few months

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
the speakers um especially you guys have worked so

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,199
hard and i appreciate all of the effort you've put into

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
creating the videos and then being present

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
watching yourself present i know a couple people mentioned that was

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
very very strange watching themselves present

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,000
on the sidelines um so that's that's always my favorite part of the

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,680
conference and i really enjoyed it um this time around as well

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160

bigbluebutton and normally i use a lot of

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,199
open source programming and software to make my job a lot easier and a lot

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,360
quicker and i always enjoy just helping you guys

the event i like to figure out um how to do the

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,440

and also so thank you very much for that i saw that you already put up um the thank you

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,120
message to our sponsors

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,320
yeah uh jen would you like to add something here

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,680
as you have a close connection with a sponsor throughout

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
um it was fantastic to have so much support

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
um and enthusiastic support i should say there was

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,440
um it was just quick when when the call went out we

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
had nearly every one of these um organizations responded very very

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
quickly um as hong said um it is a challenge each

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
of the organizations has um you know different requirements

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,680
for um addendums and um

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,760
wording and you know those kinds of things to go into the agreement and so

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
we had to work our way through each of those uh but

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
you know yeah couldn't be more excited and

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
um and happy about the number that we had without

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,320
these these organizations i don't know that we could have done this event

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
i mean their financial support as well as their

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
support in general with you know speakers and bofs and

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,320
hallways and all of those good things i think it really

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
was a critical piece of making this event come off

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,800
yeah josh would you like to say something on behalf of

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,519
the osi to to our sponsors i would love to um

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,800
none of this would be possible but for our sponsors

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
um the the sponsors who really underwrite

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,240
all the all the vendor contracts you know both

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,880
uh for the captioning for the hosting for just really every aspect of this you

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,639
know we couldn't do without our sponsors um and i you know i was not so

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,320
intimately involved in the process uh but i i got a similar you know

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,279
recognizing the timeline that this was organized on and that the call for

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,600
sponsors went out when it did it really is a credit to the sponsors

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,959
and how uh how much support there was for this

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
event and how quickly they wrangled their

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,760
you know all those unique po systems and whatever their unique requirements were

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,480
like that takes hustling to get done get

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,839
through those systems uh this quickly so just endless gratitude to our

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,560
sponsors but really the reason i'm here is not

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,800
just to thank our sponsors i'm actually here to uh to

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,839
i'm here to thank hong phuc um because you know i think hong phuc set the set

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
the context a little bit you know patrick uh patrick was our

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,399
general manager he resigned in in july um and you know he's still working

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
with us but folks we're in the leadership session no

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,839
like you know we're still one big family but um patrick is the only full-time

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,480
staff member of was osi's only full-time staff member and

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,360
to lose him while this planning for this event was in flight was

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,680
uh was really challenging um and so you know both a credit to to kathy and

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
jan and shaun and just you know all the vendors we work with on

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,720
this to to pull us through but above all above all

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,199
i really think we all owe hong phuc dang an extraordinary debt of gratitude

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,800
for putting this event together because not only was she the chair for this

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
event she was the vice president of the open

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,560
source initiative and her and i were alternating weeks taking over the

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
general manager's duties so uh there were times in the last

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,959
couple months when hong phuc was doing two and three different jobs all at once

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,560
i know this is a labor of love um i know uh

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,920
hong phuc doesn't always like it when i i shower her with praise

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,120
but uh but honestly the fact that we're all here

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
today this is this is this is you're doing hong phuc

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,079
and i i hope uh i hope you're proud of your work i sure am

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,920
so uh thank you hong phuc

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
it was my pleasure i'm really happy to do it

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,120
and i would love to do it again if jenn and kathy and shaun are also on board

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,440
so um yeah thank you as well the the audience yeah so we checked out

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,800
every session for the engagement and i must

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,920
say that we have a very good level of audience engagement compared to many

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,160
events that i participated during the last few months so thank you very

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,720
much for your enthusiasm and for your contribution to

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,199
the conference and uh just i just want to go quickly

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
some of the lessons learned that we have and also maybe give

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,279
the audience the chance to give us any feedback that we can

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,560
improve for the next event so kathy will be sending out a survey

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,160
asking for feedback from you but um this is now the opportunity if you want to

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,639
give us any direct feedback please do so um

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,639
shaun could i ask you to um unblock everyone

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,759
if they want to say something everyone is

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,639
okay very good so um what i like i can say like the good

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,880
thing about the event uh in my opinion opinion compared to the

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,160
physical event i think that uh it's really good that we

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,880
have the shared notes function so we can engage the audience

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
and keep track of all the questions everything will been public

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,000
at the end normally in a physical event sometimes we don't have

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,800
enough time to do to address all the questions and people often are

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,360
very shy they don't like so vocal about asking the speaker directly

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
but like having it online i think the the

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,040
level of engagement also increased and all the notes

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
that have been taken during the event will be sent to the osi board and we

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
will for sure taking action on those

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
yeah um maybe extrapolate can go to see what a

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
good thing that we that we find about having the event online

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,000
and then i can also the audience can also jump in

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
one of the things i'm finding with online events that i think is the most

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,919
exciting and we've touched on it on in other sessions is just the um the

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
accessibility of them and the way it allows people to

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,799
come and participate and actively engage in

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,480
ways that they wouldn't normally if we were in say somewhere in north

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,039
america um hong you mentioned travel visas

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,480
and time and costs i mean there's just there's so many barriers to

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
an in-person event now i i love in-person events i've been

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,160
managing them for 18 years so i love them but i think that this is

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,400
a piece that really um has suffered you know and

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,679
we haven't had as many voices involved so um

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
i think that that is one of the huge upsides and i really saw that here i

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
mean the statistics that hong shared earlier

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
about you know every continent in 43 countries

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,559
and i i think that is so so cool and um

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,520
there's so many conversations that have come out of the sessions that i was in

00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:15,880
that josh you guys have a lot of work to do

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
so that's very exciting

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,919
yeah so i saw some comments saying that plus one to the

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,720
single track layout yeah yeah so so so i think that uh we did

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
uh pretty good well with the scheduling even though i hope that

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
next year i also thinking perhaps we have some break in between so that we

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
can cover um all the time zone as well so now we

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
have a session back to back right the entire

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,960
day on the eastern time zone uh some people especially in australia

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
it's difficult for them to participate we got that feedback as well

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
perhaps we can do like some break in between the

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,880
session yeah we do know that then yeah

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,200
um any other good sign from kathy do you have

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
something to share

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,240
i think i mean what jenn touched on i think is is definitely the most value of

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,440
the um online conferences just the

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
accessibility and the ability to have such a diverse group

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,080
of people easily collaborate together um where

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,520
it's it's just not so easy to do so in person

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,960
um i'm not sure if i have anything else to add at this point but

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
it's it's been a lot of fun

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,919
yeah so i i saw that we also collecting a bunch of notes

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,559
during the the last few days yeah we for sure could uh work on though

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,000
and improve for the next uh our next event um let me see if there is

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,960
anything else from the audience yeah so they all had a lot --

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,840
um and josh uh so jenn already pointed out to you that we

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,960
have a lot of work to do and what are the plans to follow up

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,520
on these uh topics this is this is one of the things that i've

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,159
really loved uh about my time with osi and and i

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,400
gotta say it's it's it is challenging and outrageously time

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,200
consuming but here's here's what i've really loved

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
about serving in this capacity with with you

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
um is that you know not only is the work important

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,640
i think you know obviously we're here because we think it's important we

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,080
wouldn't be otherwise um but this is work that is

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
appreciated and people are passionate about it

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,039
you know the thing that that i always you know come from a community

00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,919
management background and a community organizing background

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,480
and in my my philosophy is that

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,840
whether somebody is angry or critical or happy and gushing with praise

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,120
usually you hear less of the praise than you would want but no matter what if

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,360
you're hearing from people at all they care they care and

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
i would so much rather be serving a community that

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,240
cares than a community that's like oh yeah osi is over there they're just

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,760
they're going to do whatever and you know fine we're not that interested

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,159
like just the fact that so many people showed up

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,080
that we had so many uh so many different perspectives

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
not all of them were in align with each aligned with each other we did have

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
differing perspectives that were sometimes at cross purposes

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
but i think that's healthy i think that's really a sign of just

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,159
how vibrant the the communities that we we participate in and serve

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,840
are um and how vigorous uh and lively the discussions are around

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
sort of where where have we been and where are

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,760
we going um so i'll say we we got a lot of positive

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
feedback we got a lot of critical feedback not just

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,080
on on you know specifics of like how we write our first event but just about osi

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
as an organization itself and i think that's probably what was alluded to

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,440
and we do have a lot of work to do and you know over the last several years

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
osi has really been under a microscope with the

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
resurgence and source available licensing and things like that and

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,880
and uh sort of a not just not a resurgence but just the

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,520
ethical sourcing like blooming into the stage

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,960
um you know osi has been under a microscope and

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,200
so we've we've received a lot of input and feedback over the last couple years

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,240
and it's all been useful and it's informing the plans that we're making

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,520
for the future but i gotta say all of it was really distilled into two days here

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,559
um and and really really effectively um so i think you know as i alluded into

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,039
in my keynote and in the leadership panel earlier

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,880
today osi needs to finish its governance

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,679
reform needs to finish its strategy setting process needs to hire

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,200
what i termed a small but mighty staff because for us to really be the

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,360
organization that the community wants what's going to take staffed on we need

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,880
people who are paid to do this work um because there's not enough not enough

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
hours of the day to do this on a volunteer basis

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,440
so just be looking for communications from us

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,799
uh be looking for opportunities to participate in in discussions and

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,320
working groups and because this well this year 2020 is

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,159
um you know osi doing a lot of self-work this is in the lead up to 2021 when we

00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,279
need to do a lot of work as a community and we're going to need your voice as a

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
part of that so the work isn't done

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,600
it'll never be done uh but we do have a couple of very critical years in our

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,760
hands and i'm just so grateful that everybody's here to be a part of that

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,799
so thank you yes so we have the promise from the

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,520
president all the comments and feedback will be addressed

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,320
by osi yes so matt

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,520
i saw your comment about telegram actually we just realized

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,360
people requesting their communications and channels so we just set out that

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,840
