Description: 
	How to Avoid "Open Source" Traps
Peter Zaitsev 

With Open Source software preferred by many engineers and executives it is not surprising we see a lot of software which is marketed as having something to do with Open Source software, but not providing all (or any) advantages which true Open Source software provides. In this talk we will look into types of not-quite Open Source software, and provide guidance on how to spot it, how to avoid traps, and pitfalls such software can bring.

hello everyone my name is peter zaitsev and i am ceo of

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,080
percona and i am going to talk to you about avoiding open source

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,400
in quotes uh traps but before we get to that i wanted to talk about uh

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,439
how did we get here and what is that

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,320
open source in quotes is and how is it different from

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,360
their open source proper now in the very early days hardware

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,320
and software they're bundled right for all kind of

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,160
uh different reasons and the source code was shipped with that

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,960
earlier software which was distributed because that software could run only

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,240
with a hardware right that was you know very

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
proper hardware at that time there was really a little point

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,240
in uh in uh hiding resource code while sharing source code allowed the

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,840
early adopters of those software hardware systems to

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
modify the code to fix bugs add functionality they need and so on

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
and so forth and also because the early adopters

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,560
a lot of them their their universities software was really shared

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,880
according to academic principles of sharing knowledge which for

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,079
centuries what actually very similar to the open source is

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,759
for for software now uh in the 70s uh

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,399
we have uh the first uh software unbundling uh taking place

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,039
right in some sources uh that is an ibm in others it was due to the pressures of

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
uh uh at&t and a breakdown but the point uh

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,200
is uh what the hardware and the software was unbundled as one important change and

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,560
the other is software because it came with

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,519
copyrightable item in us at least right and it's maybe hard

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,400
to believe now but before that computer software was not really

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
something what you could uh could copyright right it was not on the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,560
list of uh copyrightable things the first two

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
events the multi-billion dollar software

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,760
industry was created and the proper software has

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,400
become the major class of uh intellectual

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,480
uh property right and i would say software as a whole uh period to more

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,640
property software in the 80s and 90s we have an era of

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
romantic open source software and free software

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
right richard stallman displayed on this picture

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,519
preferred the free software and the free software foundation was

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
i would say the early champions in this space

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
the open source initiative started a little bit

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,840
uh later when you can uh in a february 1999 by bruce perens

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,959
and eric raymond which you can see on on this pictures

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,879
another great illustration of that era for me

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,680
at least is uh described by those uh few words

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,599
uh from linus torvalds creator of linux of course where when he was

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
talking about how he came to create linux so he

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,799
thought that was just for fun i think that is a

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,360
very important to know what in in those years

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
their majority of the open source movement was

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,520
created by people who really did it for fun right or

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,720
for their values not particularly as a way to uh

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,560
make their money retire yan retire reach by yacht and so on and

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,199
so forth now this is also in the end of 90s as

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,400
when i got first involved with open source i was both

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,320
studying in the university in moscow state university when you

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,120
you were exposed to a lot of early days open source such as linux operating

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
system uh apache and a few others

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,080
as well as i had my own startup called spylog at that time which was

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,120
built on the open source software and it could not have existed without

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,680
open source software at that time because really we did not

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,680
have any uh money to buy a license software as an oracle and we

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
need a database right or some sort of property operating system

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,680
as solaris or windows well uh actually we could

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,199
because that was russia and in russia you could buy

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,320
any software for just you know couple of dollars on

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,960
cd but that wouldn't be very legal of course

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
now if you look at open source or software it of course provides a lot of

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
values for developers which are not related to

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,479
its cost like for example open source allows you to understand

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,120
software much better because you have access to its source code

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
this is for example very important for us at percona

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,240
we never could uh support the property database like oracle when

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,440
the same quality as we can do for mysql postgres or mongodb because

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
we don't have access to resource code then just access to binary

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,919
makes it very hard to figure things out open source also allows collaboration

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,319
with other developers which is often very exciting and valuable for

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
developers which are passionate about the code right you can actually

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,199
look at the code and uh provide the improvements

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,440
not just ideas right or bug reports as you could

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
with property software that also increase the speed of innovation because

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
frankly if you're not happy with how quickly open source project

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,599
innovates and moves you can always uh to contribute yourself

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,880
and get things you need faster and finally open source project gives

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
you their uh fantastic community

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,599
right i think the open source uh communities that tend to be

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,400
much more supportive friendly and larger than communities for a lot of

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,360
opens or other property software if you look is in 2000s that is

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,479
the era where the open source becomes much more mainstream and if that

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,680
it gets benefits of up ups and downs right the linux

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,639
was recognized as a great enemy of a microsoft

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,520
at that time we all know those days microsoft is all about open source of

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,000
course but that was not the case in

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,639
early 2000s and steve ballmer would compare linux to cancer and also that is

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
where we had some uh great uh successes

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,360
in mid to late 2000s the mysql was acquired what looked like a huge

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
evaluation of billion dollars at that time now we have number of open source

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,440
companies which are pushing or exceeding 10 million dollars

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
in valuation but at that time that was

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,600
a huge vote of confidence for open source with that in the same time

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
we have seen what the value of the open source

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,200
was understood by business a number of companies have been

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,600
embracing the open source first approach right where they would see open

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,800
source as uh strategic uh

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
initiative very critically important for their company to

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,640
uh to be successful now what is interesting if you look at the open

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
source from business you can see a lot of values

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,560
which relate to their lower cost first and foremost short term long term

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,279
as well as reducing reducing risk of potentially higher cost

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,640
now first is of course directly lower cost if you

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,240
look at even uh looking at commercially supported open source software it

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,160
techn is typically cost less than proprietary

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,480
engineers also uh likes uh open source right and there are often

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
more open source familiar with open source software especially those days

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,120
which uh reduces cost in a certain extent you also get a

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
better productivity through things like better community or

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
ability to understand software better faster

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,200
innovation and also avoiding vendor lock-in which

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
is very important because even if you have open source and

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
closer solutions have a technically the same

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,000
price the leverage their uh property vendor

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,240
a software vendor would have on you is obviously much higher than if

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,079
uh uh open source software especially a truly open source software

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,560
what that created is of course we got the new generation

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,120
of open source companies was started right a new generation of open source

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,920
companies came uh and these are they're

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,720
really companies which uh they're built as a businesses from the ground up

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
right the founders recognize that there is a market opportunity and they

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
can uh really build a successful company out

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
there and uh you know

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
make a very good limit from that a lot of those companies

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,240
are venture funded and they have to provide a higher returns and

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,880
fast no matter the cost and this is which created the category

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,839
which is i'm referring as an open source in the quotes

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,800
which is about uh taking the uh advanced uh the messaging of open

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
source which is understood as a very attractive

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,800
having a high value right companies uh those they tend to

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,399
love open source and would prefer open source

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,959
to property software everything being equal

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,639
but then also apply the kind of common business principles which you

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
would learn in a business school right hey how do you build monopoly

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,240
avoid conversation increase stickiness build anti-competitive modes log in your

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,440
customers and so on and so on for so forth right

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,920
many of those would actually conflict with the vision and value of a romantic

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,240
open source now what is interesting is if you look at

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,600
the classical dilemma between the open source and property

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,760
software you would often have to choose between what you want to

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,560
optimize for for maximize distribution and maximize monetization

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,240
right for example permissively licensed open source

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
software is really great for maximizing distribution because

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,720
anybody can use it for any reason inside their property software if you

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,040
have to and so on and so forth right and then copy left license comes with

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,800
more restrictions source available licenses even more and

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,600
then all the way to a property software which maximizes

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,959
monetization for a vendor but does not really have the same uh

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,279
attributes which which increase the distribution as the open source

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
software has and i think that is where uh you uh

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
see their attempt fest open source in a quotes to see

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,480
how to get out of this office cycle and i think what you need to consider or

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
think about in the open source software is uh

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,279
the governments and related aspects now some open source projects

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,600
they would have some so sort of foundational community

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
which is responsible for steering the upstream

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,839
uh project right which cases are linux kubernetes uh

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,480
you know drupal postgres right and uh and many others now those upstream

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
for communities of foundations they really offer

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
commercial solutions so even in those cases

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,560
if you are the commercial enterprise you often end up dealing with

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
vendors which uh may even have their own

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,199
distribution like happens in case of of kubernetes

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,720
or linux right if you uh are commercial uh uh like a if you're a big

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,639
enterprise looking for linux you probably would not

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,959
uh look at uh trying to run the upstream directly but you'll work with red hat

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,560
susie canonical right or others to run their commercially supported uh

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,120
support distributions right so that is there uh we have a vendor which i

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
believe for most last scale open source software

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,040
users existence plays very important role even

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,920
if uh software uh itself has an open source uh

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,800
have an open foundation community based governance okay so then this talk about

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,760
the open source uh if and without quotes you can think about that as a two big uh

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,519
buckets right open source without quotes right in the open source in substance

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,839
and then there is open a lot of variants open source in quotes where

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:45,920
open source storms is used for marketing while not really being truly open source

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,079
what i would consider as a truly open source software now the open

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,680
source is not really you know trademark term right it's more like

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,160
natural versus organic there people can have an open source uh

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,240
different things as they choose without actually getting in there

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,199
in the legal trouble but in this case at the same time if you

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,959
really want to have a screed street cred uh recording your software of open

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,920
source you can uh uh comply with one of those

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,160
free

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,440
definition right osi from open source definition

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,040
by open source initiative gnu software which talks about the free software

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,680
which is uh i will uh i may

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,040
offend some highliners but i will use this as an interchargeably with

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,680
open source software and also debian uh for a very long time had their social

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,920
contract guidelines which really uh describe uh the problems of software

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,559
which can be included in debian which is a very much

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
open source software if you look at more details and

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,559
definition you can see uh free software defined

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,039
through those four essentials freedoms and i like it

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,280
because it's very small

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,439
you can actually easily feed it to the slide

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
if you look at the open source definition

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,960
it's much longer more and more detailed right so i only put a

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
headlines of that definition here in the slides

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,520
and provide you a link about what is

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,840
that really means so anyway if you comply to one of those software

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,960
definitions then uh your software is either

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
open source software or free software well

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,400
anyway good stuff now let's look at not quite open source

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,120
software now this open this is a kind of uh

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,559
software which often may be referred in a you know marketing

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,840
literature or somewhere else as an open source right or in a casual

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,559
conversations but it does not really provide

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,600
all of those open source uh value so here are

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,480
uh some of the variants of uh such software now if you look at that

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,520
how many variants of the open source uh software there is uh

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,600
exists or uh to all the details of the open source

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,039
governance licenses right you will find what that

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,400
is pretty complicated and

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,039
i like to uh distill that for myself uh like for us uh

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,600
you know recommendation to our customers and users is uh

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,200
to really uh if you when you are considering some software

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,880
which may be open source or open source in quotes right or one of

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,160
almost or kind of open source software is to see uh to ask a vendor

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,360
or maybe yourself the following questions

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
which really can help you to understand what is your

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,440
position really the first thing is uh the license right not all

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:53,440
open source is created equal right or for your um for your needs

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
and you need to check if a license fits well for what you are trying to do

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,679
like for example copy left licenses may not fit

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,960
right or some of a new generation uh the shared source licenses may be quite

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,679
good if you are building a website but not

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,080
work for you if you are trying to build like a database as a service solution

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,159
right stuff like that another question i would like to ask is about the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,720
commercial relationship right if you have a commercial

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,960
relationship with defender what happens if you stop that commercial relationship

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,320
in many cases the answer would be well you know you are running our

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,000
enterprise version of a software or something hey you'll have to

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,360
uninstall that and so on and so forth in other cases

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,720
you may have uh your services kind of disconnected from a

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
software and you may say well you know what

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,159
you can still run our software but now you're on your own

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,360
or it may be something else but you better

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,960
know what is it the next question is to understand what are the

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
alternatives to software or as well as to that

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,080
commercial relationship what you have in some cases

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,760
you have a lot of alternatives in other cases you

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,760
don't have any so for example in a database world i come from

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,400
the postgresql is uh is the best for customer in this case

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
because there are so many companies out there which

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,480
provides some sort of support and services around postgres

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,720
and so if you don't like one of them don't like value it provides you can

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
find a lot of a lot of choice in other cases you may

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,640
practically have only only one vendor

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,039
right which is uh of course uh additional risk and uh probably higher

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,240
prices another thing i think i think is

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,000
important is to understand can you contribute right because uh

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,960
if a vendor is not innovating in a software in a direction you would like

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
or if a speed would like do you have a choice of doing

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,799
uh that work yourself or hiring somebody to

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,720
write those features for you right or it's no it's not not possible

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,080
some vendors for example are more open than others

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,960
in accepting contributors or also their monetization strategy may

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,400
uh be something which prevents them to accepting of some of the features as

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
open source so find it out okay

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,000
with that let us move to the open source traps

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,480
right really the traps of open source in clouds traps

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,200
the first one is the most simple one the open source compatible

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,000
software there is a lot of software and i think

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,039
especially in the cloud as a database as a server which refers

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,960
to itself as open source compatible

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,440
yes let's say amazon aurora may refer what it is

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:31,280
compatible with open source databases such as mysql

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,840
or postgres now you have to understand what that comparability means though

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,440
in most cases it is the limited what i would call the hotel

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,640
california comparability meaning what it is comparable in a way

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
it's uh is very much focused on having people running open source technology

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,840
being able to run on this proprietary technology not so

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,000
easy to get out in fact uh

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,440
most likely all the uh business uh is structured around how to

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,799
make you to use the features which exist out there

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:20,000
which are only available in in this open source compatible version

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,520
right but not open source version so you will

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:31,520
uh be sticky and not leave now what do you

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,279
want to do to avoid this kind of trap and look in many cases running those

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,840
open source uh compatible versions especially in the cloud is a very good

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,080
practical choice especially for small teams right because

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,240
they can really uh do a lot

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,159
of stuff for you right so you can focus on

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,960
on building your application but now if you want to be sure uh what you

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,720
are uh have a choice of going back you want to make sure what you are doing

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,880
a full test and validation on both original open

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,360
source software and and so-called compatible version and

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,080
make sure in this case it is not just what you are not using this

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,320
special functionality but also what uh uh performance

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,760
matches your needs and expectations or you're not relying on some

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,159
management features right which uh only exist in

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,159
that property reversal right because i have seen so many people uh which

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,960
would say well you know what it's in general our application can run

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,400
on postgres and also amazon aurora postgres but you know what

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,679
we are very non-comfortable setting up for monitoring

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,240
backups have ability for uh the uh open source version well

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,400
now in this case uh that means you can't really

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,720
run it on original open source and unless you invest

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,840
more time and figure it out your team your education

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,799
and so on and so forth

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:26,159
the open core that is another uh the model what open core

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
means is what where it exists more or less

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,679
a crippled open source software version of

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,440
of software product and also the real thing

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,480
which is uh available after under property license and uh

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
right that is what company tries to sell at least that is a message you would get

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,039
from those companies sales teams now in the community you would often

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,559
hear what the open source version is you know is

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,760
good enough and so on and so forth right and in fact the success of many open

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,039
source companies really depends a lot of being

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,320
maintaining that balance what majority community

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,120
really loves the open source version and it provides them everything they need

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,919
while uh also their uh you know enterprises right and other players with

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
uh ability to pay they value what that real

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,600
thing uh provides now what is things to

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,159
consider in relationship to their uh open core one is what innovation

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,559
is going to be uh restricted as a vendor would likely have certain

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
features sometimes referred as resource features

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,799
which we want to be reserved for their property reversion

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,399
and which will not be accepted even if contributed

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,640
by community right for example with mysql

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,720
we add at your corner provide open source alternatives for number of

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,600
features which only available in proprietary

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,520
mysql enterprise version and we would be very happy to contribute them uh

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,399
upstream right we don't want to maintain more stuff

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,919
but of course oracle is not interested in that because

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,000
well they want uh people to be

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,399
seeing the value of their proprietary version right now what is a very good

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,360
thing about open core is what in this case

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,240
uh their community version is typically very uh well maintained and high quality

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,520
because it serves as a base of an enterprise

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,080
version right so uh if

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,120
opens if a community version works well for you

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,880
then that is their fantastic choice the thing you need to understand though

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,640
is to what extent community version is good enough for you now

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,559
and in the future needs in many cases the future needs are important because

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,919
uh for example as large company a company

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,559
becomes larger it may uh need some additional security

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,320
auditing compliance features right and so on and so forth

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:27,360
which are often where uh their open core vendors sort of get you

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,360
right because those are not available in open source and also check if there

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,960
are truly open source alternatives exist for

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,880
those proprietary features in certain cases there

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,720
are some uh forks or open source projects where

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,919
you can actually get uh this third-party alternatives very

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,640
open source or even if a proprietary that reduces the

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,360
leverage right because if you just have uh

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,480
uh one vendor where you can supply you if with a software you need

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,960
then you don't have choice right you have no choice if there is

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
even one alternative your situation is much

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,120
better the next one is source available licenses now the

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,039
source available is really very broad class of licenses

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,600
which provides their access to view

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,799
the license of a source code but anything else is up in the air

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,240
right it does not uh conform to fully the open source of the norms

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and standards but in what way it may be you know just one little thing

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
that may be a lot of stuff right like uh for example source

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,799
available license class maybe something as a you know shared source

00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:02,880
which you know microsoft uh you know released some software under uh

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,080
uh like decade or so ago which provides relatively little value to

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,399
something as a mongodb sspl which while it does not

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
provide you all the value of open source uh

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,000
software it's uh if you're not a cloud vendor it

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,080
really gives you a lot like for example uh it still allows

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,440
percona to provide your corner server for

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,799
mongodb which is our enhanced and uh

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,640
frankly competing uh solution now what you need to do if you're

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,039
looking at the shared service license is make sure to

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,880
evaluate a license yourself like a hyrule lawyer

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,000
right or really trusted a third party evaluation

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,120
because if you uh look at the vendor they're of course motivated to

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,559
explain what their license is you know kind of

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,159
good for you right to maximize adoption of a software

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
right and understand uh the restrictions and conditions

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
where they are okay for you or not as i mentioned

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,880
it will uh depends right and uh also uh

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,880
point out what the intent of many modern shared source licenses is to retreat

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,360
restrict competition one way or another in some cases it is

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
uh specifically targeted on the cloud

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,320
vendors right where a lot of i would say the

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,679
open source action is happening right now in other cases it

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,480
may be preventing any other commercial vendors to be able to uh

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,679
provide you help support modify the code right or

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,840
whatever but in both cases they are kind of focused on

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,320
creating some sort of uh advantage for vendorite or even

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,960
monopoly which will mean a high cost to you

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,200
compare if that would not exist now a shared source license is a

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
proprietary license and use that as a baseline for

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,159
your expectations i think that is a very uh

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,080
good uh rule to follow chances are it's not going to be as bad and much

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,240
better right and i also suggest to consider

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,519
impact on your customers and partners because

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:39,440
if you are redistributing shared source uh license the software where maybe

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,919
impacts uh downstream right because let's say uh for example

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
sspl software well you can't get it on many cloud

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,559
marketplaces right so while you may be able to do

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,880
stuff uh yourself it's uh

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,960
it restricts how usable that software is in the context of

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,279
partner relationships and of course evaluate alternatives for exist maybe

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,200
which does not uh which are open source and doesn't

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,879
come with that level of restrictions

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,440
open source eventually this is class of source available

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,399
licenses right if you be uh specific uh which has an interesting

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,599
property what it reversed to a fully open source

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,320
after a period of time i think the most well-known license

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,760
of this class is bsl or called like a business source license

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,560
which is uh you know

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,720
brought to market by marie dv corporation and since france has been

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,399
uh adopted by some other companies such as

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,880
uh cockroaches in this case the promise is uh really fantastic saying hey you

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,880
know what if you can get it fully open source

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,720
isn't that great if it becomes open source in a period of

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,280
time let's say three years well the problem

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,000
in this case is what the three years or which is the typical

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,640
time i've seen chosen is a long time

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,960
in the modern world and by that time that source

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,359
which software becomes open source tend to be

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,280
unsupported and

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,200
outdated including what is the most important the security fixes

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,040
which is especially those days is absolutely

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,200
essential for uh for all of us right so that means what by the time an

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,280
open source uh this version gets to open open source

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,359
they uh pretty much are unsafe to use

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,280
right now in theory you can argue well you know what if

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,040
a community wants it they can fork that outdated

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:14,400
uh version right and support it buy it uh uh practice it really happens

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,880
right because why would you do that instead of you know focusing on their

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,560
you know bleeding edge uh uh current stuff

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,119
right so in this case while opinion and different people

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,560
uh people vary i think for users their uh open source eventually such as

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,280
bsl license software actually of a worse value for users

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,839
compared to the uh the open core their things are

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,720
sort of much more black and white and the software you get the community

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,160
software is very fresh patched uh maintained

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,800
supported and so on and so forth so as you have a proprietary software

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
just know what you're getting uh getting into

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,920
in my opinion now with that let's cover a couple of other

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,760
interesting things which uh can happen in open source

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,560
software one thing is a question of availability

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,960
of the open source software let's say this uh the open source just say what

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,280
the source is available right so for example you have a

00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:39,760
repository on github or other place right

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,119
but now that source

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,520
doesn't have to be accessible to everyone

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,520
and the only source what the open source is about

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,000
so for example you may have a source code to be provided

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,880
only to uh only to your customers right in theory if you give somebody uh

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,480
the open source software they can redistribute that

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,200
but customers really do right especially if you look at larger customers

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,280
and they know what the vendor didn't intend them to

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
redistribute stuff they typically just you know keep it

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,240
also the binary distributions may be provided to customers only

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,320
but that is another uh thing you should look uh uh should look

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,200
into right because losing access to the binaries is even if a open source is

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,160
available that's can be inconvenient right for

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,119
production production use so that is another thing i would uh

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,520
consider and also even things like build and test may not be available in

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,079
open source that is not requirement even some of the most uh

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,320
open projects right in popular projects uh sqlite which is not even

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,760
open source right it kind of goes beyond that having

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,640
the software in the public domain but the test suite is with

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,680
where the kind of complete one is uh not available in the

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,960
public right and that is really the ipv the company uh company

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,119
health right so you need to understand what

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,280
those things are in addition and

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:53,040
uh the software which is considered fully open source and

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,119
rightfully so may have uh some of those restricted availability

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,000
right so open source license doesn't really

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,640
mandate the easily availability for uh for everyone especially for

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,040
builds and ensure what you're getting

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,200
is enough for your needs i also wanted to

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,160
mention another

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,040
trap or no trap the model for open source software

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,000
it's called open saas open software as a service

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,800
which uh the model is what open source is available for those who want to

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,319
do it themselves run it themselves but there is also

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,960
easy to use saas solutions for those who want to save time

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:57,440
and money right now in this case uh it is a great for a lot of software

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,319
because in a modern world a lot of software

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,359
is being consumed in a software as a service model right so saas is

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,920
growing very rapidly the challenge uh what exists of that is to what extent

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,520
it is for real i think many projects advertise

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,240
themselves and following that's open saas model where we use that term

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,560
directly or not but in many cases there are still some

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,480
components which are being software as a service

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,440
only and not available uh uh

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,880
if you are doing you kind of do it your self-employment uh

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,560
development and that is of course uh absolutely fine

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,599
but just uh or you have to understand those components are and what you're

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,319
relying on if you want to there uh avoid

00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:01,359
log in with that i wanted to finish

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:08,400
to by uh inviting you all to their open source database conference

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,880
we will run in late october

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,079
if you're interested in open source database

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,920
in particular that is a free online event

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,240
which you may want to attend uh check it out and with that

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,720
i am happy to answer your questions thank you for attending

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,400
okay yeah thank you i'm uh glad what i stick the time on my recording so

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,839
you can make up some of the time uh with a late uh uh late finish

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,599
uh of the previous talks and uh thank you for

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,440
all the wonderful discussion uh we had uh

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,200
so far now to the question which came in shared notes i'm not sure

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,119
who is asking that because well it doesn't show but anyway the

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
question is uh have you seen any helicopter open

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,520
source software projects which never allow customer independence

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,200
and my answer is no i haven't seen that and

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,920
i think it's good to see in what case that helicopter open

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,720
source is really used right like if you um i think the example

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,599
most close to me is oracle doing that if uh with mysql

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,640
in all the cases they are doing that for their business reasons

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,920
for example they do not want to make things easy for

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,960
folks like marie db to cherry pick security fixes for example right or

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,280
for amazon to maintain amazon um abroad right if you

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,079
would remove that kind of a business aspect

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,599
uh uh from from that that's not probably would be

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,440
a way for them to do it right uh and in oracle that also is connected

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,040
to another uh approach is what we take with having

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,800
a mysql as open core not purely open source software

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,280
okay yeah so the second question as i understand about the

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,520
uh uh like uh which uh monopolize an open source uh right and really

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,680
dominating all of their communities well i mean

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,000
uh in my opinion right and again my experience kind of open source mostly

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,839
open source databases it was very interesting how to

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,680
uh observe those three very different uh communities right in the relationship

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,079
which you can see in the top open source database

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,079
today like mysql postgresql and and mongodb

00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,160
right with postgresql is uh is a very dynamic very open right you

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,040
can see what in postgresql space there is

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,319
no single community which is more powerful

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,839
than uh uh no single company is more powerful than a postgresql community

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,440
uh as a whole right and i think uh with that it took a long time but there

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,240
is a lot of great things going for postgres those days

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,920
right on other hand that you can see uh mysql which kind of somewhere

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,640
in the middle it's uh grew from uh really this you know

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,079
scandinavian open culture even though it was

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,160
always commercial company but then it was at later time acquired by oracle but

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,800
they still kept a lot of uh i think that's uh that openness and

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,520
they do work with uh community even with

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,760
competitors like like ours as percona uh pretty well

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,720
right and then you would have a mongodb approach right which was really

00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,079
very well modeled on the control control and control right you would see

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,839
them making sure what they would control all the meetups worldwide that would be

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,720
very selective who they invited to one and only mongodb

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,520
conference compared to you know many hundreds of

00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,480
postgresql conference which happen uh every year right and the fact you can

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,400
see is what uh there is really no independent

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,040
mongodb community right to to speak about right there are some user

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,359
groups that they are very much uh uh

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:37,520
focused on you know the uh on uh working with

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,800
their uh mongodb company and their approach to business to market and so on

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,800
and so forth same as you would see with your

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,000
proprietary software companies okay uh thank you well so uh in this case

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,240
like well uh you know that is a you know big

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,359
question right which is not something i thought a lot about right so i uh

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,599
wouldn't comment uh about that outside of this i think

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,400
it's very interesting for me to observe how

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,440
relationship with open source and cloud happen in u.s. versus some other places

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,160
in the world right because they're in uh a lot of

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,880
in in u.s. right you kind of do not think your government preventing

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,000
your access to those like cloud vendors but

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,440
if you go to places like in south america right or

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,920
in russia there is a lot of value put on the open source due to potential

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,359
independent from some uh particular uh you know country

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,960
right which can apply uh apply sanctions to you right for me it

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,760
was kind of very interesting to see that because again this value of open source

00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,080
is not i think as well as us as in some other countries

00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,380
