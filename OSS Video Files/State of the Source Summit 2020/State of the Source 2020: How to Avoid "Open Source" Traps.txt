	How to Avoid "Open Source" Traps
Peter Zaitsev 

With Open Source software preferred by many engineers and executives it is not surprising we see a lot of software which is marketed as having something to do with Open Source software, but not providing all (or any) advantages which true Open Source software provides. In this talk we will look into types of not-quite Open Source software, and provide guidance on how to spot it, how to avoid traps, and pitfalls such software can bring.
