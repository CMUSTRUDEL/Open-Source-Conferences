Title: State of the Source 2020: Sustainability & Resilience through Local Production with Open Source
Publication date: 2020-09-17
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	Sustainability and Resilience through Local Production with Open Source
Mario Behling

The pandemic has brought topics like sustainability and resilience into the limelight. Sustainable business operations are not only important in regards to climate change, today it is important to plan ahead for unforeseen changes. Local production suddenly seems on everyone's lips as it could help to solve shortages that post a threat to local populations. However, in the landscape of proprietary products it is simply not possible to provide the software, hardware schematics and know-how to local populations at the speed required. Traditional proprietary IP controlled distribution models, business development practices and hiring processes do not work in a pandemic. Proprietary models fail societyâ€™s need on every level. A famous example was the shortage of ventilators in many parts of the world. Also advanced supply chains fail in times of closed borders during a pandemic, as well as during political conflicts, turmoils, or weather disasters. Sharing knowledge openly and developing solutions collaboratively in the open source way provides a proven alternative which could be literally live-saving in a pandemic. In this session I will discuss what opportunities open source software and hardware provide to society in these times, what long term benefits global knowledge, design and technology sharing will have and how local production can even help to save the climate.

welcome mario we are excited to hear you present

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,599
sustainability and resilience through local production with open source

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,119
mario belling is the ceo of open tech and i'm going to let him

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,119
provide a brief introduction and get started thanks everybody for joining

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,080
thank you very much kathy i appreciate it and yeah this is really

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,320
cool like that we can use entirely um free and open

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
systems here to connect with each other in those challenging times

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,800
and yeah my topic is also related to these challenging times

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,280
sustainability and resilience through local production with

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,920
open source so this talk is not so much about the technical aspects

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,920
and the process this session is more about the larger ecosystem and why

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
we need sustainable and resilient production and

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,720
then why this is only possible with open source

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,799
in my view i will share more details with you

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,159
in a moment but before i would like to say if you have any quick question

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,600
i am open um for um quick questions also during the talks if they don't

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
take too much time we can also discuss a little bit um

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,560
after the session so please feel free to um like you know share something quickly

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
on monitoring the chat here and if you have anything quickly and of

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,240
course also we have the shared notes as casey pointed out um if you want to

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,720
go more into detail so um yeah let me switch off the cam so

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,040
we can focus on the slides um

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,479
so a little bit about my background first so i'm the founder of open tech

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
and it's a company in germany we do exclusively um

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
free and open source software and hardware in

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,959
2020 now we joined the open next program where we develop open hardware with 19

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,000
partners across europe it's a project that's

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,160
funded by the european union i've been in asia

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,800
for many years um i lived in singapore i lived several years in vietnam i've

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
also been for yeah longer times in taiwan

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,480
in china and also like worked on the one laptop a child project

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
in afghanistan and spent an entire year and they're like working for example in

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,959
the in the university of uh kabul and i love learning languages

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
and whoever sees me they never believe i used to have long hair

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
and played in a rock band we were on tv and

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
yeah famous well medium famous i would say here

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,319
locally and i believe in open tech as a solution for many of our

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
global problems the picture that you see here by the way

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,519
and that is the first car um in in the museum of uh bands diner and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
bands in stuttgart and so i'm always

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,720
excited to to see these um yeah icons of industrial change and

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,120
changes also taking place today so let me start with an opening

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
statement here and sustainable and resilient production

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
and business operations are important especially in times of

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
crisis when it is necessary to plan ahead for

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,159
unforeseen circumstances we need to increasingly

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,799
consider sustainability and resilience as part of many aspects of society

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,200
this means business the global economy health systems food supplies and of

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
course the environment and many more

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,640
so how does open source enable resilient and

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,000
sustainable local production then so here um a few points and that many of

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
us who have an open source software background know

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,720
because many advantages we know from free and

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
open source software also valid for open source production

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,960
open hardware and so on what can you do you can develop and

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,080
provide your own solutions software hardware knowledge and services

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
because you use open licenses you can add new features

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,680
to the hardware to your production system

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,000
you can solve bugs quickly and and adapt your pipelines just like in

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
software you can attract contributors you can work

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
online from around the world on open development

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
platforms and you can support each other here as well

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
of course it's all digital so you can transfer

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,320
digital files to um real production and or to real hardware and that means

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
you can scale up around the world you can deploy these

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,199
solutions and and create prototypes locally and

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,160
decentralized so you don't depend on central uh

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
production platforms and therefore you can be more

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
cost efficient because you can provide this solution to

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
more people for example sending the file digitally

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,320
around the world at no cost or you can and sell this these products together

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
with partners of course like right to repair is a big

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,160
point here and it could be very beneficial um

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
to repair um for example old hardware especially electronics

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
and and of course that's an awesome customer

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
experience and if you see that something works again

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
so a few more details what this means open development and production means

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
collaborating so because you use free and open

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
licenses you don't have to send um like a

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,440
contract to somebody if you want to work together with them

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
because you can just say here and is our code here our schematics here

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,360
um is the information how to produce something

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,520
it is uh freely licensed and you can access it under these conditions

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,800
that you share it again and under the freedoms that um

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,479
are stated in the licenses and of course we need more open standards here we need

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,199
to work with open standards so if you work

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
with uh like free and open hardware if you work in

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
production pipelines and so on you need open standards this is something that we

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
need to work on and you can take advantage of many

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,919
things for example access to issue trackers you don't need

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,080
to keep your development secret you can openly communicate with people

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
invite them um to to look at what you're doing and

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,479
invite them to collaborate with you meaning you can build developer

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,039
communities and these communities can use all the

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,319
open tools that already exist so we're expanding to

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,440
hardware we're expanding to production but we already have

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,639
free and open source software we have these open standards

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
and one of the oldest ones of course email yes

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
a great tool so and what's the next step then

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,240
um you work on the hardware work on the production that you need or

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
documentation so you also share the documentation you can invite

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,680
um contributors that for example are not developers that have different

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
backgrounds this is all open to everyone and

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,199
i've given a talk earlier this year at fosdem then if you're interested in the

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
technical aspects i invite you to look at this talk where

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,400
i talk about how we can take advantage on

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:12,080
like automating open hardware production using continuous integration and this is

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,319
really something cool because um possibly you could like

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,000
automatically produce open hardware just like you

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
um produce open source software prototyping it

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:31,120
and so on please check out my talk um at foster about this and then you can

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
develop a decentralized system we know these

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,080
uh peer-to-peer um sharing platforms and solutions

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
you can do the same thing now with hardware you can do local production

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
send your digital file anywhere and produce it locally

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,959
so working with business models based on open source solution is possible now

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,760
and yeah we are starting to see that more and more

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,959
open collaboration is therefore a key to resilient and sustainable

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,080
and local production but we want to know a little bit more in detail here

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,240
about this why is it more resilient and sustainable

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:21,040
and we want to know what's really here what is this really all about so

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320
let me dive in a bit uh into the state of the world

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,839
and as we currently see it so it just seems there are crisis

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,959
everywhere we have the pandemic crisis at the moment then we have

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,440
political crisis in many parts of the world and we have

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,519
the climate crisis so what is this about so the pandemic

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,120
crisis um and in regards to open source let's

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
talk about this first i have the picture here sorry

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
we are closed and yes businesses are closed everywhere

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,279
in the world borders are shut and we even saw that here in europe where

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,079
suddenly you couldn't go to other countries and

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,399
i'm currently in berlin and this was really horrible because germany is the

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
country with most borders and with

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
like facing most borders or facing many borders with

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,839
other countries in europe and just 80 kilometers

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,800
away from berlin for example we have poland and suddenly the border was

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
closed it's really horrible in a time when when

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
suddenly like beloved ones couldn't get to one another

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
anymore so but that also mean meant distribution

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,720
channels um are closed or where closed

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,240
um it's it's the case in many parts of the world suddenly like you you can't

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
get your goods freely around anymore and also another

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,200
thing that happened was demand for products such as masks

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,160
or even toilet paper suddenly right when the corona crisis started i was in

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:16,079
singapore and it was somehow bizarre to see how there were long queues in a fair price uh supermarkets

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,480
when people like really stocking up on on toilet paper and so on

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,040
yeah that was a rising demand and well people felt they needed but the

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,399
market couldn't keep up with it suddenly there were not enough marks

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
suddenly no toilet paper some basic goods were missing so

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,680
we always heard for many years the market can solve any problem

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
and in times of crisis especially it cannot

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,360
prices surge products become unavailable scams happen

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,880
and you can see online many videos many people talking about how suddenly

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,360
like chinese students bought up like huge supplies of masks

00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
everywhere in the world sent them back to china

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,600
and later on sold them then back again to these countries at a huge

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
profit so these scams happen this is really

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279
a horrible thing that happened here in the market society

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
and another example is our dependence on mobile phone monopolies

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,000
and apple and google for example and they supporting now

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,519
like with features of contact tracing but

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,279
we are really depending on two big companies that are based

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,120
in one part of the world and the entire global population depends on like a

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
feature here well i don't think this is a good

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
solution where people all over the world only depend on

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,399
two companies so yeah and i have more examples

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,480
specialized equipment such as ventilators like we were at the

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,240
fossasia summit in in singapore it really broke my heart

00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,880
and when i heard how companies tried to stop like local

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,839
makers from making spare parts for

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,399
ventilators and that were really needed for example

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
in italy for people who were dying so and this

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
was all only in the name of profit and that

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,079
was really heartbreaking to me maybe some of you who were there

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,120
remember that so self-supporting helping oneself

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,440
is threatened with IP laws it is threatened with copyright with

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
patents and all of these things and the risk for

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,360
like really communities or for personal groups or even like

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,440
small companies locally is it's it's very big

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
and so traditional proprietary ip control distribution models

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
business development practice and hiring processes

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,600
all of these they don't work in a pandemic if you suddenly need somebody

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,040
to develop something for you or to to to to help in a

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,560
hospital and develop a solution you cannot go through this entire process

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,240
of hiring somebody of making a tender and all these things

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,000
and you need a more hands-on approach you meet you need local

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,279
participation so i think many of us see this and i have here in gray

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,399
like my approach is that i think local production can really help to

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,360
solve that and it must be decentralized production

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,600
we can't depend on like a producer in one part of the world it must be able

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,680
it must be possible for companies to produce locally just to solve their

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,680
problem and especially technologies that are

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
or that should be widely available and we can't

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,959
wait to lift these IP restrictions so all of this means it must be open source

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,120
therefore otherwise i don't see in other ways and in this way we can

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
also collaborate around the globe and we can work on

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,959
digital copies of production files that can be easily shared anywhere

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,519
and like even if the internet is down we can still use usb sticks

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,839
and there are so many possibilities so let me go to the next point here

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,839
again then we have the political crisis so this picture on the right hand side

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,800
is actually from honduras in 2009 but there's a marriott hotel on the left

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
and there are on the right-hand side

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,800
ads on the building and so on and if we look at this picture we and we

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,959
wouldn't know it's from honduras then we might think it's from the us or

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,839
from other parts of the world and there are crisis on and going on

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,440
in many parts of the world and this is really a global

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:04,079
yeah thing now right like so this is also impacting us and

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,279
look further look further internationally also there are

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,600
confrontations and term also for example i just want to

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
give the keynotes here many people follow at

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
the trade war and with u.s and australia for example on one

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
side and also other countries versus china where china for

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,880
example threatened australia to ban

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,959
the beef and the u.s then is together on one side and

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,320
and they are threatening tiktok and yeah you know about all these topics and

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
a lot of things are mingled privacy issues and so on

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,320
but the result is it's it's really a confrontation and we don't know

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,839
where this will lead to and then if you look to europe

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
we have britain and the brexit nobody thought it was

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,480
ever possible i myself spent a year in in britain

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
because yeah i'm from east germany and i felt my

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,319
my english wasn't so good so i had the chance my parents supported me to go to

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,039
britain and i was like so amazed how we have this united

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,640
and opening up europe and

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,160
now britain is leaving and they are even saying

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,280
they will not be a trade agreement with the european union so that will mean

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,440
supply chains will be interrupted and there will be many problems then we

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,000
have other topics here like for example the nafta

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,520
agreement and you for the u.s for example raised

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
tariffs against products from canada and mexico

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,679
and i think like canada did that as well and yeah it's like so

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,280
a lot of confrontations are happening and

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,600
we see like kind of like if you're not a global

00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,799
uh kind of top tier company and then you could suffer a lot and

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,559
you could potentially don't have access so what

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,200
i think here again production um doesn't have to

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,240
depend on like one company or on one country we

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,320
can do many things locally and um

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,160
again in order to do this of course it must be open source license that

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
otherwise how can we make all these contracts how when can we

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,520
really freely and efficiently collaborate so also here in this aspect

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,720
it could be and it is in my view a solution

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
and then let me go on

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,600
climate crisis the climate crisis i did some research online and i saw

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,799
there already articles 10 20 years ago about open source

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,200
like being a solution for the climate crisis and the climate

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,880
change this topic is actually very old already and it's sad that

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,799
not much has been done against climate change

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,039
so what we are seeing is increased weather irregularities

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,320
and we see a lot of disasters in australia

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,200
and then one time we saw inundations then like just a short time

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
later there were these huge fires everywhere in australia

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,799
so this is really horrible and then now right now we're seeing

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
wildfires in california we see storms in other parts

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,520
of the u.s so it's really also affecting a lot of

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,280
people then in europe this year we had some a bit more rain for

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,039
example in central europe but because the temperature is often

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,200
much higher and the rain is

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,960
yeah the it's getting humid and and the rain doesn't really go deep into the

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,280
ground and the ground is actually still relatively dry in parts of spain it's

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,919
very dry right now we also see um floods in china

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
we see drops in africa so it seems to be true

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,360
and there are articles and and research papers out there that

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,960
say signs are appearing that climate change

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,240
is progressing faster and more radically than anyone could expect so

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,679
i wouldn't say i have the entire solution to this but

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,120
part of the solution again we could provide the widest possible access to

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,640
new environmentally friendly technologies we

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
could make a green tech development a task for

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,480
the entire society instead of just having dedicated startups or some

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
companies working on it and this means everyone must have access

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,600
to this green tech development and it must be

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,159
open source license so we can ensure a wide adoption everywhere in the world

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,320
where we can solve this problem and let me also

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,679
mention another angle here we could reduce

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
carbon footprint by reducing the shipping of

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,000
products why do we need these huge tankers going around the world

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,159
and when many products can actually be easily produced

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:21,360
locally this is just a waste of of energies and resources so

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,760
concluding this part my opinion is in times of crisis proprietary models

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,200
fail society's need on many levels

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,039
the open approach alone will not be able to solve these problems

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,559
but it provides people from around the world a proven

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,600
and tested collaboration framework and therefore

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,360
a resilient and sustainable model to work on solutions

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,960
because we are not talking about some dream here

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,280
like maybe like 20 years ago people would have said yeah open source doesn't

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
work and this is not possible we have many

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,400
companies we have um like economies um using uh

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,840
open source solutions on a big scale it is mainstream already in many areas

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
and and there are many different models um to to make it for example work

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,440
business wise to make it work on different levels so this is not

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
a dream this is a proven model that we can now take and adopt um

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,720
elsewhere

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
so open source collaboration creates sustainable

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,159
and resilient solutions we need to make it mainstream in order to

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,039
resolve those crises and resolve the problems in

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,400
the world and we need to create a more resilient

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
and sustainable global society that takes advantage of the open source

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,240
collaboration model and so this is very important for me

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,919
and i think it's not only about um like open source license and now i

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
release something on open source the real benefit of open

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,320
source is that that we can all collaborate and uh

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,520
we really must add this into our code of conducts

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,600
that we should cooperate with companies that

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,880
develop things in a collaborative way just like

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
taking the advantages of the licenses and of the distribution model

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,559
is not enough open source is about collaboration

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,400
and we need to enforce and encourage that

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,840
collaboration so how do we do this now practically how do we create a resilient

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,080
and sustainable open source um model or even an open source

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,440
society what do we need to make this happen

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
so i don't have all the answers but i'm sure like there are a lot of people

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,200
who think about this in the community and here are a few ideas that i have

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,200
so um in order to really inspire others we need more open source success stories

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
of companies and organizations and i clearly mean

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
here uh companies and organizations that collaborate that have the code open that

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,000
have the entire collaboration process open we need funding for open source

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
startups and a different vc mentality

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,240
bc mentality um often is like in the way or that was how i learned it

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,200
and experienced it at different events and and gathering that the vcs

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
comes i and was looking for the next a billion

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320
dollar startup um that basically dominates the market

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,400
but actually there can be many uh startups and companies and

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,080
organizations that continuously generate an income and

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,080
that are like good as like

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,200
developers and and also work in a business sense they don't

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,600
always have to be the billion dollar startup or the

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,279
monopoly duopoly or whatever poly so they shouldn't be so

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:04,159
just like a few dominating um companies so and then another thing that

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
we can do is legislation like the

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,000
right to repair needs to be enforced we need

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,360
to make links here with the climate and fridays for future community it is

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,159
not acceptable that we cannot like repair or update

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,039
products for example from apple or that we cannot like have access

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,640
to and all the features and possibly even like uh

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,720
environmentally friendly features to cars like from from tesla for example

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,679
and i think like we should really make this point

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,520
and try to contact the people elon musk or whatever

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,240
at tesla and this is very important and i think they they have many

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
different ways to generate an income and they don't need to harm

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,440
the environment by by doing that that that can't be

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,760
that's just not acceptable and in in order to

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,880
enforce all these things and part of all these things is of course

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,080
in open standards i don't want to go too much

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,679
into detail here with the open standards and because

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,360
it could be like an entire session just dedicate or even track dedicated to

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,679
open standards and so we need to come up with ways to

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,520
encourage and enforce the open source collaboration model instead of models

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,159
that simply take advantage and then i have to call out here unfortunately

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,480
google and yeah i mean they supported us

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,919
here with foss asia and open tech in the in the past but like

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,080
um still right i mean like we have to address

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,279
um points like for example the distribution model

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,679
in of of android which is not developed in the open as an open source project it

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
is just licensed and it doesn't really

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,520
connect with others so so we need to brand this as a misconduct

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,240
in our in our co season our code of conduct

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,080
the code of conducts are a little bit too much on how i

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
for me personally on how i speak and so on i'm not an

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,559
english native speaker um even though it might sound right for some of you but i

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,640
i have my challenges it can't be the focus of code

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,360
of conducts that we address personal ways how people

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,279
address each other in all this way this is all important and definitely

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,000
unwilling to learn but um these close collaboration models

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,360
they really harm the planet and if you look at all these points that i

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,399
made previously we need the sharing in order to solve

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,039
the problems of the world

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,200
so i can always call out others but i also want to share

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
like what we are trying and i think we also need

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,279
um the feedback of the community and input of others how we can do better but

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,640
i i let me share a bit what we are doing at um

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,360
the foss asia community in singapore um or at the company that i started in

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,440
berlin and to support the drive to collaborative open source production

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,279
and i want to add here um also a collaborative

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,000
collaborative society

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,440
so we have many projects that we develop

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,399
and not all the projects always under active development sometimes people come

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,799
sometimes we go sometimes people get a job

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,880
we have a lot of people signing up but what you can see here we are always also

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,559
interested in in hardware and for example here

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
fossasia knitting it was a very big thing and a few years

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,960
ago and really helped and collaborated with a few

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,039
projects to bring them to the next level for example upgrading old knitting

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,480
machines so um there are alternatives everywhere

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
where we can improve things and the textile industry

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,679
is a big topic that we need to address so a little bit of background

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,720
i don't know if everyone knows about fossasia

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,399
we started this 2009 and basically we wanted to have an

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,159
event and we were inspired and by the work of osi

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,880
by foster and people around the world and and i was based at that time in asia

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,960
and with a few people he said let's do an

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,640
event and at an event people meet and they have ideas they have projects

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,159
and so we said like yeah let's host some ideas on

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,080
a git repository and then later we moved

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,320
our git repositories to github when it became a big thing

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,440
and over the time we had over 4 000 people

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,000
registering with like with the organization but i

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,840
you know i mean like big numbers are always impressive but what is really

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,360
important is what are the contributors who really

00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
continue and engage with the project over a

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,679
longer period or who make like important um changes over

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,919
a shorter period of time so we have around 150 developers

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,880
um active monthly and as i said they change

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,720
and i would say and i estimate around 30 plus core

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,919
developers in different projects and we have 10 people

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,159
working for us in different capacities full time

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,960
um throughout the year we're training around 2000 developers in coding

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,039
programs so coding programs for example koti program

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,840
is one that's starting soon and um we have a lot of meetups we are

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,080
now like of course have to trans refer more to online meetings and a lot

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,080
of um articles also on our blog so

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,919
what projects so a little bit going into detail with

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
the project um that i have here for example suzy ai

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
and and like many people in the tech community we are inspired

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,200
by star trek and we like star trek and so for example here you see a picture of

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,279
scotty talking into a mouse when he came back from the future

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,000
um to the past um then he tried to talk to the computer he said

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,039
what this computer doesn't talk that is strange

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,480
but today it is a normal thing we see a lot of

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,840
voice assistants um available but all these voice assistants are connected to

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,559
a central cloud and this is not how we can um make

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,840
like the assistant um like sustainable and resilient because

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,519
this assistant depends for example on a cloud in the u.s or depends on the cloud

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,720
in china what if china says yeah the communist

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,799
party like no no we we will now block this or

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,200
yeah or if the u.s say oh yeah that's part of a trade agreement

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,240
you can't access your cloud resources anymore

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,360
until you agree or something so this is really challenging

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,159
and uh potentially so we need an a voice assistant that is

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,720
independent and there are a lot of cool

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
projects and we have here our own approach with the susie ai smart

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,760
speaker that runs entirely on a raspy and integrating with deep speech but you

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,080
can also potentially use cloud services but you

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,880
don't have to and of course many people are concerned here

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,240
about privacy so that's an added benefit and if you

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,399
just have things running locally and then you don't have to worry about

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,799
sharing your data with like

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
companies that you don't agree with or like you don't have to worry about

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,320
hacks and because um it could be potentially even offline

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
so that suzy ai that's what we're doing and

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,120
we want to set an example here work on a software

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,320
mixed hardware project and openly and collaborating at it our resources

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
are limited but you can also already see a lot of

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,120
progress and you can for example join of our one of our upcoming

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,000
workshops um with a norbert um uh how to install it

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,679
even on the desktop so a lot of progress has been made recently in our ideas here

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,399
to make a wiki like content management system

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,559
so quite a few interesting ideas and how we can also like

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,720
make the creation of skills of these mini programs to speak

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,080
uh how we can make it um easy so this is what we are doing with susie ai and then

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,360
like i want to talk more about like a project that's um

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,640
like more in the direction of hardware our pocket science lab pslab i o

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,279
this is entirely free and open of course we don't control the chip yet

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,000
and risk five is not um ready for for our use cases

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
but everything else is open the entire schematics

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,399
this project is already developed since 2015

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,080
and we're producing it and work on this now here even

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,120
in a you funded program soon there will be a

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,760
second version coming out that's really cool you can connect it to desktop you

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,440
can have a python app um where you can like make

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,879
your own configurations or if you just want to get started use

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,560
our entirely free and open um pslab android app

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,159
and you can do a lot of cool things with this if you're a scientist

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000
so open science here comes into this interestingly nowadays

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,839
science is not always open a lot of

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,119
like like like for example if you look at

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,800
the data also it's not even always available

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,320
and if you think about medicine if you think about pharmacy if you think about

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,639
a lot of different topics whereas like the definition of science

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,720
should be that it is open and that's what we are doing here up to

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,960
the last layer of hardware and for example you can use this device

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,320
as an oscilloscope as a multimeter logic analyzer

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,359
and many more and you can plug in any sensor that is

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,599
compatible with i squared c so a lot of possibilities here it's

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,119
sometimes difficult for people to to when when i talk to them what is this

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
device because they say what can this device do

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,440
this device is just like so versatile it can do

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,920
so many things and of course there's also a lot of work for us

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,200
because if it can do many things if it has so many uh

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,560
features and it has so many possibilities to extend it there's also

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,880
a lot of work a lot of bugs that can happen potentially and um

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,960
yeah even up to the firmware level there will be an interesting talk on

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,160
actually a panel discussion on firmware by the way tomorrow here at the event

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,440
and we're producing it in china and cooperation uh

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,560
uh here with the founder institute in in germany

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,960
but it is as i said we can produce locally so the next version

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,800
that we will sell in europe we will also produce that in europe

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
and whereas like uh versions that are sold in asia for example can be

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,359
produced in asia and of course we have to see how this whole trade war thing

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,079
is developing but uh yeah we want to set an example here

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,079
with producing locally and that's what we do here was the first version and

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,200
soon will the second version follow which we produce in different parts of

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,480
the world and then of course it's about reaching

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,800
out as i said let's inspire others so we do make our workshops here for

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,960
example in in the um science center in singapore in the

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,599
hackerspace in singapore which you see here on the

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:47,280
bottom right and and then we do yeah here participate in events

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,359
like the science hack workshops um or science hack days in india here

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,000
this one was for example in belgium and

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,599
yeah then we do other things like for example like uh

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,280
trying to inspire new and young people who come as

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,119
developers here into the community for example on the left-hand side

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,520
is just amazing how many people join events in india

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,000
and that was an outreach event for our code heat coding

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,359
program which is as i said starting soon and then we do workshops for example

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,800
with the development aid corporation that like

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,400
fund part of these activities here as an example for in vietnam in the

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,359
mekong delta and yeah we do hacker phones with the

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,000
unesco and so right now we're talking with them

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
what we can do online and here's some pictures of a hackathon

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,320
in saigon in vietnam that was 2018

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,320
and uh then we do jugaad fest i don't know if you know jugaad

00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,920
uh you guys like this idea of hacking the indian way

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,079
making things work some indians regarded as something negative but i think it's

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,119
just so beautiful to to make something work

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,040
out of yeah very little resources so so this is actually

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,000
just so inspirational and we said let's take this as a as a name

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,640
even foreign for annual events here and we went to hyderabad

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,079
and in the bvrt uh college we were able to run this event and we're

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,839
cooperating with bvrt they're great supporters

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,680
and then we have the annual fossasia signature event which is the first

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,560
asia summit it's taking place since yeah 2010

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,320
2009 we had a smaller pre-event and that is happening every year in

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,200
march so we're sharing all of this and as i

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
said here i'm right now in berlin so of

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,040
course in berlin they're also events for example you see mitch ortman here

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
and you see a lot of people who you might have met

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,480
at other events and i think this is all already very overwhelming

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,359
don't you think i mean you see all these events you see all these people and say

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,440
wow this is too much but that's what i want to do here i want to

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,240
overwhelm you guys and to to engage and and do and

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,640
continue this and and be inspired and just say yeah so

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,480
many things are going on i also need to do something but we are not

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,720
perfect of course and we're always happy to to learn

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,560
more and one critic from the past was

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,520
that we don't use free and open source tool to organize our events

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,200
so we we checked out and tried to find a tool but at the time when we started

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,599
that project eventyay our open event software

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,359
then we didn't find any project nowadays there are

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,200
different projects pre-targets or the susie community as well and so on but

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,359
at that time we couldn't find one so we started our own

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,599
and because there was no good ticketing and speaker handling system that was

00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,599
open and yeah we ran events up to 3500 people

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:19,200
and it's really great to see that here at the osi it's also using eventyay and we discovered a number of bugs we

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,520
also discovered in an issue with the integration of paypal

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,839
which was actually also like a challenge with the documentation at

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,680
paypal but that was really an opportunity here to improve the system

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,040
and thank you very much for patience i'm coming to the end but

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,760
i still want to mention a few technology stacks here so if you are developing an

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,560
interesting to join for example the open event project

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,240
here this is the current state of the project how far are we our different

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,200
components that we need so let me not close this talk

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,880
without mentioning that we actually um are very happy to

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,079
to to see you joining um the development of course so

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,079
so software hardware production it all needs to be open source and we try to

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,640
make this happen so let's talk about how we can build a sustainable and resilient

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,200
open source production ecosystem everywhere let's do this this the end of

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,800
my talk so thank you very much for chiming

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,000
in here and yeah i'm happy to answer any questions

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,079
yeah so i see already here justin mentioned in the chat

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,359
funding for open source starters and new models to vc funding i have to give a

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,160
plug for some of what i do with the unicef

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,839
innovation fund where we fund creation or collaboration open source

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,040
products only so this is the right direction

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,000
um it must be open source only and i'll definitely check that out justin

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,400
thank you very much for for sharing it and i also like i

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,800
switch quickly over to the shared notes my english is very much better than you

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,440
my german well thank you very much but like i

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,680
think there's still a lot to improve um so please list the questions uh

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,000
yeah please list any questions or um you can also like

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,240
just like use the microphone here is the question for um a successful

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,800
open source pharmacy community so do you know a

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,119
successful community here i don't know a successful

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,440
pharmacy community and i see a big challenge in that

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,280
because if you want to sell medicine or like pharmaceutical drugs

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
then you often need to go through an

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,560
extensive licensing process with authorities so

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,079
for example we have one project where we have this

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,680
kind of headband for for neural waves

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,520
yeah and if you want to use such a thing like

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,680
in the medical field then it would have a long process however i know there

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,160
are and there's this thing bio pumps so that is related there

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,960
was also this book the bio pumps a few years ago and

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,000
uh and you should there's probably the the biggest challenge chris lamb chris

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,440
thanks for all for this there's openhealthcare.org.uk

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,960
chris um any anything you can share about this community

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,920
um anything you would you know opening medication technologies and production

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,440
centered this kind of thing and yeah i mean like

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,319
that would be that you definitely need that right and

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,400
i um i what what i see is um there was this

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,920
covid covid-19 um list of uh

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,200
devices that people all around the world do

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,800
so um i think we can um definitely share more about this um in

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,960
the channels here of the event new health

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,839
yeah actually like yes now that i come to think of it

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,680
a few weeks ago um one guy from new health

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,000
new health and gnu health was in in the weekly um open hardware meeting

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,839
that we organized every saturday

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,640
so a lot of issues around privacy regulation

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,319
again yeah hey mario i had a question as well

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,200
sure please go ahead so you you made a pretty nuanced point about codes of

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,520
conduct and i i think i missed it could you

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,880
maybe repeat what was your recommendation for

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,440
code of conduct as it related to your talk

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,400
yeah so so um for example like i as a non-native speaker i

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,920
sometimes have this uh challenge that i for example get

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,839
confused and i really have to improve there

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,440
with uh the different uh pronouns yeah because like

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,720
they and and like in english you only have "you"

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,640
in singular and then "you" in plural also and so on so where's like

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,960
for example in german or another language it's like a completely

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,520
different word so so and language is developing so fast

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
so and this is often like very focused on

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,040
in the code of conduct and i think like

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,720
what in my view especially in international communities

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,760
um we often should be forgiving a little bit more

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,000
and that people don't always have this like deep background in this

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,560
what is important for me and code of conduct is actually what people do

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,440
because like sometimes we have people talking sometimes we have people using

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,920
the right word or the wrong word or what not but actually if things come

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,000
from the heart and if we actually do good if people do good around the

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,560
world and then this should be also

00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,280
like somehow this kind of topic should be more

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,560
addressed in code of conduct because if for example like

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,319
if we have like events or something and and and people say

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,400
this my thing is open source but it is not open source they're not following

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,119
all the open source um collaboration

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,040
guidelines or something like that yeah or for example like in our open next

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,240
program some people said we have um here in open source projects

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:34,240
it is under the um non-commercial creative commons license that's not open

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,319
source so um in my view um if we could start

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,079
to talk when we talk about open

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,200
code of conduct if we talk more about the

00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,560
the real actions the real actions that people do

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,000
yeah what is really open source what is this is very important for me if

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,359
people don't share for example they shouldn't be allowed to

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,839
call their project open source or if people only use open source

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,599
license it is maybe okay then to call it open

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,000
source but is it acceptable to talk about you know

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,960
like where do we draw the line i maybe we can discuss about this more i

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,720
also don't have a perfect answer but i see that we

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,680
actually need to enable people around the world

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,520
to collaborate with each other and all in order to solve the problems so if

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,240
we have more and more big companies and they close the community off

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,920
from collaborating by only releasing software

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,680
every now and then and not accepting external

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,760
code contributions this is not the acceptable

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,119
open source collaboration model yeah i don't know

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,559
does do you understand does it yeah i follow

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,640
i thought you were saying i really like the initial note of being more aware

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,720
of multicultural backgrounds and language and pronouns is quite

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,960
challenging so that that's a big note the other parts

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,520
i'd love to talk to you for an hour about that but there's a ton of good

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,040
questions in the shared notes thank you okay thank you so um

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,800
um questions

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,040
can open source software be used as commercial purposes

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,079
i can open source software be use as commercial purpose

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,079
is it possible yes of course yeah that is uh

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,520
clearly stated in in the open source licenses you can

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,880
sell open source software and you can like you know you can you can

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,599
sell the gpl you can take the software and

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,280
sell the software with the general public license

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,240
and in some countries if you uh buy a product with a license it could

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,640
even be an advantage tax-wise i learned recently from a tax

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,559
accountant so definitely you can sell open source

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,680
software yes

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,800
okay okay thank you so and i still have more questions i agree completely

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,400
with your assessment of the importance of open standards but how can we in the

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,520
foss community with the unwillingness of several big

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,599
companies to follow open standards this is a very important question and um

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,200
definitely i think like the work of the osi in this area

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,920
is important and we need to like encourage the osi to take a more

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,119
active stance on this i know that simon phipps

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,520
um is working on standards levels and

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,960
and compliance and i don't have the perfect answer

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,319
the first thing is to actively talk about this

00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,559
and yeah encourage and ultimately enforce standards so um i think we also

00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,319
need to um be more active again on the

00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,839
um policy level here

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,480
i hope that answers the question do you know a successful open source pharmacy

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,319
other that one we had have you heard of any commercial organization that have an

00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,680
ips licensing business model which

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,440
transition partly or fully to an open source based

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,559
model and well if i understand the question correctly

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,680
do we have like an kind of proprietary closed source

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,240
project or company or community and and that moved to an open source model

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,200
yes there are many and of course the one of

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,200
the most famous one is the blender so yeah we had many events we

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,480
had the chance to welcome blender um fox and

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,839
this definitely uh yeah it's a great example

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,400
but i wish of course we had more examples because blender

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,319
like how it was open sources was that actually there was a lot of money

00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,480
collected and the the original investors they were paid off

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,000
so um so tone rosenthal could then uh make his project open source because

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,079
he needed um his VCs to allow this

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,640
and yeah i i don't know but of course yeah we are trying

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,480
i hope we we can see more i also was thinking like why

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,920
don't we see like for example some countries or something like

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,920
um buy for example like big manufacturers

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,280
um of ventilators or something and release

00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,520
this schematics release the the work as open source wouldn't it benefit

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,880
the entire world and wouldn't that be a quite a

00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,280
small um expense yeah so i'm definitely with you

00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,559
but if anyone else has more points you please fill it into number

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,599
three and i'm moving to number four does your

00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,720
community organize hackathons and yes we organize hackathons um

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:08,079
for example in cooperation with the um unesco so please um yeah follow us

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,520
on one of our channels um subscribe to to to the email like you

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,800
find the links on fossasia.org and or on twitter also

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,119
number five do you see open source being applied on non-software fields

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,640
for example manufacturing yes so that's what we

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:36,160
do in the open next program um opennext.eu

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,720
so i'm sharing the link in the um

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:49,440
the shared notes so um and that is a newfound project and um a lot of

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,240
companies from manufacturing um furniture to bicycles

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,280
to electronics like us here are participating in this

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,599
and we want to have like examples how this

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,400
can be successful and also like of course inspire others

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:15,839
