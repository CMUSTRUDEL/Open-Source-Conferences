Description: 
	Sustainability and Resilience through Local Production with Open Source
Mario Behling

The pandemic has brought topics like sustainability and resilience into the limelight. Sustainable business operations are not only important in regards to climate change, today it is important to plan ahead for unforeseen changes. Local production suddenly seems on everyone's lips as it could help to solve shortages that post a threat to local populations. However, in the landscape of proprietary products it is simply not possible to provide the software, hardware schematics and know-how to local populations at the speed required. Traditional proprietary IP controlled distribution models, business development practices and hiring processes do not work in a pandemic. Proprietary models fail societyâ€™s need on every level. A famous example was the shortage of ventilators in many parts of the world. Also advanced supply chains fail in times of closed borders during a pandemic, as well as during political conflicts, turmoils, or weather disasters. Sharing knowledge openly and developing solutions collaboratively in the open source way provides a proven alternative which could be literally live-saving in a pandemic. In this session I will discuss what opportunities open source software and hardware provide to society in these times, what long term benefits global knowledge, design and technology sharing will have and how local production can even help to save the climate.
