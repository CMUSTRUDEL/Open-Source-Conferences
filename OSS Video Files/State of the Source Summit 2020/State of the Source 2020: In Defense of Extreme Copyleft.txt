Description: 
	In Defense of Extreme Copyleft
Henrik Ingo

The GPL and the concept of Copyleft is one of the major innovations in software freedom, and the IT industry. Over the years degrees of copyleft have emerged: More expansive, as in AGPL, and less expansive, as in LGPL or even MPL. In this talk I will discuss recent controversial proposals that proposed to expand the boundaries of copyleft further: Facebook's React patent clause, Server Side Public License, Cryptographic Autonomy License. (Only the last one was certified by OSI.)
