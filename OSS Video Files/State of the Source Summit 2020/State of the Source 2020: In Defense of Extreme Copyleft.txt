Title: State of the Source 2020: In Defense of Extreme Copyleft
Publication date: 2020-09-23
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	In Defense of Extreme Copyleft
Henrik Ingo

The GPL and the concept of Copyleft is one of the major innovations in software freedom, and the IT industry. Over the years degrees of copyleft have emerged: More expansive, as in AGPL, and less expansive, as in LGPL or even MPL. In this talk I will discuss recent controversial proposals that proposed to expand the boundaries of copyleft further: Facebook's React patent clause, Server Side Public License, Cryptographic Autonomy License. (Only the last one was certified by OSI.)

hello welcome everyone uh to my sunny garden

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,320
here in finland my name is henrik ingo and

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
i've invited you today to talk about the topic i will always be passionate about

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,560
copyleft licensing so for those that don't know me

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,920
my day job is in the database industry with open source databases

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
i work for data stacks where we develop and sell

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,079
cassandra based products and before that i worked many years with homodb

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:52,079
and then with mysql and mariadb and in terms of licensing

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,879
cassandra is an apache licensed database on the db for the most

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,320
time i used agpl when i was there and my sql of course is gpl licensed

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,360
so i have some experience working with these

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
today uh i want to talk about copyleft licensing and

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,400
and in particular uh you know about opportunities uh where we might uh

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
for argument's sake i want to go beyond what

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,759
gpl and agpl provide and and i'm going to talk from three recent

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,040
real examples the cryptographic autonomy license

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,000
which has been recently approved by the osi

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,240
mongodb is a server-side public license which was submitted to osi but

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
never approved and then the facebook's uh

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,439
bsd plus patents clause which never seriously attempted to

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:09,840
become an open source license at all so uh all right let's start

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
i think probably everyone watching this talk

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
knows about the history of richard stallman and gpl

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,920
but i i feel the talk would still be amiss if uh i didn't quickly go through

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
the the thought process that led to to the

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,959
gpl license uh so yeah as we all know in the 60s 70s

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
when computer science and programming was

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,319
invented basically uh software so and source code

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,080
was freely available and developed maybe mostly academic circles first

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
and it was natural to kind of share what you have done

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,319
and then also use others work just like you do in science

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,040
today as well and but then 70s 80s we saw the rise of the

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
first commercial software companies such as

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,159
the first unix vendors and they realized that they could keep

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,200
the source code to themselves only publish binary programs uh that

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,879
they sell to their customers and and this way

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,519
nobody else could use the source code that they had produced

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,040
and this uh yeah this led to development and as also

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,560
universities of course started using commercial

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
operating systems for example uh so

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,760
there were people who were annoyed by this development because now they no

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,319
longer had access to the source code of the system they were

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,959
using they had become consumers of a computer rather than developers who

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,519
could jointly develop the software so stallman was one of these people

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,879
maybe he was more annoyed than most i don't know i wasn't there at that

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,720
time yet the first reaction that i've read about

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,600
by many has been that copyright is bad we should fight copyright legislation uh

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
or it should not apply to software kind of like

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,160
the pirate movement still argues today that they basically

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,320
declare they're gonna ignore copyright and copy stuff

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,680
anyway but of course in the case of software

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
it doesn't really help if you don't have access to the source code in the first

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
place so after a while

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,680
after a while stallman did

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,919
realize that actually copyright legislation

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,520
isn't bad it's neutral uh and it's powerful in a way that

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,080
if you are the author of software you actually ask the author have have

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,840
the power to license your software any way you want

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
and and closed source software is just one

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,960
option that the commercial vendors have started using so

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,440
yeah basically it's like programmers are super heroes who can choose to use their

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,000
powers for or even when they choose licensing i mean

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,919
and this left to the this led to the idea

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,759
of the gpl license where you publish software under the license saying that

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,479
i am sharing my source code with you and also you are compelled

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,280
to share source code uh with me and and with other users

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
and developers in the community another name for

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,080
copyleft license is also basic protocol licenses i like copyleft which which

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,479
is the original term it's kind of the opposite of copyright

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
although copyleft licenses actually depend on copyright

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
so this was a significant innovation by stallman

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
i i rate it uh you know at the same level as

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,360
internet cloud computing uh gpl license has been an innovation that

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,840
changed the trajectory of the entire software industry fundamentally

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,319
and yeah we all i i'm using a linux laptop

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,199
to record this actually i wonder if also the software i'm using

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
is gpl licensed

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,800
and that there is so much and even like internet and cloud computing

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
itself depend on these technologies that we developed as open source and many of

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
them the 80s and 90s were under the gpl

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,680
which at the time was the most popular open source license

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,599
so for the purpose of this talk it feels like

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,599
you know if it was such a good idea and has been so successful

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,520
it makes sense to discuss that can can we apply this same principle

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
more broadly to new areas which maybe are not covered today

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
and in fact we already know that because there are

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
there is like a spectrum of copyleft licenses available anyway

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
so gpl is the most popular one which was based on this idea that you have to

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,800
share source code together with the software but

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,440
then lgpl the lesser gpl was uh

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
was not our scope of the license is narrower so

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,639
you have to keep the source code of the lgpl

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,520
related software open but it doesn't expand into a larger program

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
and then on the other hand the agpl affirmative gpl

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,840
of course was created before for network programs

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,400
where where you don't necessarily copy or install software to use it you just

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,479
use it over the network and the free software foundation i

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,639
wanted to also provide an alternative where users of

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,599
software's as a service would be entitled to source code

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,039
which is the copyleft principle so so it makes sense to ask is there

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,159
something beyond the spectrum where where there could be

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,560
even more areas that that we could have licenses for and that's why i want

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
to quickly go through these three licenses

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
that i mentioned and let's start with the cryptographic

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,640
autonomy license which is available and approved as an open source license today

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
so we have already made this expansion in

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
one direction

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,519
the cryptographic autonomy license uh was submitted uh

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,920
by and authored by van lindberg commissioned by a company called

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,600
holochain which is a startup in the blockchain industry

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
and and maybe the license actually has some features

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,720
uh specifically interesting like this peer to peer network i'm actually not

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
gonna focus on that today but i i can't help noticing that it

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,440
seems that this license perpetuates this this common

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
overloading where anything that uses a blockchain

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
is called crypto such as cryptocurrencies and so on

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
because there is nothing particularly cryptographic about this license i think

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,360
it's a good network copyleft license or software as

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,959
a service license which also could be used for blockchain

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,959
so the name has raised some questions i think when people

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:18,480
encounter this license it also addresses several issues with the hpl

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
where which have been seen like awkward or

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
maybe even limited the gpl i i will return to some of those

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,839
later but the main focus now for the

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,440
cryptographic autonomous license we introduced uh introduced copyleft also

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,440
for user data and i'm gonna see if my grill

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
is warm so we can talk about use of data in

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,440
network software services in addition to providing each recipient

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
the opportunity to have access to the source code you cannot use

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
the permissions given under this license to interfere with

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,720
recipients ability to fully use an independent copy

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,760
of the work generated from the source code

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
you provide with the recipient's own user data

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
so and user data means any data that is an input to

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,600
or an output from the work so first of all it's worth noting this is actually

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,480
very similar to the gdpr requirements that you have

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,399
in europe which was one point i brought out

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
when when we were reviewing this license on the osi list

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,240
that in some ways it's not a huge burden in some jurisdictions where you have to

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,920
provide this anyway so the point of this license is kind of

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,600
that what what if somebody uh is offering a software as

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
a service social network or some productivity

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,519
software then yeah sure you can

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
you can offer users the source code but because you have all their data

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
you're never going to migrate to another service anyway because without it

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,360
it's kind of like here in my grill what if the license guarantees that yeah

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
you can take the rest of the coal and do make your own barbecue if you

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,639
want but the meat has to stay locked in this grill so

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:39,839
there is nothing for me to barbecue under those conditions

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,200
i think this is ready let's let's take the meat out of the grill

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
anyway

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:12,560
let me go so questions when reviewing the license

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,880
is it possible legally absolutely you a software license can have all kinds of

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,560
conditions you can only use this if you're a student

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,720
you cannot use this in some countries which are embargoed you can only use

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
this on a particular weekday

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,480
but of course in open source licenses question is uh does it comply with the

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,160
so-called open source definition uh and one principle then is that open

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
source licenses shouldn't have additional conditions that have nothing

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,079
to do with the software so for example there cannot be a license

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,160
saying you can use this software freely but you

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
have to go and take a swim each morning because it's healthy for

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
you because that's not the condition that

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,199
has any relevance to the license so there was a lot of discussion is user

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,600
data relevant to the providing user data relevant to the

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,199
software or not osi decided yes but the revised version

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,440
of the cal is actually very narrowly scoped

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,920
so it's very clear that the reason you have to provide user data

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,440
is solely to provide the software freedom to the user to use it with this

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,760
specific software which is licensed so

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,320
personally i was glad it was approved because now we have expanded

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:59,839
of copyleft also provide user data

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
so

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,079
what about software services now

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,240
if we think about the social network your friends are there you can get your

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
data you can get the source code what are you going to do with them

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,959
you're going to have your own social network with no friends

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,040
this is a concept called network effects where

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,120
if some some service has a lot of users it kind of gravitate by gravitation

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,480
pulls in more users for example in the antitrust

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
investigations with microsoft the microsoft office if everybody else uses

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
microsoft office you need to be able to open those files

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
so you have to use microsoft office as well

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,480
so we still need a copyleft license for friends

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,839
i don't know how it's gonna work

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
so welcome to my kids tree hut where we will talk about

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,639
mongodb server-side public license i must first make a disclosure as many

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
of you know i did work for mongodb at the time

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
but i wasn't involved in this process in any way

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,120
i live seven time zones away from the mongodb headquarters

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,959
so i i generally wasn't involved in in any topics on this kind of strategic

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,480
level nevertheless i i want to be a bit

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,639
careful and and mindful because i was an employee at the time so

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,120
so the next few minutes will basically just be publicly available facts i'm not

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,720
going to express a personal opinion for or against except

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
when once we get back to talking about agpl

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:58,160
in general so sspl was submitted to osi in october 2018

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,680
and the context here is important this happened at the time where

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,439
a lot of other database vendors also switched

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,959
their open source license to some other licenses some of which they

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,240
wrote themselves uh or or just became more closed source

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,319
a lot of different approaches were seen and mongodb

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,839
mongodb at this point

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,600
was the only one who at least attempted to create a new open source license and

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,760
submit it for approval for the osi

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:48,960
so that's why i think it's still relevant for this kind of talk

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
in general at the time i think it's good to

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,559
note for that a lot of these other companies were very

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,760
critical about amazon in particular they felt that their

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,720
revenues were threatened by amazon who could take their software for free

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,520
and they would do all the development but amazon would get most of the money

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,520
when mongodb submitted this license they they never actually mentioned

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,400
amazon or some other vendor by name and the submission was more of a

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,799
technical nature talking about microservice architectures

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,880
or distributed databases and so on on the other hand it seems like

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,840
most of the reviewers did criticize them for

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,280
not yeah not not treating public cloud vendors equally and

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
it was interpreted that the license was created

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
to essentially act as a poison pill against

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
cloud vendors so i think the americans say

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,880
saying here is that if it if it walks like a duck and it looks like a duck

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,600
then it's a duck

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,679
so the outcome was that the license was never approved so

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,280
what the ssl sspl uh did uh it's actually based on the http

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,400
license and it simply rewrote paragraph 13

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,679
which is also the unique paragraph in a gpl

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:33,440
which has to do with uh with the the network aspect of the copyleft

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,480
and and sspl and mongodb argue that

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,160
agpl doesn't work for something like a distributed

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
database and it doesn't work for a cloud service that's based on

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
multiple microservices because gpl and agpl

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
basically are written as if all software is a

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,080
single process running on a single server

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,440
but okay their attempt to redefine the scope of what is a service

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,760
uh got a lot of criticism and and eventually the discussion ended

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,360
so that's about all i can say about mongodb and

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,919
the sspl license but let's talk about hgpl and and this

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,360
paragraph 13. so uh the the key point here is

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,559
the part where i say if if you modify the program

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,640
your modified version must prominently offer all users

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,039
interacting with it remotely through a computer network so so this means

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,799
probably i'm using software as a service or some kind of social network or game

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,159
anything that you could use a blog software that you can use with

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,159
the browser over a network so the first criticism against agpl is

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,360
it seems to assume that there is some kind of user interface to

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
interact with it so but if i develop a database

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,000
not even a distributed one and the database is used as part of some

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,039
other software users are not actually interacting with

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,360
it but it is part of the larger service that user interact

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,919
does the agpl then not apply to this kind of database or

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:31,280
or lower level library software in my opinion it's not wrong of authors

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,080
of such software to expect that they should have

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
a kind of network copyleft benefits as well

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
so the the cryptographic autonomy license actually did address this

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
and it's written in a way that it doesn't depend on

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,880
on the software having a user interface for example or

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,440
or it doesn't depend on a specific way for the network interaction

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,520
it just says that you have to provide the source code to your users

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,400
and it's you know it doesn't matter what uh what technical what the technical

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
circumstances are uh you just have to make sure that you

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,559
do it um so that's another reason i did like

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,159
uh the cal maybe i think it's actually more

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,240
important than the user data provision event

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,320
to address this the other point which i don't think the cal addresses and

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,880
maybe we are not ready to to define what is the scope of a web

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,720
service this is what mongodb

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,080
tried to try to do with the sspl

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
this is a good case where it's difficult to write

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,520
a solid legal text defining what is part of a web service consisting of multiple

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,039
microservices calling each other over rest or

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,159
something else and what is not like i don't know your

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,799
your disc uh block service that

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,320
you use as a disk or the compute service that

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,039
starts your operating system in instances

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,240
um so it has to stop somewhere and the gpl

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,440
and agpl in fact have this kind of system library

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,520
exception so it's it's kind of well understood there that

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
what is the scope of gpl and a gpl for a distributed system it's kind of

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,039
harder because everything is distributed but intuitively we can say that okay

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,360
these microservices do actually belong together and these

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
other are generic system services

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,760
i think it would be great if we could have

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
have a license which could capture this concept of a

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,279
program which isn't a single process running on a single server

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,440
hopefully we will see such license in the future

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:03,440
so the last license to discuss was facebook's patent clause that they

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,880
use for react eventually for [inaudible]

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,559
software as well they used it for many years but then in

00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,600
2017 started drawing attention for some

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,240
reason and other open source

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,000
users of react in the end also apache foundation commented that

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,400
you can't amend open source licenses in this case those bsd

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,720
plus a patent clause but facebook had added was a

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,039
patent termination clause which actually isn't unheard of

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,279
now when i looked into it it's uh it's kind of similar to

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,400
what you would see in the apache license for example

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,640
but of course it was written with facebook hard coded so only

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
only facebook benefited from this termination clause

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,360
other react developers would not so it of course wouldn't work as an open

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
source license honestly i have no idea why

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,000
facebook doesn't just use the apache license it seems to do

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,919
roughly the same as they want it to do anyway let's talk about patent clauses

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,480
uh so if we look at the apache license for

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,440
example and to some extent the gpl3 is the same

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,640
they seem to be very narrowly scoped essentially apache and gpl

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
grant the minimum amount of patent rights

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
that you of course need to be able to use the software in the first place

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,760
otherwise the license would be incomplete if you would need to get like

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
a separate backup license it wouldn't be open source compliant for

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,039
sure so in the apache license such

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,159
license applies only to those patent claims

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,520
licensable by such contributors that are necessarily infringed by their

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
contributions

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:12,400
gpl has this concept of essential patent claims that do not

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,240
do not include claims that would be infringing only as a consequence of

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
further modification of the contributor version so basically saying

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
that uh yeah i licensed this software for you

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
i license all my patents that you need for this software but if you make any

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,240
modifications then actually my my license might not cover your

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,159
modifications personally this is not very open source

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
this was these licenses were created or

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,320
influenced by lawyers of large companies uh

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,600
yeah were large patent holders i should say

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,279
who benefit from only giving a very narrow license to that patents

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,640
other contributors i think would benefit from

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,400
a broader patent pool in the spirit of open invention network

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,760
for example which actually is a patent pool that

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
anybody can join uh and it's kind of a patent truce for

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
linux and a lot of other open source software

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,240
but open invention network is still a closed list so

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,000
big companies who created it at first define which software they they want to

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,760
create this kind of patent throughs for so for example linux is of course

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,240
part of it last time i looked the bsd unixes weren't

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,960
and so on when when i worked for mariadb we looked into this and it did cover

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
mysql but mariadb of course wasn't listed so

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,640
it wasn't clear whether we would have any benefit for uh to join

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,960
later actually mariadb has joined and it was added to the list

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,640
i think uh you know the in the concept that we're talking about

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,679
in this talk i think it would be great if a license

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,960
such as gpl would apply the copyleft

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,039
expansive principle to patents as well at least if you agree with me

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,679
that software patents are harmful and and we should try to fight against

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,760
them i think this could be a powerful tool let's say

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,279
you know if at minimum you know if if i get

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,520
gpl license software from you and i make some small modifications

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,080
i should still be covered and not risk patent sues from you

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,880
especially if i then contribute my modifications back to you so you can use

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,440
them and i can but i think we could go even further

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,799
uh you know there could even be a license which says that any software

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,120
kind of in the spirit of facebook tried to do uh for the benefit

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
themselves we could say that there would be a

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,159
license where any software uh licensed under this license even if

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,960
it would be completely separate things one would be an

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,559
operating system another thing would be like a javascript

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:16,240
library if you use any of this software licensed under this license

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
then you you are also prohibited from bringing patent suits

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,600
against anybody uh else contributing that have contributed software and its

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,840
license

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,480
it's a thought that excites me unfortunately it doesn't seem to excite

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,080
those who who create new licenses but maybe through this talk

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,559
i could have inspired somebody to at least think about it

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,960
so in in summary

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,679
the cryptographic autonomy license or the cal i think we can call it

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,440
extends copy left to user data

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,559
much in the spirit of the gdpr but also outside of europe

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,640
it also addresses some other issues with the hpl so it doesn't assume

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,039
that your software has a user interface for example

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:23,520
copyleft for microservice architectures i think it's still uh an unsolved

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
problem let's talk about it more and copyleft for

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,440
patents i i think is something that we should we should attack the large

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
patent holders are not gonna do it for us

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,520
so we should have licenses where the patent license is more than just for

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,320
essential claims so uh i'm available for questions we can talk

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,880
about it in the hallway track grab a drink i i like a lemon soda

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:05,840
i look forward to discussing with you thank you for listening

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:18,080
uh yeah so i think we had a lot of commentary on the why patent clauses are

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,399
the way they are let me check the shared notes do we have

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,080
like some actual questions or should we just jump into

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,000
debate here so we had one question from mccoy smith that you did already answer

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,440
in the chat i um put those here and then one other one

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,880
added in here historically gpl has not been litigated much in courts what makes

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
you think that more expansive copyleft licenses

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
would be effective in achieving what they are

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,760
trying to achieve

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,600
that's a good question and the answer is that

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,559
the gpl has worked even if it's not litigated in courts

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,320
and i i guess i've worked for some unnamed companies who also

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,840
stretched the gpl further than maybe it should have and

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,120
that also works because companies generally want to avoid

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,919
getting into court battles at all so uh i i think

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,600
in pushing boundaries in this case for good

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:31,440
not for evil as superheroes um it can be a powerful tool and and

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,679
whether some things would work in court it's a question you can ask but it's not

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,240
the most important question i see another question got added and

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,960
another direction in which extreme copyleft

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,080
is going is ethical licensing but if this was mentioned in the talk i missed

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
it it might be useful to otherwise mention

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,159
yes a great question because uh the ethical licenses

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,679
uh have indeed been a topic in recent years

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,559
uh i i think in the talk uh with the i i spoke a little bit uh about

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,000
reviewing the cryptographic autonomy license on the

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,200
osi review mailing list and

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,159
there i think there was a very clear requirement that uh

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,320
the the terms of an open source license have to somehow relate to the software

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,240
so uh so in the case of the cal license

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,039
uh the question was if we add some requirements

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,200
on the data stored by the software or produced by the software

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,000
is that going too far and and i think the reviewers

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,440
were quite strict on this question that in a way you should not have

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,799
terms outside of the like what is needed to use the software

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,480
and and that's it so so also in terms of user data uh

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,960
there was a clear consensus that you you generally should not be able to

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,520
restrict um ownership of of you of data produced by some software

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,560
and or what you can do with it how you can

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,720
publish it for example or or copy it distribute it

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,839
but nevertheless the the idea that in modern networked world if if you want

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,879
to copy if you want to use your software freedom

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,879
rights to uh to copy the software and run it

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,560
somewhere else you should be able to then have

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,000
your your data with it so so that was uh that was an interesting kind of border

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,320
case so with ethical licenses typically it's hard to see let's say a

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,480
word processor or a database uh how has does it have anything to do with

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,119
you know my my ethical values and even if i

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,560
behave badly uh or or in fact

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,920
sometimes the discussion is uh and part of the principles of the open

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,800
source division definition is that i can even

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,839
use your open source software for purposes that you would think

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,560
are unethical i i would even think are unethical

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,920
and that is certainly a principle of open source so so we

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
we cannot limit use of software uh and we cannot have unrelated

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
uh unrelated uh requirements like you know you you

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,680
should eat oatmeal every morning before you use this software

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,079
uh so that that might be healthy uh maybe ethical but it's it's not possible

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,520
for open source software thanks henry I'll go ahead and read the

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
next question that's listed in the shared notes

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,320
um would it perhaps make sense to look at this new set of problems

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,839
as part of a holistic revamp of the new licenses

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,720
with the version 4 set of licenses yeah yeah i think it would make sense

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,880
uh but i i don't think uh if you look at the

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,880
uh the process that led to gpl3 so for example it did add a patent

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
clause and and the patent clause is definitely very

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,200
narrow so i'm not sure uh that

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,560
such a mainstream license should or could or should adopt my views

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,800
maybe more likely that some new license would uh

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,359
attempt this and be interesting to even see the reaction

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,280
if such license is submitted for approval

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,800
at the osi um i i think it's i i think it's perfectly fine uh

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,200
for for gpl and the family of new licenses

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,760
uh to be a bit more conservative uh to appeal to a broader

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,480
base especially as some existing software might be upgraded to the new

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,240
version so so i think it's also important that

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,960
users and developers have some expectation of continuity

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,880
when they use software and with open source licenses

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,720
ah oh toby uh toby noticed the continuation with the

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,880
drink i almost forgot it to be honest

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,480
okay uh i should call this out mccoy smith uh is mentioning that there is a

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,160
presentation on ethical licensing later in the conference

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,760
uh okay and here's something uh so from ali

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,920
cryptographic autonomy is a term used by a number of people

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
describe the ability to absolutely control one's

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,079
keys and data so sort of the opposite of drm so

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,839
so yes i think if uh if one reads the cal license uh it does have paragraphs

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,160
about like restrictions about using uh

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,880
cryptographic keys for drm purposes for example so

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,680
from that point of view uh i could understand the name of the license

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:51,040
i think it has that's like gpl has similar clauses as well so

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,359
i think cal is actually a good general purpose license

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,359
whether or not you use crypto cryptography in your software

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,000
but uh but okay so so the point is if you think about cryptographic autonomy

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,119
as the opposite of drm uh that's actually a good summary of the

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,400
curve thank you yeah mccoy also discusses ethical

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,720
licenses and issues with points five and six in the

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,520
open source definition usually it's quite straightforward to

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,440
see how they go against this that is all of

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,119
the chat nobody is bold enough to turn on their

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,960
camera maybe toast um

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,320
yeah so so there is more on on cryptographic autonomy so that

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,520
that is why the focus was always about allowing self-hosting with no loss of

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,960
functionality or data

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,280
so i get that part i i think drm is just one thing that could limit that

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,599
yes uh so i actually haven't posted the slides yet i i need to do it uh

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,359
later i think there weren't so many slides

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,720
well jeff uh is asking why do you think we haven't had

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,599
more of a a- lgpl culture copy left in the

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,599
library world bottom up approach instead of

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,680
top down agpl culture based i think the question is whether

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,480
i'm not sure if this is what you meant but an interesting question is

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:34,160
could we use these more stronger copyleft licenses such as affair gpl

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,200
also for libraries where typically libraries are more permissively licensed

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,359
and applications might be more extreme

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,520
i yes as an extremist with my extremist hat on we we should

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,920
have done that uh so i think in the real world though

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,480
uh these choices are are made on a you know

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,040
benef calculating the benefit that if you go too far you don't get many

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,440
users um if you choose a more permissive

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
license it can be used more broadly and that's also good

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,800
for software freedom with the agpl in particular

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
as i discussed in the talk uh it is written in a way

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
which seems to assume that the software has a user interface

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,599
so if i would use it for a library

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,960
is it even effective so i think i would use them

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,319
indeed i would use the cal or there are some other

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,200
network copyleft licenses approved previously by the osi that

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,720
that could also come into play that that seemed to be more general

00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:03,839
purpose in this report

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
