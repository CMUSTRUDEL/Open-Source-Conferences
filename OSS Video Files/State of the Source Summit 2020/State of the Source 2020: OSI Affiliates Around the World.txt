all right yeah i have uh yeah so my name is samson goddy

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
i'm currently in port harcourt here i'm currently building the open

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
community in africa and i'm really excited to be here because um

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
it's really awesome to talk about open source

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
um so i don't know if i want to can i share i have like a slide i want to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,959
share to talk about the updates if you can go on please

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,319
please go ahead okay so i'm trying to look if i'm going to share my screen i

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
don't think i have access to ship screen

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:03,360
okay okay awesome and for the viewers there's a a

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,439
crisscross arrow x in the bottom right corner of the slide you may need

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,720
to hit that to make the slide large enough to actually see

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
okay can you can you see my screen now

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
you'll see my screen

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
yeah we can see it says oh awesome okay great so

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
um we as you may know the open source communities africa is a project that i

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
co-founded in 2018 um with the aim that i wanted people to

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,680
you know in africa particularly to you know not just the the definition of

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
what open source is but also in a way that make you know the

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,320
project better because i've been you know part of open

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,759
source group for about eight years now and it just makes more sense to just

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,520
start something great but one of the challenges that we wanted

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
to focus on was the fact that there was a lot of you know

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,840
community in the continent but we wanted to do something different you know

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,120
myself and my team and so we came up with this cool concept

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,039
i don't know if you could look at the screen right now

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120
so on the top you see OSCA and then you see that we're currently pushing for two

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
things which is community side and then the project side and then on

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
the community side is quite interesting because we kind of um

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
have like smaller chapter events so what we do here is

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
we give locals in different cities the opportunity to kind of like localize

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
content and do something that fits the community we

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
don't kind of like force topic or like you know some kind

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,919
of a topic that it could do but in a way that is something that fits

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,520
the um the project um but the the festival was something

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
that we did um i think february 20th to 22nd to the

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,199
open source festival so the first of our source festival on the continent and it

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,800
was really awesome we got interesting from organizations so we

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
hosted about 800 persons um out of the continent

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
in lagos nigeria for about three days and we

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
discussed about open source things from open source hardware to design

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,759
to to code contribution into programs we also push for open source program stuff

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
like you know the rpg some of code and season dots is just

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,280
really really one of the highlights of the events

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,960
um but on the project side something that we're trying to do you know

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,160
well i don't want to say thanks to COVID but COVID made a lot of things harder

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
for us so kind of switch virtually to events

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
and at the moment we're trying to create a

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,880
platform where we could onboard interesting folks that are interested in

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
open source to kind of have this whole boot camp

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,039
where they would um the creator of open source because mind

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,039
you um not trying to do something new here there are other people in africa

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
in fact there's a list on github called made in nigeria there's a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,000
awesome list of people there's like a design tool from reg.js called

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
chuck AI so there's like really awesome people doing great job in the content

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
already we're just trying to make sure that we

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,360
elevate that that just to make sure that a beginner can have an understanding of

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
what open source license is how to be the open source community and

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
also be an open source project and in order for us to achieve that we

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,800
are currently building an army i don't want to say that i mean it's

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
carrie but an army of you know advocates and also contributors

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,759
so we try to you know encourage them to contribute to you know large projects

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
and also project they're interested in but also to drive some kind of advocacy

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
so meaning you know go speak events you know try as much as

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
you can to share your passion you know Ruth was one of them

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
basically spoke about how to approach beginners in open source and she's been

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,240
doing really hard work so that's something that we're

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,520
we're kind of really proud on the open source community in africa

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,199
um so just some stats at the moment we're in five countries 11 cities and

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
over a thousand plus members um we kind of officially got december

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,080
before i think sometime around 2019 and i feel like i think um should be

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,720
double the size by now which is really awesome so these are

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
like some of the highest events we've done

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,199
across the the continents in kenya

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,240
and also spread across um so just for a brief um that you can on the

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
website oscafrica.org on twitter you can

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,160
follow us on twitter or in africa um then if we are currently uh um on the

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,639
book collective platform the open source collective platform

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,400
as a way for us to raise money if you want to join us and support

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,520
what we've been doing you could you know come on the open source collective

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,319
platform and share um look for ways that we could reach out

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
to you we could collaborate with you so i think that's basically from my end

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
i'm trying to research as short as possible without getting

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,320
interaction from the kids thank you everybody thank you samson

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,360
so um mike you are one of the most experienced would you like to go next

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
yeah sure thanks

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
so um i'll i'll try to keep it fairly short my name is mike blankfitch i'm the

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,519
executive director of the eclipse foundation

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
um the eclipse foundation has been around for 16 years

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
we're one of the sort of larger umbrella open source foundations

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
uh so it's trying to sort of talk about what we're doing from a project

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,920
perspective is kind of hard when you have 375 projects

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,519
but i'll try to just maybe touch on a couple that i think are

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,720
particularly interesting so as many developers know eclipse has its roots in

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
developer tools the eclipse ide is pretty well known

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,160
around the world but what you might not know is that

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,320
we're we have projects that are building out an entirely new development platform

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,200
um for for tooling for the web so projects like eclipse thea

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,080
which uses reuses the monaco editor that you might be familiar with from vs code

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,519
eclipse che which is building out a web-based tool set that runs on top of

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
kubernetes are basically building out an entirely

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
new platform for developer tools that you might not

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,519
be aware of another area that we spend a lot of time

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,240
in at the eclipse foundation that you might not be aware of is

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,519
iot and edge so we actually are the iot at eclipse.org is one of the largest

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,600
open source communities related to the internet of

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,160
things and then we also have a number of pretty interesting projects that are

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
doing edge computing as well so highly encourage people to look up

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
projects like eclipse kura which gives you a way to build a complete platform

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,680
for building industrial iot gateways or eclipse io fog

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,000
which is a complete stack for doing for doing edge computing

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
so that's sort of it on the project side i think from an organizational

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,760
perspective um you know again we've been around for

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,480
16 years and one of the things that's happening this

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
year that's kind of new and interesting is we are

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
picking up and moving the legal domicile of the organization

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,560
um from from the u.s to europe so eclipse has been kind of an

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
interesting thing so i'm based in ottawa canada

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,279
as are most of the staff of the eclipse foundation about two-thirds of our staff

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,040
are in ottawa one-third in europe um and uh we are uh but legally we're a

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
u.s uh non-uh non-not-for-profit uh

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
in a month or so we're going to be a belgian um

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
not-for-profit um and we're going to be in the process of moving

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
all of our sort of legal framework and governance framework

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,160
from the u.s to to europe and why are we doing that

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,560
well it turns out that we did ran some numbers and we are basically already are

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
one of the largest open source foundations

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,240
um in europe based on the number of employees the number of projects

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
70 of our committers um throughout the entire eclipse community are based in

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
europe um so we just basically decided to

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
double down on the success that we're already having

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,920
there and become a fully european organization

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,639
um and with that uh i thank you and i'll turn it back to you

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,680
thank you mike very exciting a lot of things going on in eclipse as always

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:07,519
um miles would you like to go next sure hi um i'm miles borins nice to meet

council member standards working group member at the

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,160
open js foundation who's the organization that i am representing

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,200
today on this affiliate panel the open.js foundation um exists as a

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
neutral home in center of gravity for javascript development and we host a

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,800
number of different projects um you may know some of our larger

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
projects including appium amp dojo electron jquery

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
node.js and webpack um overall i believe we have 30 plus

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
projects um within the foundation the foundation

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,279
is built um on a bed of uh

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,639
trying to create like egalitarian and open governance

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,000
um we have a cross project council that meets bi-weekly and those meetings are

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
open to anyone to attend um whether or not you

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
are a member of any of the projects in the foundation

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
um the affiliate membership that i have right now for example

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,959
is set up through our standards working group who is chartered by our cross

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,880
project council to maintain all of our

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,079
relationships with other standards and foundations organizations

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,000
um so that's something that is able to exist uh completely independently

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,440
of both the board and the top level community governed body which is pretty

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
cool um i'm pretty excited about how open

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
everything is um as a neutral home for javascript we

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,399
on top of having a number of projects um are building up uh community initiatives

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
as well standards is a great example of this

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,480
um getting involved in tc39 which is the standard body that standardizes the

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,959
javascript language can be a little bit harder

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,720
for folks to get involved in that aren't part of large organizations

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,480
um so we're setting up governance and infrastructure through an affiliate

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,279
relationship with ekma uh to allow independents and college students and

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
those who may not have access to participate in these spaces

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,519
both mentorship and support to be able to go and get involved

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
which is something i'm particularly very proud of

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
we're very interested in also like creating sustainable models for open

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
source exploring both kind of like traditional

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
foundation models um as well as like figuring out how does

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,160
that work in conjunction with new funding models

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,519
uh such as patreon or open collective or other such funding models we

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,199
are under the umbrella of the linux foundation as one of the many

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,199
foundations that kind of roll up through it

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,360
and so we work really closely with a number of different people

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,079
um i think that's a great like high level uh overview of what we're doing

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,839
as a foundation um and you know folks have any questions

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,199
about openjs i'm really happy to answer any of them

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,800
um we're a little bit of a newer foundation we've only been around for

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,760
about a year and a half we were founded through the merger of the node.js

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,920
foundation and the js foundation um and as such

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,440
we're still in the process of like reevaluating our governance still

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
kind of like iterating on how things work um so if you'd like to get involved

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
please show up and if you have ideas about how we could

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,360
do things better we're always all ears to hear it and iterate on our processes

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:27,360
thank you very much thank you um Deb, would you like to go next

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,880
sure can you hear me okay okay um so i'm deb goodkin and

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:43,199
i'm with the freebsd foundation and uh we're 501c3 which is a us classification

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,279
or tax classification for being a non-profit

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:53,440
and for the public good and our whole or sole purpose is to support the

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,079
freebsd project and community so i'm here in

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
boulder colorado and that's where we're based and

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,399
um and yes we did get quite a bit of snow

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,920
yesterday and we still have some on the ground out there and it's pretty cold

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,680
but um but anyway we were founded back in uh 2000 so

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
we're just celebrating our 20th anniversary this year

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,920
and we're 100 percent funded by donations um we so we our whole purpose like i

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,120
said before is to support the freebsd project but we

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,680
are independent of the project so um unlike

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,920
so like the eclipse foundation they have a bunch of projects under them as mike

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
was talking about earlier and um and so we're similar

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,240
except for we only have one project that we focus on

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,279
and that's our whole purpose uh we're not an

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,880
umbrella organization so the project isn't underneath us

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,839
we're um i i view us as being a you know two separate

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,120
organizations that are side by side but still all we care about is

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,400
the success of the project and supporting

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:16,559
the contributors and the development and advocacy that goes along with it

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
we have 10 board members and all around the world

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,319
and we have uh six staff members but also

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,319
a lot of different contractors who work and support

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,919
us in different efforts and the really the key areas that we support

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
are um probably most of our funding goes to

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,440
um open source software improvements and so we do have software developers on

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,480
staff and they'll do anything from stepping the uh fix

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,320
bugs to um implementing workarounds like you know security hardware uh

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,799
workarounds to implementing new features and

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,440
functionality um we also do a lot of advocacy for the

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,520
project and that's anywhere from uh doing like

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
this i i gave a short talk yesterday about the freebsd project

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,600
and we go to conferences around the world and talk about freebsd we also do

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,679
trainings and workshops and we're working on providing more

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,000
content for for that as well as for classes at

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,760
universities we also provide legal support we don't

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,960
have lawyers on our team but we do have the resources to help with if

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,640
there's any questions on like patents we can also engage in license agreements

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
and we also own the trademarks for the project

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,520
so so we're there to protect the trademarks

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,039
and we support all the freebsd infrastructure so

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,559
we purchase hardware and support it all over the world

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,200
and um and then finally we have a big effort going on with

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,679
supporting the improvement of keyway and ci and

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,520
providing a lot more automation so so really our purpose is to look at what

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,919
are the needs of the project and especially the critical needs and

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:25,280
what can we do to step in to help and that's it for me

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Hong, your muted

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,440

group so so javascript group is a huge

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
javascript in brazil however it's not just about

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,799
how brazilian jobs a group right so java so java has been supporting

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,360
several java groups around the globe such as uh conference in the whole latin

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,799
america uh also a huge number of conference to

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,559
engage the open source we are executive member of the jcp JCP

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,280
is a huge organization behind the java

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,240
and we have been helped the adopt jsr

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
where we support several java specifications such as

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,159
mod api measurement api and yes we have supported as well

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,480
eclipse foundation with several members from SO java

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,000
where we helping on the java ee new home so jakarta EE for sure

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
eclipse microprofile eclipse collection and

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,679
eclipse jnoc as well

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:10,240
yeah uh let's go to hong kong and hear from uh Samson, Sammy Fung

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,080
hi uh hi i am sammy fung from uh from open source hong kong we promote

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,440
engulf the open source community in our city which

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,760
uh collect open source project with developers

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,640
users companies and organizations like

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
um mozilla gnome drupal

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,480
as well we organized uh open source conference

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,520
uh since uh 2013 and pi con hong kong since 2015

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,280
and we also organized a hackathon and monthly

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,240
meeting as well hong kong is an international city in asia which uh

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480
which cantonese and english are our official language

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
so it actually has more overseas vistiors to

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,400
uh to listen our conference so uh for example uh a hong kong open source

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,080
conference we have a 50 uh speaker every year and and 20 of

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,600
them come from overseas uh actually so our

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,240
conference are this uh colossus for local is also for the

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,360
global community as well so i hope that we continue our work

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
and help gov the global and local open source community as well

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,200
we also have incubator program and also with a program for young to uh

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,960
to die to target different different needs

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,520
in this society as well yeah thank you

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
thank you sammy it must be late in hong kong now huh

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
what time is it over there

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:09,440
uh 9:30 told youok Thierry how about you

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,760
where are you based would you want to go next then sure

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,120
um so my name is thierry carrez i'm based

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,600
in a small village in the middle of france so heading from there it's

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,000
daytime right now so everything is good i'm the vice president of

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
engineering for the openstack foundation and the openstack foundation is a

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,440
non-profit that was created in 2012 so eight years ago now uh initially

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
to support protect and promote the openstack open

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,600
source project so very much started how the the

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,000
freebsd foundation started as well the but now we're more generally supporting

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,360
the idea of open infrastructure which is computing

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
infrastructure built using open source components

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,240
accessible to everyone and not just a couple of very large companies based

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,240
in the us or china and we're helping our community operate

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,200
those in production at a very large scale

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,039
so we continue obviously to support openstack but we also support other

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,400
projects like containers or airship or the continuous integration one

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,880
specificity of of our foundation is that projects must be openly developed and

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
openly governed that means we do not really support open

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,480
core or single vendor projects only really open collaborations and we

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
organized several events in support of those goals

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,080
uh obviously those events were highly disrupted by the coronavirus situation

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,679
but i think that affects everyone um the summit is our

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
big uh conference where everyone gathers and

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,520
we do traditional presentations and we'll have one in

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,440
october um if you want to learn more it's good it's a good way to get

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,279
introduced to what what we are providing we also

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,559
run another event called the project teams gathering

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,440
which is a venue for contributors to our projects to meet

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,559
in person and get things done and finally we

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
also have another event called open dev which is more about

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,799
community of practices trying to share their experience

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
with their peers so it's more like a an open discussion format

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
where workshop where where people um discuss around the

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,919
certain uh certain topic and and try to get as much uh experience

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,000
sharing as in the open as possible so i'll

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,760
keep it quick and that's about it thanks uh i believe anna is also uh based in

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,000
europe right anna are you ready now to start

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,400
yes thank you for coming back to me yes so i'm based in prague um

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
source fabric uh was started here and it's still

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,799
our headquarters and in fact um i don't know if folks are familiar with

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,320
source fabric we develop open source tools for the media

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,080
and we actually had our 10th anniversary as a company

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:21,840
this year and it's evolved quite a bit even just recently last year we wound

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
down our german operations which at one time

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,760
were um almost as big as the czech side um

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,960
and the other thing that has evolved uh is different maybe two if anyone had

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,880
heard of source fabric before we we really started at with a with a broad

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
portfolio of open source projects for media so

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,799
everything from book publishing to internet radio um we have a live

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
blogging tool and then there was also superdusk which

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
is you know has become our flagship

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,360
solution for news organizations it's it's a

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
it's sort of a cms it's it's a it's a headless cms

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,679
but it also coordinates workflows so it's this kind of all-in-one

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,440
kind of tool and uh just given both organizational pressures as well as

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,520
you know the market situation we really are now just focusing mainly on

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,840
on superdesk and uh and our clientele you know being in the

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,240
news media that's this weird situation um with the pandemic on

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
the one hand people are reading more news than ever

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,039
before but not paying for it and so so our customers are not in great

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,200
shape um and we are we are really trying to

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,159
kind of um adjust to that and and try to develop

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,520
uh different versions of uh superdust for example

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,279
i think a saas uh idea maybe a like a simpler version

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,960
these things are kind of being discussed but i think the other thing that we

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,440
could really really like to to kind of reboot is our developer

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
relations and our our open source community

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
relations um we do have some contributors to our

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,840
projects but i think um you know at least in my position of

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,279
course that i'm trying to communicate with the outside world

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,120
it would be really helpful for me if any if any of you

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
can suggest uh forums or ways to reach out or

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,399
or just to you know just to connect and kind of

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,399
get that connection going again be really helpful

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,159
thanks yes so this is exactly what we have the session for we want to share

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,039
tips and also try to connect everyone and i think we have one more

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,240
person to go and we can open the conversation

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,919
yeah mario yes hello everyone so um i'm representing here the FOSSASIA

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,640
community and summit so basically um FOSSASIA right like

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,799
apparently i'm not from asia but i used to live many years for

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,320
example in vietnam and like spent years in singapore and so

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,159
on so we have a very um kind of like international community

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,679
all over asia and already back in 2009 we said hey how can

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,840
we connect with everyone we have these awesome events now here like state of

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
the source but we also have foster men europe

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,480
we have other events in the u.s and our feeling was at that time

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,039
and there wasn't so much going on in asia no places where we can like bring

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
people together so we thought then let's just do it and

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,360
we got together with um other people from across yeah the

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,960
continent like for example Hong Phuc of course and um started the fossasia

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,600
summit and that was in 2009 2010 then the

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,480
first larger event and that was really great so um

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,360
it takes place every year it took place for example in cambodia in vietnam

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,799
and um we have events in china for example the open

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,480
tech summit in china and in shenzhen right like a lot of friends from

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,880
hong kong came over last time from hong kong open source and so on

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
so we're trying to overcome also these political divides and and challenges

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,720
that we see and we try just to continue to bring

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
everyone together and when people come together what

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,720
happens is they have ideas and and they say yeah let's

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,000
do something let's code something a lot of people have ideas

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,399
for example one idea was this pocket science lab here

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,480
and that was already 2015 so where somebody said and

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,960
hey we need more to do more about open science so we made some applications

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,159
and then finally we talked to developers of hardware

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,480
and yeah people collaborated and in the end right a few years later

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,000
what comes out is like an open hardware board for example another thing that i

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,679
want to mention quickly is um that people say hey we should use

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,480
open tools free open tools when we organize

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,679
events a lot of cool python tools out there

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,760
for example and we also started one 2015 which is eventyay a lot of people here

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,000
use it we already had some very good feedback back reports feature

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
requests so a lot more what we can do and yeah we

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,480
invite everyone to install it and also set it up yourself so it's on our github

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
repository and they're also mobile apps and so on

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,720
and we're actively developing it and actually have hired even a few

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,640
people and who work on this full-time and at

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,240
the moment there are many many repositories but

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,679
we're actually connecting with a lot of different communities and of

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,640
course like a lot of projects that i mentioned here in the call

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,039
we use it and kubernetes um things what you do at the eclipse

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,960
foundation and so on so thank you very much for all these projects and

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,320
great to connect with you here in this call and

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,519
yeah please check out what we do and i would like to invite you

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,440
to the next fossasia summit which will take place in march

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,360
um and um like we will make it as a mixed online

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,159
and like face-to-face event because nowadays traveling is difficult

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,640
but we have many local groups that can still meet for example in vietnam

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,480
where the situation is not that bad so um we will be able to use online tools

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,279
and mix them with with the offline tools and i think we

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,240
are um really benefiting from this event here and

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,000
from learning how to run an event online and mixed

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,120
with face-to-face meetings here so thank you very much

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,799
for this opportunity to participate yeah so uh now as we hear from everyone

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,159
uh so the conversation i want to open the discussion here

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,480
as we mentioned earlier uh tierry also would have comment on the chat

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,320
overcome a tv show bowery sound like a common pattern or drought affiliates

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
right so we all together in one network we all

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,640
cared about open source but it's tricky so it's sometimes

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,039
meeting there in conferences but what is the drive across the model where we can

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,880
collaborate so we want to hear from you what are your challenges is

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,559
anyone in the call now that you work together and would like to

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,600
collaborate in the future i heard that mike

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,720
and otavio they already have example they used to work together on some

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,919
projects like what i understand how about the audio or the orgs do you

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,279
have something that you that you would like to share how do you

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,919
see as a collaboration model moving forward or you want to learn more

00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,799
about um sourcefabrics yeah i think it's also a

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,200
new project and what's going on in hong kong

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,279
so i invite you to have the open conversation

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,880
um together and also the audience you are free to to join in you can also

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
put your question on the channels yeah

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,360
i'll talk first so with regards to collaboration it's important to note

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,879
that we already do have a lot of collaboration across our

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,639
various organizations just by virtue of the fact that we are

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,480
all using open source licenses and you know of course that's the core

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,359
mission of the osi and the biggest service that it provides to the

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,879
community is is helping uh validate that that the

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,919
licenses that we use uh enables the kind of permissionless

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,240
sharing and innovation that makes the open source community tick

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,320
um so uh so you know there's there are artificial

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,079
boundaries uh because and some of the sort of you know friction that happens

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,639
between organizations is because places like eclipse and apache and so on

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,960
have sort of well-defined ways of what we mean

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,000
you know what does it mean to be an eclipse project or an apache project so

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
there's some sort of cultural impedance mismatch but it but

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,200
at the same time um you know the eclipse foundation

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,079
uses a ton of software from places like apache

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,280
and the linux foundation and and many others and i'm

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,760
in you know i'm sure many other folks use use stuff from eclipse

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,880
so uh just sort of start off by saying that yeah there

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,760
there are some um and maybe thierry can kind of elaborate on what he meant by

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
artificial boundaries and yet of course it's you know it's not a

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,320
perfect world but just wanted to start off by saying that

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,200
the licenses that we use and enables an enormous amount of sharing and

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,680
collaboration that would be impossible without them

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,880
and you know by the way thanks for the os to the osi

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:44,800
for helping enable that and being on on mission on that for over 20 years yeah

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,760
um i'll give some precision what i meant about artificial boundaries it's more

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,760
around boundaries between countries and cultures and

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
the fact that we all want to collaborate together at the same time but it's

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,160
very challenging to organize a community an open source community that is truly

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,480
worldwide uh it's relatively easy to

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,880
to like europe and the us it's relatively easy but as soon as you add

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,320
china or india to the mix it becomes a real challenge

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,720
uh getting people to to meet uh getting people to agree on things

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,640
uh using the same tools and and and i can see also how the political

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,839
context the political context sometimes uh

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,320
distracts us from from this

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,240
collaborations without boundaries you know uh and

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,480
and like uh the eclipse foundation moving from the us to europe

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,960
to get closer to that where their the main contributor base is

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,200
um or or us having to try to visit a lot of countries with

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,800
with the events that we organized so that nobody is left behind

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,520
um it would be easier if the earth were flat but it's not the case

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,359
yeah if only we all lived in the same time zone

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,440
and spoke the same language and shopped at the same stores and ate at the same

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,000
restaurants

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,079
but it would be conference time all the

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,480
time yeah and i find it even more challenging

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,680
during the COVID time how you've plan to travel to places to meet

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,440
people what can we do to to keep up with the

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,960
engagement as you mentioned that it's difficult to connect with people

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,720
in in china or somewhere in asia sammy are you facing the same challenge

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,359
how do you um keeping yourself engaged and connect

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,200
a hong kong society with other projects are there

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,400
any collaboration going on between you and somebody here already

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,040
actually i think that uh hong kong is is is also mainly affected by the

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,760
coronavirus and pandemic so uh

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,280
so we we only can organize uh us and our activities online and work

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,599
well and virtually just like uh uh uh i will going to organize the uh

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,560
pycon hong kong in november is also full fully

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:30,640
hosted in virtual space yeah

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,599
so i think this is our main concern about our

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,920
gatherings this year but uh but i don't know what's happened and

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,359
what is the change in hong kong after the uh the coronavirus

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,720
pandemic so even we don't know what happens in

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,440
hong kong this month yeah so let's see what's happened

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,160
i guess to the whole community right now we have a bunch of online

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,119
conference right so i think that's opposites right now we are like

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,680
over helmets of uh conference

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,800
meetups online meetups because right now it

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,720
is easier to bring some people to brazil virtually

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,320
right so i can invite some people from europe to just do a presentation the

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,960
biggest issue right now is just a time zone

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,240
right because brazil we are uh right now it's 11 a.m probably it's

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,000
a little bit late on

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,359
europe and early to us but beside that is it's easier to bring more people to

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,839
meetups conference and it makes it hard to

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,079
coordinate too much confidence that's happening right now

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
actually i think it's been kind of uh sorry go ahead sammy

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,040
oh yeah he's also advantage in

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,800
in this case because of we move everything to

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:26,079
to the virtual space actually i also organized the

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,760
uh another pycon hong kong spring versions

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,240
in may this year i tried to uh collect more

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,640
speakers from other country so yes the time zone is

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,440
one of the concerns so so i think

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,119
uh more time to do the conference starting from a

00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:00,000
morning in hong kong and then uh of the

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,319
hong kong i also need to host some session from the uh overseas

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,319
speaker from just like google and also american as

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,359
well yeah so is a challenge

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,680
we've noticed like so we we're making eclipsecon virtual this year

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,839
and the registrations are way higher than we have in the past for

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,640
um for the in in person event and the thing that i find really intriguing is

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
something like 80 percent of the registration so far

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,400
are new people who have never been to an eclipse con

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,920
before and so there's pluses and minuses and a lot of

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,280
the different things that are happening and one of the pluses i think is

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
is that we're because we're switching everything to virtual

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,839
um it's easier to attract in some ways easier to attract new people um and and

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,240
make contact with folks that might not have been able to travel to an in-person

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,280
event so it's you know of course lots of things

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,720
are changing but some of the things are some of the results are positive as well

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,880
as as negative and of course i miss uh sitting down and

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,040
having a beer with somebody because that's uh

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,839
that's you know sort of the definitely part of being human

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,160
um in part of building the human relationships that keep our communities

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,520
going um but there are some pluses to the

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,319
changes as well

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,160
yeah i don't know if you can comment i think i agree there because the

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,359
the same thing um i've been sort of like questioned because again it's a large

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,359
continent right so 1.3 plus billion people

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,040
and i just live in one side of the continent with you know different time

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,319
zone i think there's up to about four time zones in

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,560
africa and then like a lot of languages so what i would say uh so just to

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,599
address uh thierry's um i think or statement yeah i

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,640
would say that you you will be still a lot of folks coming from the continent

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,119
africa because you know one of the challenges of

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,119
in-person conference was the the difficulty of flying over like

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,160
personally i travel a lot so i spend on an average of uh

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,240
10 hours to fly to the u.s and maybe fewer depending on where i'm going

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,359
in europe but one of the hardest thing that i've seen um

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,640
a lot of contributors particularly maybe it's maybe something

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,640
you might have seen in your organization is like that it's very difficult

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,079
for some africans to get visa to fly down to europe

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,000
which is which is you know something that i think would

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,440
would stop anytime soon but i would say um

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,040
you know like the event itself you've seen you know greater presentation

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,800
um but for us um in the open source into african space

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,920
we've been having some challenges because um

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,839
we're again struggling to have one event where you know

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,880
from south africa you know kenya in west africa and also north africa can

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,920
you know all come together to have a conversation

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,440
but always this issue of you know language because in the northern part of

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
the country if the country is heavily influenced by arabic why

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,240
someplace in eastern africa is yeah english but huge quality and

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,359
west africa is a bit of a disaster because there's portuguese

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,480
there's french there's english you know there's like a lot of languages there

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,800
which is a bit crazy but i think one of the things that we've

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,440
been um encouraging folks within the community

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,800
is go and you know apply to speak at events um to also share things that

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,520
i've been working on uh you know there have been great lists

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,599
from folks from the continent already in those

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,040
events itself which has been really awesome so if you

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,160
this is kind of like an act for me if you're interested in

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,079
trying to understand the space more on the continent uh you can feel free to

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,200
reach out to me or to reach out to OSCA info@oscafrica.org

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,040
i could drop in a chat or you could follow me on twitter and ask me the

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,880
question because it's a it's a huge space to to to figure out

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,200
all along i'm still figuring out something though

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,720
so i'm looking at the time so i want to go back to

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,079
the question that anna has earlier and see

00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,800
if we can give some feedback anna you um was asking to get some resources

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,880
and connect back with the community would you like to

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,560
add anything there and if the people here can

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,599
provide some input

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,720
yeah um i mean my disadvantage is that i'm not i'm not a developer

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,160
myself um so i'm just trying to think of what be relevant i mean we mostly

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,160
develop in python um and

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,440
uh js and react and those are the things that come to mind first and apologies of

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,000
um i got anything wrong there but uh yeah i think that's and i think with our

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,119
um our publishing solutions we're really looking towards

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:03,200
more progressive web app uh technology so um yeah and anything also

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,240
that kind of brings together uh you know news organizations or media technology

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,839
and open source um would be helpful to folks know

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,839
anything there

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,640
do we have anyone in in the call knowing any similar

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,839
organization that uh working on open source publishing solutions or media

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,160
view

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:43,599
that we can have to connect with anna perhaps in your um

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,119
so i know there is a group in belgium actually there is the

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,720
uh open publishing uh group from constant i don't know if you

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,520
um aware of them but uh they're they used to hold the

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,960
um libra office over there and they're quite

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,200
a bunch of people working in that so i can look up again and see if i

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,280
i can connect you over there yeah so that would be great yeah and

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
i'll sorry i'll just put my my email in the chat so if anybody

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,720
thinks of anything later they can they can send it on thank you

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,240
okay thank you can i ask you a question

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,160
so it's actually a question for mike and i'm curious at

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,480
um if if most of you are based in ottawa why you became a us based corporation

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,359
and the second um i didn't catch why you're moving to belgium

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,200
belgium so uh so it was actually the other way around

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,440
uh so okay it's well the original eclipse project

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,920
um the what became the eclipse ide um the people who built that were about

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,200
two-thirds in ottawa one-third in switzerland

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,400
um and when they went to recruit created the eclipse foundation and went to

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,920
recruit for an executive director i threw my hat in the ring and i had a

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,160
previous uh affiliation with with the team and ended up getting the

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,400
job so it was more like the other way around the the

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,240
eclipse foundation had already been legally created and they recruited me

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,720
as the executive director and then i built the team around

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,760
i wasn't moving so and then and the move to europe was basically motivated

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,880
because um we we like a challenge in a board

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,200
meeting about hey you know eclipse foundation is doing all

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,800
kinds of stuff in europe take a look at and how you could do more and we found

00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,760
out that 70 of our paying members are in europe

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,800
70 percent of our committers are in europe one-third of our staff is in

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,640
europe why and we actually and the european

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,800
commission seemed to be very interested in

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,960
in in a lot of open source initiatives so we became to the conclusion that

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,720
europe could use an open source foundation of international reach and

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,319
reputation and so we decided that hey let's just

00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,960
double down on this um and so it's always nice to think that

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,040
there's a in these days that there's a sort of a

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,760
geopolitical backstory to uh to these kinds of things but it really was

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,319
basically a business decision it's like we we came to the realization that

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,880
we had gradually become european and decided to just sort of take the final

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,800
step um and and it's also an interesting

00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,720
differentiator because you know the linux foundation

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,000
the apache software foundation the mozilla foundation not only are they

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,520
you know us-based they're all california-based um so it's

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,680
uh just a it's so it's an interesting way to be a little bit different

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,800
are you and are you gonna keep your us-based

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,200
um organization are you moving 100 to europe

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:48,160
it's okay good this is a process not an event um but yes the goal is we

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,920
eventually will become 100 european i just couldn't tell you i

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,040
just i i can't tell you how long that process

00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,960
is going to take okay thank you yeah my

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,359
pleasure

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,000
uh i think jen do we still have time i think i got the signal that

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,079
we need to get ready for the um the next session

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,520
um five minutes remaining in this session

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,960
and then a five minute break till the next okay cool

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,839
thank you

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,200
okay so let me see if we have any questions

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,319
from the audience

00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,839
look at the chat

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,640
osi is the place where we uh what we can have you so um

00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,920
because of the time zone and you mentioned we also try to

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,599
uh engage with others we will not be able to get everyone here but

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,839
you know we are the place of contact if you um at one point one to

00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,359
establish connection with all the [...] in our network we'd be very

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,359
happy to be um the bridge and that had people

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,640
to to kind of collaborate and work on um

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:23,520
work together on more projects um so i i don't see any

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,960
question on the chat

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,319
well i would be um interested maybe if um

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,520
we just share like as of as final words was our plan for the next few months

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,359
and what's the plan of others and as as this progresses for example i also find

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:48,000
it interesting apart from the um challenges

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,240
of running online events and then you know

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,800
travel challenges i think more or less we are more aware of this

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,559
but how do we come like social challenges

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,400
i mean like we see what's happening in the U.S. and we see what's happening in

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,040
hong kong and maybe can we do anything i mean like

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
also everywhere in the world right parts of

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,880
europe and brazil and so on so what can we also like for

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,480
example support other communities here in that

00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,800
way that we are linked through with the source i

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:25,520
osi because i think free and open source is always also a um like there's a

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,040
motivation behind it people you know have this idea

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,000
of sharing instead of only doing competition

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,359
we collaborate with each other and we share and

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:40,000
it's kind of a positive mindset and how can we transfer this mindset and how can

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,400
we maybe help each other possibly maybe

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,839
it's a bit too much in a few words but like i would be interested

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,079
yes i think it's a great suggestion to end the session so what is your plan in

00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,280
the upcoming months or next year and is there

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,960
anything that you want the community to help you or any challenge that you like

00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,800
to raise so i guess each person can take a minute

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,920
for this ending words well i'm not on mute so i'll go first

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,839
so upcoming events and and uh topics finishing up this migration to europe of

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,760
course is consuming a lot of time um at the organizational level uh

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,559
eclipsecon is coming up in october and that's going to be a

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,000
a big focus area and we're really looking forward to

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,359
gathering as much of our community as we can in october

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:37,920
at eclipsecon uh and then um you know in terms of the community um

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,119
you know if you're thinking of bringing an open source

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,400
project to a foundation uh please keep us in mind and give us a give us a drop

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,160
us a line and maybe we can talk to you about why you might

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,960
want to bring your project to the eclipse foundation

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,359
uh in hong kong uh we are going to organize the pycon hong kong fail

00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,920
uh in november  so we will start the uh call for

00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,000
proposal this week yeah and hopefully uh

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,920
we uh we will do some planning for next year

00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,839
as well

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,119
um am i looking forward uh how

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,480
how to organize a hackathon as soon as possible

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,240
yeah because being within to current pandemic

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,359
situations is difficult to organize a hackathon

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,599
um for the openstack foundation the next big step is our event the open

00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,480
infrastructure summit that will be virtual

00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,799
in october uh the week of the 19th um i put the link in the in the shared
