good morning good afternoon and good evening my name is mccoy smith

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,440
from portland oregon in the united states i'm here to talk about patents

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
specifically i'm going to talk a little bit about the history of patents

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,560
in the united states and its impact on free and open source software

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,519
as well as doing a little bit of prediction of where the future may hold

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,960
and things that may need to be done as a result of the

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
developments over the years first of all i got to start with a legal

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
disclaimer a bit tongue-in-cheek i am a united

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,079
states lawyer i'm also a united states patent lawyer

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,280
and a canadian patent agent but i am not your lawyer which means

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
if you have questions about legal problems or issues or patents

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,320
or any other topic please consult with your own lawyer

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,440
i have also simplified a lot of concepts here

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,840
uh compressed timelines etc for the ease of this presentation to make

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
the points clearer given the timelines limits that we have of the half hour

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
here i kind of had that had to do that please

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
don't quibble if i didn't get the facts exactly the way that you think

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
they are it could be just because i did i

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
compress things for the ease of presentation

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,119
so first i'd like to start talking a little bit about the history of patent

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,600
law in the united states and how it relates to

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,119
open source software uh starting with a brief

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,759
early history of software and patents many people think that patents

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,119
and software really only came into being in the 90s that is

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,360
completely incorrect in fact software patents predate software

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
copyrights in terms of the first filings of those

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,439
two forms of intellectual property related to software

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,960
um software patents really only got their first test

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,119
in the 70s uh in the united states courts there's a

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,880
case called Gottschalk v. Benson which is really the kind of the first

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,800
patent-ish case related to software in that case the supreme court in the

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
united states found that this specific patent was related to an

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,520
abstract idea it was not patentable but a few years later in a separate case

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
Diamond versus Diehr we had the united states supreme court

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
first validate that one could pursue a patent related

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
to software and that it wasn't abstract in a way

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,080
that made it ineligible for patenting now that doesn't mean that

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,160
in 1981 was the first time a patent was ever valid

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,440
or issued in the united states as i mentioned before

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
since the 60s people have been filing software patents

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
there are in fact many thousands of software-related patents

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,239
in the united states before the 1980s there was a development in 1990s a case

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,959
called state street bank which really most people think of

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,159
is opening the u.s patent system to software patents

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,760
but they were not first allowed then it was actually much earlier than that

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
now let's talk a little bit about the history of

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
free and open source software licensing and patents um

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
the earliest uh free and open source software licenses the bsd and mit

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,440
have a degree of ambiguity about the patent rights conveyed using them

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
and there continues to be a debate about this issue to this day

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,599
nearly 40 years after those licenses were first drafted

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,159
i've provided in the materials links to a couple of articles published within

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,440
the past three years in which there have been debates about

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,760
the scope of patent grants in bsd and mit they're worth reading if

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
you're interested in this topic but in the 90s much more

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
careful foss patent licensing started to develop

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,239
and you saw the newer licenses have much more clear and explicit

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
language around the patent rights that were conveyed

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,879
anytime you use one of those licenses so most of the more popular newer licenses

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,840
apache mozilla eclipse and gplv3

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,560
all have patent language in them now one way to look at the problem or

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,360
the issue of patents in free and open source software

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
is to divide the sort of patent holding players

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,800
into different types and here is an example in my mind of how

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
a good way of looking at that so on the far left you have

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,199
participants in an oss project who practice or have products as well as own

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,520
patents on the far right you will have a entity that practices

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,560
and has products as well as patents but they may not be a participant in a

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,759
particular open source project under a particular

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,039
license and then in the center bottom you have

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
entities who don't have any particular product or

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,280
business other than owning patents they simply

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,000
own patents for the purpose of asserting

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,919
those patents and collecting royalties as i discussed before uh many of the

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,400
newer open source licenses include express patent language about

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
the patent rights that are conveyed the older ones there's a debate about

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,600
the degree of patent rights that are conveyed

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
but in the the group of companies that own patents and who participate in oss

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
project many of the patent issues are dealt with

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
by the license itself so the patent grant and the osi approved license

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
because those companies are participating in that project

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,319
they will have conveyed some degree of patent rights to the project

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
now i'd like to talk a little bit about patent pledges

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,120
so this was something that was quite in vogue in the early 2000s

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
where you had a number of different patent holding

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,840
companies make various statements about their

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,639
non-desire to assert their patents against some form of

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
free and open source software red hat and ibm are two examples of companies

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759
that did that but there were many more throughout the technology industry

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,600
that did this in the early 2000s this was mainly done because there was

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
considered to be a patent threat to significant open

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
source projects like linux and these companies wanted to get out front and

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,199
say by the way we're not interested in inserting our

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
patent rights against these projects or other

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
forms of open source software there was also

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,720
a coordinated efforts within the industry to get together

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,080
and make agreements amongst industry players that they collectively would not

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,080
make patent assertions against certain types of free and open source

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,160
software the two best examples of that is the open invention network which

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
the members of that make a pledge not to assert their patents against something

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,960
called the linux system definition there's a smaller organization called

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
pax which makes a similar pact amongst the

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
participants that they won't assert patents

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120
against android

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,120
so if you look at our charts of patent holding entities the pledge the various

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
forms of pledges that were made by patents

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
include both the participants in open source

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,039
projects who own patents as well as potentially companies who are

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,639
non-participants in those projects but nevertheless want to make some sort

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,360
of pledge that they will not assert patents

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
against them so as you can see here now there's another restraint against

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
using patents which although it's not discussed a lot i

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,759
think it very much is in play and i could like i call that good

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,240
community citizenship so you know there are many many

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
companies in the technology industry these days

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,759
who in some way either participate in or rely on free and open source software

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
as part of their products it's part of their services

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,159
or part as part of their business and many of them i think have come to

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,640
realize that it would be highly detrimental to those businesses

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,519
if they were to start asserting patents against

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
free and open source software in general so

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
many of them i think are constrained and don't assert patents is

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
because they know it would be harmful to their own businesses that rely on free

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,160
and open source software um there can also be a degree of

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,000
developer pressure in this um i think that many companies feel that

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
when if and when they start making patent assertions against free and open

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,959
source software they're going to have a very hard time

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,920
getting developer cooperation on the projects that are important to

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,440
them so for example will the developer community

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,200
um allow or be helpful in getting their contributions

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,560
upstream if they are perceived to be a patent

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,160
threat i think that's probably a concern that many companies have

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
and a reason why they don't assert patents

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
another constraint is something that the open invention network does

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
which is that their defensive patent portfolio

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,360
which is advertises being designed as something that may be asserted against

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,040
an entity that asserts its own patents against free and open source software

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,800
that's never as far as i know been done but it is a potential constraint

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,519
so as i said good community citizenship it's something that i think does

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,079
constrain patent assertions both by companies that are participating

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,640
in a particular project or who those companies that don't

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,000
participate but otherwise rely on those projects

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,279
and that may also serve as a form of constraint against patent assertions

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,000
that sort of fills up this pie of the potential threat of patents

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,160
against free and open source projects another interesting constraint here and

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,640
this is something you've somewhat seen bear out historically

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,600
is that many of the fights that involve patents and are in some way related to

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,120
free and open source software are really two large companies

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,440
fighting against one another over um businesses or

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,120
products that they compete with one another on

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,760
uh oracle at versus google is a good example of that everybody thinks of that

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
as a software api case and that's the case

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
it's up in front of the supreme court right now

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,800
but there were also some patent claims in them that got dismissed fairly early

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,560
in the case there are other cases of that sort but

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,279
in many cases you will see free and open source software be part of

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
a patent litigation between two big companies

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,839
but these disputes don't tend to spill over

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,279
into the broader ecosystem of those free and open source software

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,640
packages it's just a fight between two big companies

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,240
posturing against one another and using patents as part of that fight

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720
so the family fights between two big companies or bigger companies against

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,680
one another is another tends to be a bit of a

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,800
constraint against patent assertions against the larger

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,079
ecosystem so as you can see here i'm starting to

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
fill in a lot of the patent potential patent assertions

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
in two categories of patent holders those companies that do participate in a

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
particular project and those companies that may not

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,200
participate in a particular project but otherwise have businesses

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
that are impacted by patent assertions or

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,959
businesses that are dependent on free and open source software

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,360
and as you can probably surmise from the way that i put these charts together

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,440
there is a big glaring hole here and that's the one i've highlighted in this

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
slide which is the companies that really don't

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
have any business other than owning patents and asserting

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
patents

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,880
those companies really aren't constrained by any

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,800
historical constraints against patent assertions

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,959
versus free and open source software

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
so the entities the non-practicing entity entities or

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
sometimes often called pejoratively patent trolls

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,639
are the entities that really don't have any businesses other than

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,440
owning patents and asserting patents they don't really ever rely upon or

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,839
care about free and open source software they're just there to monetize the

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,639
patent assets that they hold now there what is one slight constraint

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
against these companies and it's a relatively new development called the

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,880
license on transfer network and this is a large group of companies

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,560
that have banded together and have pledged to one another that if

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,600
they sell a patent from their patent

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
portfolio to an entity that has no business other

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,000
than asserting patents then everybody who participates in that

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
organization automatically gets a license to that

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,519
patent so in other words it's sort of an anti

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,279
not a non-practicing entity agreement

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,560
to prevent the sale of patents to entities that may use them merely for

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
monetization

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,680
so this can be somewhat of a constraint against these non-practicing

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
entities the problem is most non-practicing entities

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,279
are not going to be in the market for patents that are encumbered by the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
license on transfer pledge they're really looking to either develop

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,320
their own patents or to buy them on the market

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,160
where there is no such encumbrance against the patent rights

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
you can see here the non-practicing entities there may be a little bit of

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
constraint against asserting patents against free and open source software

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,560
due to the license on transfer network but for the most part it isn't

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,360
dealing with many of the patents that these entities hold

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
now i'm going to talk a little bit about the more recent history of

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,680
patent patents and software patents um there have been a number of cases in

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,600
the past 10 years that have tried to deal with

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,240
the extent to which patents directed to software

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
ought to be patentable in the first place i've listed a bunch of the

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
cases here and i have links in the materials they're not worth going

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,680
through other than to say that

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
the courts have struggled with to what extent a

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
patent directed to software actually can be granted

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,399
they actually have invalidated a number of software patents but they haven't

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,120
invalidated them all and there are some cases through the

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
appeals courts in the united states where software patents are being

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,959
validated as patentable this has also

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,600
led to many patent lawyers adjusting the way they present their claims

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
and the patent document itself so that it will

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,880
test it will pass these tests that have been set up by the courts

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,839
and that has been sort of borne out by data from the patent offices

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,240
which show that software patents have been increasing in volume

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
year over year over the past decade to decade and a half

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,079
there's also a very recent case last month or actually two months ago

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,399
that is again testing the boundaries of this idea of what

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
is or isn't abstract and what is or isn't patentable

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
it's called american axle that may be headed to the supreme court so we may

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,880
get yet another analysis of this issue that may bear upon a

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,160
software patent eligibility so now i want to talk a

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,720
little bit about the history of challenging patents that may

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,639
constitute a threat to free and open source software

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
i've listed here a number of initiatives that were launched

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,480
primarily in the early to mid 2000s that were designed to either create

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,240
prior art that could be used against threatening software patents that were

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,039
potentially going to be asserted against foss or to actually go out and try to

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,559
invalidate these patents um a lot of this activity was

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:22,160
reactive essentially attempting to react to patents that already existed or

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
were perceived as a threat they weren't particularly proactive

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,280
a lot of them also have become inactive there have been successful challenges to

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,679
patent patents relative to software by some of these entities over the years

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:44,640
but they've been fairly limited over 15 years

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
okay so that's a little bit of the history now i'm going to talk a little

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,679
bit about my perception of the future in this area

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
as i mentioned before i think i think the biggest glaring hole

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
that is a potential problem for free and open source software

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,320
going forward in the future is these non-practicing entities who amass

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
patents have no business other than asserting

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
the patents and are looking to gain royalties through assertions or

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
the requests for licenses to those patents

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,440
now for a very long time we did not see a whole lot of activity

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,000
around these non-practicing entities against free and open source software

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,679
that was mainly because they were tending to want to chase the

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,880
for-profit products of large companies because they saw that that was the best

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,200
place to get royalties they also probably perceive free and

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
open source software something that was given away for free

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,760
or without royalty and therefore there was going to be a hard time asking for

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,960
money for something like that but we have seen

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,640
very recently some activity that may indicate that

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
that mindset has gone away a lot of people

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,080
may be familiar with the assertion against GNOME by

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,160
an entity called the rothschild there's also another

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,679
entity called soundview that's going out and make

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,120
asserting patents against companies some of these patents are said to be

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,919
directed to open source packages such as hadoop

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
now in the case of these companies or these entities

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,520
non-practicing entities the only real vehicle you've got to deal with

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
them is to challenge their patents because they're not going to sign up for

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,840
a pledge they're not going to execute or

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,039
participate in a project and therefore commit their patents

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
under an open source license they're really just

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,240
looking to monetize a patent asset that they hold

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,600
now it is possible that's one of the reasons why the gnome

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,160
litigation was settled there was a fairly strong statement at the beginning

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,080
of this that litigation by the gnome foundation that

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,039
they were prepared to challenge those pat

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,960
the patent that was being asserted and there was an entity called unified

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,440
patents that put out a competition to gather prior

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,559
art so there was a strong position that was given in that

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,360
litigation that the patents would be challenged

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
and that may have been a factor and resulted in the settlement in that case

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,520
and the license that was granted in that case

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,360
to all software under a free and open source software license

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,720
okay so now i want to talk a little bit about how you do go about challenging

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,400
patents there's three main ways of challenging a

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,520
patent in the united states for validity the first is whether it's

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,120
eligible be to be patented in the first place and in

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,960
the case of software that challenge is essentially whether or not the subject

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,799
matter being pursued in the patent is quote unquote abstract

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,360
under the various tests that the courts have set out in the united states

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,240
there are other tests that can be done and these are based on prior art either

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,480
is it novel so is it identical to a piece of prior art that existed before

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
the patent or something called obviousness in the

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,080
united states an inventive step in europe and other countries

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,320
essentially based on the prior art that existed before the patent

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,000
is it merely an obvious extension of that a little bit about where you can

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,799
challenge your patents the first and the most legislature to

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,559
make them not eligible for patenting there was a time

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,080
in the early 2000s where people thought that they had a chance of convincing

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,000
various legislatures including the eu to make software patents ineligible

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,400
but that has gone kind of by the wayside and i don't think there's any

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,840
potential for any legis major legislature in the

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
in the world to say that patents on software

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,200
will never be eligible for patenting which means there are a couple other

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
ways that you wind up having to challenge patents one is in the u.s

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,080
court system in the u.s is the federal court system

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,640
isn't valid please invalidate it that's not enough in the united states

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
and in the courts in the in the united states you can challenge it

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,679
on any basis it could be prior art it could be abstraction it could be any

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,520
any many other ways of course the problem with the

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,159
us court system it is very expensive so most patent litigation united states is

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,880
going to cost millions of dollars to resolve if you

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
take it all the way to the end

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,640
now the cheaper and potentially easier way to challenge a patent is

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
through the united states patent office and there are a couple of different ways

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,880
to do that there's a new procedure that's only been around for about 10

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,559
years called inter parties review you've probably heard of this ipr um

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
if you want to do that you have to do it based on

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,960
prior arts you can't challenge something based on being

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,799
a software patent based on it being abstract cost

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,799
hundreds of thousands of dollars so they're not

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,559
entirely cheap but they can be cheaper than having to go

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,640
through the court system united states there's also a challenge called

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,520
post grant review again that's also been placed only within the past 10 years or

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,559
so and in that case you can challenge for any basis of validity so it can be

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,480
prior art it can be that the claims are abstract the problem with

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
this is you have to file them very early it's got to be within nine

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,760
months of the patent being granted these sorts of challenges also

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,520
potentially can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,880
there's a another form of challenge that is actually

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
quite cheaper it's only tens of thousands of dollars

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,840
it's called re-examination again that can only be done based on prior art

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,240
you can file it at any time but unfortunately it's a very one-sided

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
procedure you basically get one chance to make your

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,919
claim that the patent is so now i'm going to do a little bit of

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,840
prediction here or projection of what i think probably

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,760
people ought to be thinking more strongly about

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,039
which is what should we do in the case here

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,120
of patents that be are being asserted against free and open source software

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
and i've broken this down into best middle and worst case

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,080
so the best case here is um if that's the case then what has

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,919
been done so far is probably sufficient you deal on

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,120
assertions like a gnome on a case-by-case basis

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,200
you don't have to have a comprehensive policy to deal with these problems

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
now the medium case scenario is you've got a few large

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
practicing patent holders that remain threat so either

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,039
i think if that's the case there may be a need to revive

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,120
and or redo the various initiatives that were instituted in the early 2000s

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,640
to deal with patents that were held by non-practicing

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
entities ones that were either designed to

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,600
develop prior art against those patents or ones that

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,120
were designed to actively file challenges to those

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,400
patents either in the court system or through

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,080
the patent office and finally the worst case scenario is

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,400
rather than having the practicing and patent holder entities uh generally

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,559
leave false alone you start to see them being more active

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,600
in the asserting patents against foss you also see the non-practicing patent

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,120
holders ramp up so they start to see free and open

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,799
source software because it's so ubiquitous and used by

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,520
so many different companies as a prime target for their assertions

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,720
of their patents in order to gain royalty in that case if

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
that's the worst case or we develop the worst case scenario

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,919
i think there's probably going to be the need

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,000
to develop a new industry sponsored and highly

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,559
funded entity whose sole purpose is to develop prior art

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,720
find prior art find patents that are held

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,279
by entities that may represent a threat to foss

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,440
and to take aggressive uh action against those pats to do what

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,440
they can to invalidate or narrow the scope of

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
those patents mind to a lot of people well i'm not a

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,279
lawyer what what actually can i do to help him to help address this problem

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,360
and there really are a couple of things that you can do

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,760
number one is the more prior art there is out there

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,520
the easier it's going to be to challenge these sorts of patterns

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
and the way prior art is created is by documentation

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,320
of new developments in technology publishing those developments in a

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,919
in a way where one can be certain of the date when that was

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,480
published another way that you can help is help to

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
locate prior art when there is a need for it

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,039
there is a bounty program that has been done by for example unified patents they

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,399
offered a bounty for good prior art against the

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,440
rothschild patent that was asserted against gnome

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
look out for that and see when you see them announcing bounty programs

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
for prior art that are directed to patents relevant to free and open source

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,440
software there may be some money in it for you

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
and you may help develop a defensive case against a patent that's a problem

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,200
to free an open source software and finally one thing to be

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,720
aware of is the political end of these things

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,279
there's a thing called the inventors rights act of 2019 that was introduced

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,600
last year it would help to monitor that and if you feel like you want to be

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,880
political let your representative know if you're

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,760
in the u.s your feelings about this sort of thing

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,320
okay so that's basically the presentation i'm going to put a little

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,679
plug in for a book that's going to be coming out

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,799
early next year from oxford oxford university press

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,440
author co-author on a couple of chapters on this including the patent chapter

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
if you want more detailed information on these subjects

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
think about purchasing this book when it comes out next year

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
so that's the end of the presentation and i think we'll open it up live

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,640
now for questions from the audience or industrial interests

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,640
who might be willing or the criteria for characteristics

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,640
organizations who might be willing to fund the sort of

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,520
large proactive all vectors attacks on patents

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,559
against foss

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:08,320
um yeah i i think the problem is that

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,640
most organizations have kind of done their own things

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,679
i mean OIN is sort of a unified thing but they haven't really been

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,440
all that active in doing the sort of things that i talked about which is

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
actually aggressively going out challenging patents

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,159
um OIN might be a good vehicle for that or something like OIN

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,960
which is really designed to be a patent attack entity

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,919
uh is something that i think may be needed

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,039
in the future if if things go the wrong way

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,640
so what i'm guessing is that the uh the driver for your worst case scenario

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,039
would be precisely that rather than being seen as a sort of

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,840
non-commercial hobbyist activity uh trying to begin to recognize that

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,880
it's the world's biggest most valuable companies and it's

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,320
like five of the world's five most valuable companies now are massive users

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
of open source and so i take your point about they've

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
already got their own protections in place but

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
very few of those protections are effective against the

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,080
fully isolated non-practicing entities because there's no way to cross license

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,960
there's no way to do anything so it's it would seem that there might be an

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,919
interest there to uh to pursue either on a consulting

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
basis so then let the really big guys do a company by

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,039
company but certainly the mid-tier the next sort of

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,399
100 companies who are vulnerable to this may not

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,919
wish to specialize men that will spend their executive bandwidth uh but might

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,159
be willing to fund an external spaceless center i don't

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,960
know if congregations an economic argument that

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
this thing must exist it's like how to find it is a different

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,159
question of course yeah i think i think what what needs to

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,919
happen is there needs to be more of a perceived threat than it

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,799
currently is i mean if if you just have a no gnome case every five years

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,159
then it's probably not perceived that the patent

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,080
assertion entities are all that big of a problem and they'll deal with those on a

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,840
case-by-case basis

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,000
the response to the to the threat it's i'm talking about what happens if your

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,919
your worst case scenario comes true um is it is there

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,919
have you thought about what that path what the way of recruiting

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,200
large deep pocketed partners might look like because of course that's

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,120
yes it's only that situation the question arises

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,000
uh well you know one way of doing that is making a presentation at state of the

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
source and having people go back to their employers and say hey i heard a

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,039
very interesting presentation you ever thought about this idea

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,679
right i know a guy who's thinking about it

00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,720
job done

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,799
thank you okay so somebody asks you and i spoke a few years ago at the same

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,000
5g event any room for foss in that patent infested thicket

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,039
uh this is a a slightly different issue i think which

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,919
is the uh development of open source software

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,720
within standard setting bodies that have a royalty collection

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,360
patent licensing scheme and that's yet another complex issue

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,240
where you have competing interests amongst the large commercial companies

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
some of whom want to preserve as best as possible their patent

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,320
patent royalty collection vehicles on standards that they have created and

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,840
others arguing that that's fine but you can't

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,800
do that around the open source again this is there's a debate that's been

00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,740
