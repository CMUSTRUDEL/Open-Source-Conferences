	Patents: What We've Done So Far, and What More May Need to be Done

The presentation will discuss the long history in the open source community of concerns with patents, how various steps to address those concerns provided some measure of protection, and will point out gaps that still remain and some proposals on how to fill those gaps. The presenter is a long-time commentor on legal questions in open source, and a registered U.S. patent attorney for over 30 years.
