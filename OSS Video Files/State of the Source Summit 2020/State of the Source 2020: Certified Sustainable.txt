Title: State of the Source 2020: Certified Sustainable
Publication date: 2020-09-21
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	Certified Sustainable
Jacob Redding

OpenSSLâ€™s Heartbleed was a wake up call to the sustainability of open source. In response the Critical Infrastructure Initiative (CCI) was created to help assess and address the sustainability of an open source project, but this focused on the production side. For true sustainability we must also focus on the procurement side. Those procuring software require a method to assess the sustainability initiatives of a software development agency. In this session I will propose one.

hi my name is jacob redding i'm here today

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,960
to talk to you about sustainable open source my career in

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
technology is pretty wide-ranging i've been a

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
network and assist administrator i've been a technical architect and i

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,960
have and i still do run software development teams i've

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
contributed to a number of open source projects over the years

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,519
early on it was a project called jetbox which is an open source cms

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,280
gallery which should image slide shows with php

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
i've contributed to javascript packages but i spent most of my time within the

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
drupal open source project

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
working with a great group of individuals i was one of our founding

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,719
board members and the first executive director of the

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,399
drupal association which was our non-profit that we started to help

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,079
sustain the drupal project and through sustain we mean funding the

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,680
infrastructure that runs drupal.org and the code repositories the disaster

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
recovery systems as well as running our

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,720
physical infrastructure we also ran our human infrastructure

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,960
helping to support meetups and events conferences etc

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
whatever we could do to help grow the project and sustain it and grow it from

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,159
a handful of developers to now we have well over 30 000 active

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
developers contributing every single year

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,479
and through that experience i've noticed that we do have problems within open

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,600
source and one of our most notable problems

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,520
that a lot of people are using open source

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
but not everyone is participating or contributing to the sustainability of

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
open source and this is a problem because open

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,159
source must be nurtured open source and all software is

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
not static it is a living being

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
when you release code out there you don't just leave it

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
alone it has to be updated for the latest operating system

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,480
language or framework upgrade you should be responding to feature

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,879
requests or functionality enhancements bug reports and security issues

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,720
so open source like all software has to be nurtured now in the open

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,519
source community we did learn the hard way

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
of what happens if you're not nurturing it or don't have a big enough community

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
openssl in 2014 had one of its largest exploits

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,720
there was a vulnerability in it that exposed a buffer overread

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,319
that stemmed from an unchecked input variable

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,400
and at this point a lot of very large companies were using the software

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
yahoo stack overflow amazon web services bitbucket

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,640
akamy soundcloud tumblr and more were all using it

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
these are multi-billion dollar companies that were

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
encrypting millions of dollars in transactions

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,040
every single day and it slipped by all of them despite the code being

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,640
open and transparent for all to see and i don't think the problem was that

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,239
there was a bug in the software i think all software has bugs

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
it's how we respond to that which is the important piece

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
and then in this case i think the problem was that openssl

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
had only two thousand dollars that year in donations

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,319
to be used for the maintenance and nurturing of the software and that's

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
just not enough money and yes there were some side things that

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
they were doing yes they had chargeable work and support

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
contracts but there were not enough of these

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
large companies looking at the full stack to understand everything they were using

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
 

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,000
Dries, the founder of drupal, has written a great blog post about this

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
called makers and takers and in this presentation i'm going to use some of

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,480
those concepts so i encourage you to search for this blog post

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,199
that Dries has written and makers in this case are those that are

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
creating the software writing the documentation

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,040
participating in the marketing and doing anything they can to make sure

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,520
that that project is sustainable and growing

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
and the takers are on the other side they're simply using

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,360
that's all they're doing and i think in the case of openssl

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
at this time that imbalance was highlighted

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,639
there were many takers than there were makers way too many

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,240
on the take side i see this as a stage of contribution

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
i think anybody who gets involved or starts using open source

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,639
goes through a progression they first become aware of a project and they start

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
to use it and they might learn where the community

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,759
gathers then they participate by submitting questions in they could

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,280
be in the forums or they're submitting requests for a new feature or

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,600
enhancement or maybe even a bug request then hopefully they jump to the other

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,759
side and they start contributing instead of just submitting a bug report

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,320
they contribute the code to fix that bug or they write some documentation or they

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
assist others in the forum or they financially contribute and then

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
they progress further and they become engaged

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,280
they submit major changes they become they take on a leadership role

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,400
they assist in the documentation the marketing etc

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,160
they get engaged in that project and this could be an individual

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:55,039
or it could be a team at a company either i think it's the same progression

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,639
and i think right now our balancing act between those that are

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,400
aware and slightly participating and those that are contributing and engage

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,560
is off the makers and takers is not balanced there are too many people just

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
using and submitting in then there are

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:21,680
contributing or being engaged

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
i think we have another problem that is growing and we're going to see it grow

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
over the years and it's with package managers

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,400
package managers are great and they're wonderful and they allow us to easily create new

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,039
software npm pip ruby on rails they've created

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,759
these wonderful infrastructures allow us to

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
quickly just grab a bunch of code put it in and like just get to the point

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,039
it's wonderful but i think that the ubiquity of these package managers

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,400
is leading us to some obscurity of where the software is coming from

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
because in one line within a python script i could just

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,160
add in a library that is i don't know a thousand or ten thousand or a hundred or

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960
a hundred thousand lines of code i might not know and i might not also

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,880
know how many people is it taking to maintain that library

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,280
if i write a python script and i include scikit is that one person or a hundred people

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
who is testing that software

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,960
who's testing that library right so this ubiquity of these package managers

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
is leading us to obscure where all of this code comes

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
from now the background on my slide is also

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
something that's more a little bit more non-software in real world it's toilet

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
paper toilet paper last year was ubiquitous it was

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,520
absolutely everywhere hotels restaurants the store etc

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,400
and it took a pandemic and all the toilet paper went away

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
for us to realize that we had a supply chain problem

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
where it was highly dependent upon the demand

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,319
and we didn't really understand where everything is and all the toilet paper

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
all of a sudden went went away and i think with software we

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,080
kind of have the same thing right now we rely upon these packet managers and

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,879
it's just sort of magic and it's there but one day it might not be if we're not

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
paying attention to the sustainability of this

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
now i want to recognize that we've made a lot of strides in this area

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
the linux foundation formed the core infrastructure initiative

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,680
github introduced contribution stars and open collective and tide lift were

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,039
created to add direct funding to open source projects

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,480
by reviewing the entire stack these initiatives are working and there

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,120
are moving us forward but they're not enough open source is

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
growing rapidly and extending into more industries in more areas

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,800
so we're going to need to change the culture and structure of every industry

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,760
so i'm looking to other industries

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,920
for example how do they sustain their industry and the fishing industry

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,080
here is one of the biggest industries there

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,560
that needs sustainability there's only so many bodies of water and

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,440
there's only so many fish in the sea and

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,200
we have to collaborate on a global scale with all the fisheries in every country

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,160
and every boat owner to create sustainability within the

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
fishing industry otherwise as technology advances we will

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
literally take all the fish out of the ocean we

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,000
recognized that decades ago and created initiatives

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,560
to make that industry more sustainable and i'm not saying they're perfect

00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,560
nothing is but they're doing a better job every single year

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,480
and there's a number of other bodies that we can look to

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
so within fishing it's the marine stewardship

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,480
council or msc there's a certification the rainforest alliance the fair trade

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,720
group there's brands like tony's chocaloni

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,399
which looks at their entire uh supply chain so they know

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,680
not just where they get their their cocoa powder

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
or their cocoa butter but where those uh cocoa pods come from and where

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
the farmers are and where they have planted their seeds so they know that

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,279
the entire supply chain from farmer to bar

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,120
is sustainable and that the money is going to the right place

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,040
similar with rainforest alliance and fair trade and uh etc

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,200
their focus on the sustainability of the full supply chain

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,399
and i believe in the open source world we need to do something similar so if we

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,040
look at the vision and mission of msc

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,959
their vision is they want to see the world's ocean teeming with life

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,120
and that sisu supplies are safeguarded for future generations

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,800
and they do that through the eco label and fishery certification

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,040
so i want to do something similar i want to create the sustainable open source

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,079
certification or sos it's certified put a stamp on it we're

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,079
going to create sustainable open source

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
the vision and mission statement of this program

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
would be to create a vibrant software ecosystem that

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,399
pushes the boundaries of an innovation while maintaining full stack

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
sustainability reliability and safeguarding this for future generations

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
and we're going to do it in a similar way we'll create an sos label

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,399
and a certification program and the goal would be to influence the

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
choices that companies make when hiring development

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,120
agencies and working with our partners to transform the software industry

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,079
because we need balance in this world we need a balance between those that

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,440
make the software and those that take the software

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
so we need to focus on those that are taking the software

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,800
so that they work with those that make the software

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,279
that creates our balance in other certification programs they do that by

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,000
focusing on the consumers not the creators but the consumers and

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
open collective and tie lift are doing that

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,040
i think we need to do that to a much grander scale

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,000
so who would lead this i think the open source initiative

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,279
should lead this or and or b corporations

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,079
should lead this the be corporation certification program

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
could add in open source sustainability as

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
part of its program so that you can become a b

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,200
corp if you're also helping to sustain open source

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,240
and this is partially already being done etsy is a b corp hootsuite is a b corp

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,399
warby parker is a b corp and each of these have

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,760
really great technology teams that do participate

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,480
in open source and that has led to them becoming a certified b corp

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,519
and b corps are not for smaller companies not saying that etsy or

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
hootsuite is a small company they're pretty big

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,320
but dannon is a gargantuan companies one of the largest companies in the world

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,199
and they're also a certified b corp so we can target small and very

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,519
large organizations through the b corp program

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
if we can convince them that open source sustainability

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,040
and backing your stack is something that they need to incorporate in the b corp

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
or they should work with the open source initiative

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
and marry these two so that you get osi certified

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,720
as part of your b corp program

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,760
so how do we do this i think whoever leads this needs to do targeted

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,199
marketing to educate and inform consumers

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,440
not makers the takers of open source software

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
that they need to work with certified sustainable open source software

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,480
companies i want to see within rfps that the rfp

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,199
requests a certification status that preference is given to certified

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
agencies that those who are paying for software

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,480
to be built or who are building software development teams

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,639
or who are creating budgets and they're forward-looking in their budgets

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,519
that they should be looking at how the

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,959
sustainability of their software is created and the way it could be created

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
is by looking at a certification

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
is their team certified as sustainable is the agency

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,240
they're working with certified as being a sustainable

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,399
organization similar to how we look at a chocolate bar for us fair trade or

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,480
buyer coffee from fair trade or when we go to a

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,040
a restaurant we get msc certified fish we need to do this in a similar way

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,720
we need to knock out the players in the market that are

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,240
not focused on sustainability if they're just using software and

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,639
reselling it we need to knock them out by getting

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,959
them into a certification program which means getting them into sustainable

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,480
practices so who gets certified all right this is

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
where it's going to get messy the devil's in the details in fact the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,720
devil's right here on the slide you can see him but we've built bigger

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,320
things in open source and i'm confident we can get through this one so my first

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,440
target would be any members of open collective and

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,800
tidelift they're most likely solid contributors

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,519
open source and they care about the sustainability

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,759
of the software they're using so they would be easy targets to be certified

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
i also think we should collaborate with gitlab github and others

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:29,759
as well as packet managers to traverse who's using the software

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,880
and if they're contributing back to it the data is there

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,199
it's not easy it's not perfect but we can do some correlations it's one

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,800
of many metrics we can use if your company is downloading a lot for

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
github or has put it as part of a dependency

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,279
package and you can see it on a consistent basis during your build

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,600
processes that you're pulling from an open source

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
project but that company is never participating in it and that

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,079
happens over and over again that's an audit trail that could be used

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,120
as one of many metrics to say you either are part of the

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,160
sustainability of open source or you are not

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,720
i think we also need to learn from b corps where there's a self-assessment

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,000
that is up for review by the organization

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,559
and then there's audit rights so the company is given a checklist of what

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,799
makes you sustainable they do a self-assessment

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,000
and they submit that up for a review this could be where the open source

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,440
initiative steps in and does that review and upon that review of the company's

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,559
self-assessment they issue a certification or a

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,720
non-certification but they reserve the right to do an actual audit

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,679
and that audit could be of github contributions or git lab or

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
do they have a tied list subscription or open collective subscription

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,880
are they financially contributing are they involved in the marketing the

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,960
decision making the leadership etc i think we can do this and we have

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,960
precedent out there in other industries i would like us to

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,240
bring it into this industry into open source

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,840
and with that i thank you for your time and if you have any questions i'll be

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
right here i want to take the burden off the makers

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,360
and to and put it on the takers

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,559
um so the question was the sellers of software

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,559
sas providers and integrators yep yep anybody who's like building software

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,960
to be sold in some form um and then you know they're they have

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
an audience of either individuals or companies

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,559
and those companies and individuals um are the ones that would be requesting it

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,880
like i only want to work with sustainable software developers you know

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
i want to work with developers that are really focused at and this is starting

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
to happen like

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,799
mike lam over at pfizer he's got some presentations online that you can google

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,640
and he he puts that in his rfps so when he's hiring

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
uh companies he's like tell me your open source um

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,000
strategy um i work for accenture and i've

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,160
received those rfps from certain companies where in the rfp it's like

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
you know tell us how many people you have how many certified your skill

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
levels and one of them is tell us about your

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
open source contributions and so being the open source guy at

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
accenture of many people there's a decent sized team here

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
we're constantly looking at and pulling that evidence and showing what we're

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,880
doing and it's pushed this company to to

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,039
change i just want to do that on a very large scale one's being typed out

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,520
here the sustain oss we did bring this up at sustain oss um

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,760
we were in belgium i think i was i was there

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,679
before the pandemic has changed time and space for me

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,360
um so uh it was brought up but not to this level i don't think so the third

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,720
question is have i thought about what the certifications would look like

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:18,159
um to some extent not every detail it's gonna be messy but i largely look

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,240
to b corps and and and a little bit to

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,400
msc um the marine stewardship council uh and the reason i look at these two

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,480
versus like fair trade organic or others um one if we look at b corps they're

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,320
looking at the financial status and and community involvement and

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,799
engagement to create sustainability in business

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,039
practices so if you look at the b corp what they're looking at it really is

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,440
heavily focused on sustainability of business

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,760
ecosystem integrated with the community where they're at

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,039
and so there's lots of metrics on that and some of them are very

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,880
subjective very few of them are are objective

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,520
um but they're you know they're very holistic

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
the machine marine stewardship council while it's not

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,520
perfect they have to focus on a global initiative through government

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,760
regulations through government changes and not just be like hey here's a little

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,120
label you put on your fish but they're they're changing the entire

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,400
supply chain and they have to do that worldwide and it's heavily political

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
and lots of regulations and is it international honors or not et cetera et

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
cetera um so they've thought through a lot of

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
this over decades so a lot of things that we'll run

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,200
into in terms of well there are government regulations and there are

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
changes they've largely figured those out and

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,159
there's a lot we can learn from there and bring them over so when i think of

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,919
what it looks like these are the two models b corp and msc

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
i think we marry those things up and i think we

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:58,400
have something pretty close and then we refine it and find bugs and

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,840
and do what we do in open source we take an idea and then we

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,760
make it better okay so number four is a really good question

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
for to be adopted how can we create a demand for the organizations

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,480
this is the absolute critical piece uh and i think i only had like a slide

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,840
on it maybe two um but i one i'm 100 there the demand

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,520
has to come from the buyers the consumers

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
uh and that's what i'm saying is we create that demand is it's a heavy

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
marketing campaign you want to go out and you want to

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,760
convince people that if they're hiring a software development agency or creative

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,400
agency and they're not asking them for their

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,919
open source sustainability then they're they they're making a risky

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,280
financial decision and that's going to take marketing um

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
you know if you look at how amazon or microsoft or others

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,960
do their their their marketing for why do you hire a certified microsoft

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,400
developer or why do you hire a certified you know amazon architect

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,520
i mean that's that's that's straight that's basically it it's

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,720
if you don't do this you're taking a financial risk because you don't know

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
the person on the other end and we need to do the same thing so i

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
look at the osi that way and think maybe this is where

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,039
osi shifts some focus and goes straight after consumers

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,440
and says and convinces them to only hire those that are being part of the open

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,039
source cycle and if they don't then that's a risk

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,760
that they shouldn't be taking but it's it's just sort of like uh

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,120
i i think it's just pure marketing to be to be honest

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,280
that's about big blue button

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
i thought it was like confusing i was like oh the whole thing's confusing you

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
know this i think we can still do it though it's

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,159
get building the certification will be confusing it's not going to be

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,480
perfect report and i also to be very honest for the people in the room

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
and the recording i mean this is going to take the better part of a decade

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
it's it's not going to this is nothing we're going to create tomorrow and

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,840
and push out there you know microsoft's been doing their certification program

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,960
for 30 40 years but i mean at this point

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,640
you know they've convinced their market that no you hire certified

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,760
you know you hire in their partner ecosystem you hire

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,440
microsoft certified people amazon's doing it google's doing it

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,960
like it's a it's a not an uncommon thing and msc

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,159
has been doing it for decades like this is a long term

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,679
view that has to be you know started and then there's a big sort of

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,600
pressure campaign that lasts years rich in regards to the slide i'm

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,880
happy to put them but i think the state of the source conference has a

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
whole program of posting these and putting them so

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,679
um if you have shared them with us uh we'll

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,320
attach them to the session listing on eventyay if you haven't send them to us

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,480
uh and we'll get those linked up there and then post event there will be

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
um you know recordings of all of this with

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,000
slides and stuff again so if you wanted to watch there

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
notice above that josh says that this sounds like a great initiative to

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,760
explore through an osi working agency i mean i'm happy to chat anybody's ear

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,400
off about this i talk about this a lot right now

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,760
volunteers in the chat so make sure you check and see who those

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,559
those individuals are yeah i mean i think it's a like a working group but i

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,760
do think it's a it's a concerted effort that would take years

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
getting b corp off the ground took many many many years

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,000
and um i think the last like blog post i read about it which is

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
a few years ago it was somewhere between 10 and 15

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,120
million dollars just to really get traction um in staff and in

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
marketing and in convincing people and helping people

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,480
to understand why should i care and again you're not focusing on the

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
developers it's 100 on the people that are writing the rfps

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,600
and you get into those companies and say this is

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,200
why you care you know it's your in your financial

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
interest um but that's a that's a lot of work

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,679
like think of how long it took us to convince is that

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,600
organic was a good thing uh you know or fair trade was a good thing uh and

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
we're still doing those efforts i mean one of the reasons i don't look

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
at the fair trade not that i don't think it's a good thing i think fair trade is

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,559
a great thing but if you actually dig into fair trade

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,240
there's many different certifications for fair trade it's not just

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,720
one fair trade this rainforest is doing it uh there's a usda sort of

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,799
one on it there's a different one individual companies do it manufacturers

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,039
have their own fair trade status certification

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,640
like it's still being worked out and they've been doing it for 20 years and

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,120
lot of work over many many many years um and you got to get a lot

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,760
