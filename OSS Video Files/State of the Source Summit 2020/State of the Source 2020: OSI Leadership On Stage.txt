patrick was osi's first full-time staff member hired

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,360
in 2013 uh he spent many many months and untold

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,800
hours getting the project i mean on osi but

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,360
also getting state of the source running by the time patrick left

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,440
us in july this thing was on rails there was no way

00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
of stopping it um and so i'm so grateful uh patrick for

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,759
service in general we'll talk more about that later

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
but specifically for getting state of the source running

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
and then i want to thank deb nicholson our new general manager

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
uh who started uh her first day at the end of august and the beginning of

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
september and uh suffice it to say you could tell we've

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,880
thrown her right into the deep end she's here presenting with us in the panel

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,879
and we couldn't be happier to have deb with us uh so thank you deb for jumping

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,400
right in and being here with us uh gratitude's gonna be a theme for this

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
intro i also want to thank the speakers and

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,640
attendees honestly uh no events an event you know like if

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
there's no speakers and attendees the event doesn't happen

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
uh so i want to really uh express my gratitude to everybody who submitted

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
proposals to the call for proposals uh a lot of tough choices were made

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,680
there i want to thank the uh the speakers who got through

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
and put in the time and energy to create their presentations and be here with us

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
to answer questions from attendees and i

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,879
want to thank the attendees because of course you know

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,160
speaking to an empty room but that's no good for anybody

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,760
um this event has you know for a first year event has just

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
blown beyond any expectations i had and really

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
it's all thanks to the speakers and attendees who are making this

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,519
who are bringing the important conversations here and really engaging

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,760
in good faith so i want to talk a little bit just to

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
set some scenery set the scene a little bit

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
uh about where osi is at right now and and what

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,260
what i'm excited about in the coming year and then i'll hand it off

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,600
uh we'll all do some intros you know this year osi is working through

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,920
uh a transformation the second major transformation since it was founded in

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
1998. this trans transformation you know maybe

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,800
2020 is the year where it's really culminating

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,560
but this has been years in the making um while the results of the transformation

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,440
we're going through will be an osi with radically improved

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,599
capabilities the process itself is not all that

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,159
radical uh this is a natural part of the

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,680
non-profit sort of organizational development life cycle

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
you know we started as a band of self-selected volunteers

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
who stood up an organization because they knew that something was needed

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,920
in 2013 the board introduced community elections to make sure that there was

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,000
better representation and help give osi that that that regular

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
projection of fresh perspective to make sure that the organization would

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
evolve with the community the other key thing that they did in

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
2013 we hired patrick our first full-time staff member and at

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
that point osi transitioned from being volunteer

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
operated to being staff operated but while patrick was at the helm really

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,240
you know in the driver's seat the board and all the volunteers we were

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,639
still backseat driving and we we still are so osi right now

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,240
is a staff operated organization but volunteer driven

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
and volunteer supported now the trans the transformation we're going through

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
now is to a model where we're going to be

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,440
staff driven and staff operated while the volunteers

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
work on supervision and guidance basically

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
we don't want to rely so much on volunteer labor labor for core

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
operations it's just not sustainable especially not

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
in an age when osi needs to really rise to the occasion of

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
all the challenges that there are in open source

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
anyhow we're not resting on our laurels as we do this self-work

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
as an org with stakeholders in over 55 countries with 125

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,960
organizational allies representing hundreds of thousands of people

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,680
we don't get to hit pause we've got the floss desktops for kids program that's

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
been operational uh something that's especially near and

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,720
dear to my heart in the wake of the the resurgence of the

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
black lives matter movement because the floss desktops for kids

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
program not only does it put floss free and open source software in

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
the hands of kids you know middle schoolers in below i

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
think some high schools as well not only does it put freedoms or

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
software in their hands it gives them a computer that they can

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,759
take home you know and they they go through the experience of building that

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,800
computer so there's ownership with it and that program over 50 of the

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,759
beneficiaries of that program are our black indigenous people of color

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,000
uh uh students and and kids and so that's really meaningful

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,039
um we also have the open source technology management program with

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
brandeis university that's an educational program we've been

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,600
rolling out in partnership with them pam here has been really busy with

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
license review process reform uh we've invested a lot in moderation

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,080
over the last year the standards uh the standards business

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,400
has been very uh keeping us on our toes um i i won't

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
speak to that but there's a lot going on in that space as well

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
uh we've had atlanta here and and people on the board who are really invested in

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,319
membership doing quarterly affiliate calls that italia started

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
a year or two ago and those have really proved a great resource to make sure

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,479
that the community's coming together and

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,280
we're comparing notes and supporting each other

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,880
don't worry i'm about to wrap up lastly we have this

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,360
event too i cannot overstate how important state of the source is for us

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,599
this may be just the first event but i think i would say that this is

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,199
uh really a demarcation line for us you know osi has been i think rightly

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
criticized for not being a leading voice in many of the conversations that are

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
happening around open source this this is the beginning of us

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
changing that ship uh of steering that ship in a different

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
direction we want to be a leading voice and we don't want to be the one speaking

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,599
on your behalf all the time we want you to be here we want to bring your voice

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,880
to the table and provide you a platform as well so

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
this is really an important event and it's taken a lot of energy to get this

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
over the line so i'm very grateful for all that none

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,039
of this would be possible but for my peers here on the board uh

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
nor without our staff both past and present

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,120
um again i really want to thank patrick gear

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,720
who is our former general manager but still has a professional relationship

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
with us transitioning the organization to a point where we will eventually hire

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,479
someone like an executive director patrick put in seven years

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,759
and let's just say he didn't have 40 hour work

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,800
weeks he had startup hours um and he made a lot of sacrifices

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,039
and just you know nothing that we're doing that would be possible buffer

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,599
patrick we are we are endlessly grateful for him

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,120
uh he will go down in the history books with us um

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
and then you know patrick resigned in in july

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
uh and just this month we have deb nicholson our new internal general

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,360
manager starting with us and uh we just you know we we

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,519
we couldn't be happier about that and we are so fortunate to have both of these

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,040
these people who served as staff past and present

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
um i think the whole community owes them the debt of gratitude

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
nobody will ever really understand the full scope of how busy they are and how

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,760
much work we put on their shoulders um so in closing thank you all for being

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,880
here uh i will toss it to uh hong phuc

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,000

awesome um do folks from the audience have questions because this is a little

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
bit of an AMA if um where you get to ask whatever

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,000
you're wondering about the osi and it's you know plans and

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,680
thoughts um not yet i uh patrick you know

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,800
this is the patrick introduced already oh um patrick did you want to introduce

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,120
yourself i wasn't sure i was going to leave it with the glorious introduction

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
that josh did but if you want to also say something that

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,240
would be great i'll uh i'm good josh did a fantastic job thanks

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,959
um how about we hear from deb nicholson on the new gm

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,040
he made me sound better than i normally do when i introduce myself too so

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
i i think what we learned is josh is really good at introductions maybe we'll

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
just have him introduce everybody next time

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,839
but i am excited to be the new gm and i'm excited to

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,160
patrick's been super great as uh helping on the transition so um and we

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,040
have a question from the audience uh so uh what are the osi's plans

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
to address the outreach challenge i talked about yesterday on my

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
uh lightning talk jomar do you want to um say

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
uh i'm not sure if every single person on today's panel

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
was at yesterday's lightning talk do you want to say uh

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
one or two things about

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,200
your um what you were what you would like us to speak to on there

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,880
okay oh so many people are typing let's go ahead and take the second question

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
and then we'll come back on that one um what's it look like to grow from a

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,360
volunteer organization to a non-profit that is self-sustaining

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
who would like to speak to that

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,440
i'll go ahead and jump in oh i see megan's mic is working and i think maybe

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,199
uh she might also be a good person to speak to this point

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,800
sure and just to repeat the question was what is it like to

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,320
kind of evolve your non-profit

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,480
or um i guess more specifically like to grow from a volunteer organization to a

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,839
non-profit that is self-sustaining yes well it's it's you know certainly

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
complex because you want to keep the spirit of volunteerism

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,959
but you also want to create a board where they're kind of

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,959
focusing more on this kind of advisory strategic and direction

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,120
and then there's also staff that can then help with the

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,079
strategy and turn it into the operational plans

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,760
and um it requires uh the board making a shift like a very

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
intentional shift and really coming up with that that

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,519
strategic direction where they want to go

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,839
and redefining that relationship between the board and staff

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,800
um and what kind of uh staff do you need to start building out to take over some

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
of that volunteer work and of course you want to think about

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,760
where there can still be volunteerism so it's not just all on staff as well

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,639
and then as you think about the staffing and the programs that you're going to do

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
to really step into the mission of your nonprofit

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
you of course need funding to support all of that so as part of that plan you

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
need to think about what does sustainable funding look like to

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,959
support this step this growing staff and the programs that you need to do

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,199
and so it's a very multifaceted intentional process

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,920
um to make that shift and um hopefully that kind of gives a little

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,440
insight into some of the things we're working on these days cool

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
um the other question the rest of the other question

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,199
was what are the osi's plans to address the outreach challenges

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,120
with regards to people who use open source but don't really understand what

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
it is

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:13,440
i can call on folks or you are so polite who would like to take that one on

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,120
okay i can take it okay okay i think uh there are many

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,759
many issues about this topic

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,880
the users are attracted by open source in many cases

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,839
because it's free free as in beer not free as in

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,759
freedom unfortunately but

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,800
and so they they in many cases they see it

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,120
as a low cost replacement of a proprietary product

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,440
and when they approach open source this way is

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,319
then is very difficult to bring them to the to the right side uh

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,160
either they are very curious uh actually i

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,919
started in open source uh 18 years ago exactly because it was free as in beer

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,600
but then i was amazed by the community and i

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,360
try to understand the community but not everyone

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,160
has this same attitude i think we have a huge responsibility in

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,360
communicating better what open source is

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,160
we should be more united or

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,200
that we we should be a huge community communicating open source in many cases

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,720
we lose a lot of time by discussing between

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,760
different communities i've seen conferences where

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
different linux distros were discussing about their merits

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,600
or their demerits in some cases instead of

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
convincing the users about moving to any one

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
of the linux distros instead of using windows or

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,919
macintosh i think we have as osi we have a huge responsibility in

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,200
leading this kind of

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,640
proactive and educational communication to the users it's not easy uh users are

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,559
so many and are so scattered around that

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,320
reaching them all it's practically impossible but everyone

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,919
who's supporting open source should back osi and not only osi of course

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:53,520
in promoting open source horizontally not just my open source product or my

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,120
open source technology but open source in general

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,200
and then once the users has been educated then

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
they will make their choice and i think we should be happy about any

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,640
choice which is really open source i'm of course i'm one of the

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
founders of the libreoffice project so of course

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,559
if everyone would use libreoffice i would be

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,240
the most happy person in the world but i know that this is impossible so

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,080
i would like them to use an open source productivity software then

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
if it's libreoffice i'm happy if it's not libreoffice i'm happy as

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,679
well they should learn about open standards

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
we oh we have a question about standards

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,679
coming so so that is my take on the topic

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,360
so yeah solidarity and better communication with the community and

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,400
education that's that's awesome there is

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,679
another question about standards if we want to just jump off from the end there

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,600
so this person says josh mentioned interesting times with standards

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
activities obviously this is interesting to us standards people too

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,720
does the board or some of the active stakeholders have

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,840
plans for the osr

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,559
i don't know if josh you want to start there since um you you sort of dropped

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,200
the interesting standards in i mean interesting times on the

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,039
standards activity can i just ask for a clarification on

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,200
what osr stands for oh yeah what does osr stand for that's

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,919
jamie from oasis oh there we go oh hi jamie oh does that

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,080
answer what who then

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,039
no what is osr i'm sorry oh yeah okay i said know this but

00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:03,679
um there's a lot of o's and like oh acronyms in our space i think um

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,520
ah okay thank you alana so the open standards requirement

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,640
being uh on maybe i shouldn't be answering this question then i

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
was hoping i could answer the question but i think i maybe don't understand the

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,280
question i don't know deb if if you have if

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
you're understanding the question better than i am

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,840
uh i don't think so the other day oh the other deb might yes sorry

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,320
oh that is gonna see it'd be better if one of us was tall

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,240
so so just a clarifying question so are you asking a question about how we

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,200
relate to the implementation i'm not sure what

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
the use case is so i think they want to know if we have

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,640
plans for the open standards requirement

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,000
to to incorporate it into so so we so osi is traditionally focused on

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,360
the osd we've talked about other things like

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,080
open data standards and such in the past but really our main charter is open

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,480
source software and open source licensing

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,320
there's a tremendously important relationship between

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,520
open source software and open standards in fact you really can't have open

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,880
source software without open standards but we don't currently have any plans to

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,520
incorporate that into our own standard if that makes sense that's a

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,960
companion standard and an initiative so to speak

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,919
that that's complementary but i if i understand the question we don't have

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
any plans to to write it into part of our charter that makes sense i think

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
that's well covered by organizations like oasis

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,760
and other standards organization we do have an increasingly active

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
standards organization we're doing quite a bit today in in europe

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,360
you're going to probably see more outreach uh pam

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,200
is the chair of our standards commission committee which is why she was brave

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
enough to ask the clarifying question because we all want to make sure we

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,200
understand what's being asked uh and i and we're looking forward to

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
that we think that's both an opportunity for education

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
it's also turning into a bit of a battlefield

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,200
so to speak i i use that term in terms of

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,799
conflict of concepts between proprietary

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,520
vendors and the standards are creating in areas like

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,000
telecommunications for instance and etsy in europe

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,039
and so it's really it's an important place for

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
open source to be able to influence to make sure

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,000
we don't accidentally have open source redefined in the industry

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
and also continue to educate so i hope that's helpful

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,039
to addressing the question so someone i'm assuming jamie threw a link

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,679
in the notes which is osi's

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,880
the os has our own webpage on open standards requirements which

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,919
i frankly had never seen before it looks like it's from 2000 this 2006 page

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,720
so uh one sort of one of the interesting aspects of uh historic websites

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,120
so just to sort of defy the statement if we're not

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,679
interested in open standards requirement i will point out we have a page about it

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,159
but i think as what deb did a good job of summarizing what joshua was

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,919
alluding to in his opening remarks is where we're currently spending a lot of

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,360
energy and effort is ensuring that um standard setting bodies

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,240
are not trying to basically play with the definition of open source

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,080
in a way that's going to be harmful to the open source definition or

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,200
the open source ecosystem as a whole or the development of open source

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
software so there's a lot there's some tension there and

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,279
we're working to try to make sure that nothing untoward happens

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,480
great i think this one hopefully won't need too much clarification

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
we have a question from justin fleury about

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,039
affiliate membership has three different options non-profit

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,159
education and user community is the room for organizations that do not fit these

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,120
organizational archetypes and he says eg NGOs and UN agencies

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,400
so i think i guess we know where that question is coming from

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,159
yeah i can maybe take that one as a membership chair

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,440
and currently processing affiliate memberships and

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,799
certainly recruiting a lot of affiliates so

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,960
i mean as far as we're concerned you know i would say like NGOs

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,559
would tend to fit under sort of the non-profit banner now

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,000
they're not necessarily they might not necessarily have like

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,799
the government recognized non-profit status in the like

00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:46,960
501cc or three or 501c6 sense but that's not necessarily an issue

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,360
like those categories are mostly more in terms of like

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,559
basic checklists for certain archetypes of organizations as opposed to

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,520
our affiliate program is only aimed at like these three types of organizations

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,960
and if you're not one of those but you're vaguely like a non-profit in

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,760
some sense we don't want you no we certainly want you

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,440
and you know if the checklist does not fit the organization

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
reach out with the affiliate contact form and we can certainly work with

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
you to make sure like are you you know compatible with

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,440
the spirit of these requirements and if so like how do we get you on

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
board certainly one of the things that i've been working on

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,720
is expanding the affiliate membership and there's actually uh deb in the

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,880
questions question six is maybe a good segue

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,279
for this one do you want me to jump into

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,240
talking about that one too sure question six says based on our

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,360
previous talk has the osi thought of how to

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,480
leverage your strength with open source allies to find out what

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,880
are the issues that projects are having challenges engaging and onboarding new

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,799
users so as to find a lowest common denominator and help keep those projects

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,360
thriving yes so one of the things that i did

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
recently was i ran a member survey so specifically

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,559
targeted at our stakeholders who are either affiliate or individual members

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,080
and asking for a bunch of feedback on a bunch of different things

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,039
in terms of like long-form questions and one of the questions i asked is

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,840
you know what do you think like the osi secret sauce is what do you

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,799
think the osi is uniquely positioned to address that

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
maybe other organizations are not and one of the things that we heard from

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,279
that particular portion of our membership was the osi is

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,559
in this unique position where it kind of represents a broad

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,039
coalition of interests and therefore could potentially serve

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,760
as sort of a staging ground for a lot of

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,000
these conversations that we need to be having

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,360
so certainly like i think state of the source conference

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,320
is potentially a great example of one of the ways that the osi can help

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,720
lead and foster those conversations another thing that we are currently

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,799
doing specifically through the affiliate membership program

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,919
which is sort of designed to bring together like

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,080
user groups and foundations and other organizations

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,200
like that italo took a gap year from the board but one of the things he

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,640
did before his departure was he ran one quarterly affiliate call which

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,440
then i have taken over and says since then i've run a number of quarterly

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
affiliate calls where we bring all the affiliates together

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,919
giving them an opportunity to cross-pollinate

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,360
and discuss you know sort of recent topics of interest so we've

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,919
certainly discussed events in the era of the global pandemic

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,360
and open source sustainability and you know

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,039
like putting out rfps in order to find staff or

00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,399
volunteers like we've covered many many subjects and i'm hoping that

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,399
that is going to continue to be a forum for this in the future and we

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,760
continue to increase our engagement with these

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,880
sorts of organizations but hopefully that answers your

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,600
question awesome i'm jumping around a little

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,760
bit because some of these are i want to make sure that we get like

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,320
as much breadth as possible so i'm going to

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,440
go to the eighth one on there and then we'll loop back around someone

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,840
says i am worried that the shift towards a self-centered organization will result

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,080
in osi becoming even more dominated by corporates with

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,440
financial resources rather than independent developers and community

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
contributors most of the board members seem to be

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,039
representatives from american corporations which are not always

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,880
completely dedicated to open source how can we ensure more diverse and

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,039
international community representation on the

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,559
i'll board take that one and i'm really glad that somebody asked the

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,520
question because that's you know that's that's an important

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,279
subtext to be sensitive to and aware of first i just want to share a little

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,159
bit about my my my background you know i got into

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
open source through being a a web developer a

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,200
freelancer in fact and i was a freelancer using and

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,440
benefiting from open source for for well over a decade before

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
i entered shall we say corporate america and so

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
i can never forget what it was like to

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,240
be a hobbyist and an independent

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,760
contractor who really relied on open source so i have

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,200
that perspective in the back of my head at all times also just philosophically

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
i'm very taken by the software freedom movement

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
and so that's always a perspective as well

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,960
you know when i first ran for the board in 2016 i just want to

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
share one line you know in my platform said

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,399
there's a vision for open source and it emphatically emphasizes the role of the

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,080
individual open source committer in the face of corporate funded foundations

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,200
that sometimes distort the true spirit of open source

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,840
now maybe that is a little bit provocative but you know that's

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,399
what election platforms are for but that's still true today you know the

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,200
thing that osi really does that is more important than

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
that is so essential to fulfilling its mission

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,000
is being a convener of different stakeholders and being a convener

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,840
of stakeholders that can level a playing field as best possible

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,960
so that nobody is disadvantaged in these discussions

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,399
and so that means bringing together you know

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,519
people from from the software freedom communities

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,519
people from corporate open source hobbyists who are involved in open

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,399
source humanitarian and sort of

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
non-profit foundations in their use of open source

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
you know all of these are really essential stakeholders for us to have at

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,080
the table and this is why

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
you know again there's a lot that is u.s. specific and i think we're very

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,919
self-aware of that and over the last four years

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,760
we've made intentional efforts to build out representation more or

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,720
internationally and if you look at the the affiliate

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
members that we've been recruiting you'll see that reflected

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,120
you know it's not just talk we're walking that walk

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
and so not only are we making intentional efforts to improve

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,279
representation globally but we are also looking to deploy

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,720
sort of new vehicles that will provide official forums for

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,919
the community to come together and have these discussions

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,440
so for instance many people are familiar with our license review and license

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,000
discuss lists but suffice it to say not every

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,799
discussion belongs there there are other really valid and

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,440
important conversation to be having about open source that don't

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,799
neatly fit into licensing and we would like to provide a forum for those

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,960
discussions so some of the things that we're

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,039
thinking about not only are we going to be

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
hiring more staff and specifically looking at hiring someone like an

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,480
executive director in the in the future we're also looking at hiring a community

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
manager and a communications manager to help us support a community

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,200
engagement infrastructure that will help make sure that we

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,440
systematically listen to everyone everyone

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
and that we are not giving undue influence to

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,039
to corporate sponsors and i think one thing that's really important

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,679
to mention you know not only are we going to be

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
we're making investments to make sure that

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:34,240
we can in a systematic way make sure that there's representation but there's something that is important about the very dna of open

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,440
source initiative osi is a 501c3 nonprofit in the u.s.

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,519
now that may be just a series of letters and numbers to some folks

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,840
but for folks like me who unfortunately have an intimate knowledge of the us tax

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,600
code that is very meaningful you know there

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,080
are many foundations non-profits out there who are 501 c 6

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,760
organizations and the difference between c3 and c6

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,200
is not crystal clear but there's one very

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,399
bright dividing line and it's really important and i want to mention this and

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,320
i hope that it sticks with you osi as a 501c3 nonprofit

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,079
is required to act in the public interest

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,240
is not allowed to do the bidding of our corporate sponsors

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,599
yes we can treat them as a stakeholder and we can fold their feedback and their

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,800
views into into the work that

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
we do but this is not a pay to play scheme we

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,359
are legally required or legally prohibited

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,520
from being a pay-to-play scheme so just know that we're both

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,639
operationalizing things to again systematically listen to everybody

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,599
and make sure everybody has a platform and a way to be heard

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,240
but there's also a legal backstop for us there's that legal protection that

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,760
that really ties our hands in the things that we can and cannot do

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,960
so you know i can make all the i can say all these things i can assure you

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,640
that there's that legal backstop but i also want to say like please keep

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,720
asking that question never stop asking that question because

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,839
i won't always be on the board and these people won't always be on the

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,280
board and so the makeup of this organization will change over time

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
and so we need you to continue holding us to account

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,160
as much as we are also working to hold ourselves to account

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,480
so keep grilling us and thank you for the tough question

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,880
so it's safe to say we'll have AMA again next year at state of the source

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
yeah please just i wanted to specifically address the comment

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,000
especially because i think i did a bad job introducing myself

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,880
most of the board members seem to be representatives from american

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,720
corporations which are not always completely dedicated to open source

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,960
so four of the people on this current panel are actually based in

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,160
europe i'm canadian not american not that

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,760
necessarily matters but i introduced myself as being an sre

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,520
from red hat because there is a legal requirement to do so being a publicly

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,079
owned company not because they are my primary

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,880
affiliation so just to speak a little bit to how like the osi elections work

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,880
i did not work at red hat at the time when i ran for the board i ran as an

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
individual while i was currently working at another

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,240
company and i ran on behalf of the individual membership so my job on the

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,520
board is to you know represent their interests

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,119
i'm currently the membership chair which means the majority of

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,320
my activities on the board right now at least for me

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,599
personally are dedicated to advancing the interest

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,640
of the individual and affiliate membership not

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
my employer my employer is very supportive of me

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,680
being on the board which is great but that is

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,240
certainly not my reason to be on the board it's not part of my day job

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,960
and it's not part of my goals for my term in the osi

00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,520
and i suspect a lot of other folks on the board it's very similar for them but i think probably the majority of people on this panel are not

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
necessarily in that position where they're working for an american

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,960
for-profit company well in particular well faidon actually

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,079
pinged me on back too and he does work at a

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,119
non-profit so maybe he'd like to speak to that too

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,359
i'll get you next time so i think what what that

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,040
elana is saying it was just just saying as well for for the

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,560
for the c3 report is that the board of the osi doesn't have representatives

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:35,280
right we are we are members of the board of a public charity we're not representing anyone with our

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,599
position here even if we're i was an affiliate i was nominated by another

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,480
affiliate and elected as such on a seat but

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,680
i'm not representing the wikimedia foundation and my duties

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,160
to the board of directors of the osi the other part i would like to mention to

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,119
the to the substance of the question of our

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,079
direction to a staff board i think this would actually make

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,359
it easier for volunteers to be in the board because they won't

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,200
have to you know the current arrangement is at the board

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
in different degrees for each of us is a

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,720
working board right like we're doing work as part of our

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,560
participation in the board of directors i'm one of the

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,000
people who do less work compared to some of my peers i think

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,880
it's challenging for for someone that is perhaps another day

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
job to also be in this board and do work for it if we're

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,760
an organization that's relies more on the staff to do the work

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,079
and the volunteers on the board there to provide strategy and direction

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,160
and oversight then i think it will become if

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,839
even easier for more volunteers to be part of the sport

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,520
more people that are not do not have open source in their

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,599
day job they're not working full-time as a community manager for company or an

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,240
open source role um deb did you want to follow up yeah

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,560
very very briefly to go to another question

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,240
Faidon i'm glad you explained that this is not a

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,720
representative board that if a person happens to work for a

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
company they don't represent that company it's

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,440
very very distinct not unlike the apache foundation where

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,240
anyone who on the other the apache foundation board

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,079
doesn't is not they're not representing an employer they may have

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,920
i have a really long view i wanted to mention just to give you a final

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,280
perspective on corporate contribution and

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,440
influence in my history of the board goes back to about 2007

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,000
i was involved in our first wave of governance reform

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,640
before we had any member any membership before we did any elections and we went

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,520
to our corporate sponsors we had actually one

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,240
they were surprised to find out which would have been ibm for 10 years

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,599
and as we started talking to corporate sponsors about participating

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,960
we had originally intended for them to have a seat and

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,319
uniformly said no we don't want to be involved

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,079
in governance for osi what we want is for osi

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,160
to do their job to make sure the ecosystem is

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,119
protected that the osd is defended that we can rely on open source licenses

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,160
that's really what we need from you we need you guys to do that

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,280
so really important to understand that relationship because i do

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,400
i understand the express concern about corporate influence

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,480
that's always important with nonprofits but that's been the history and the

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
experience we've had with corporate participation to date

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,280
with osi excellent and you can always spread

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,079
it out by donating more as an individual if you

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,560
like we won't stop you let's go ahead this was a lot of

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,520
internal i have a we skipped over a question that's a

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,000
little bit more external as osi refocuses where do you see the

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,240
org fitting in with the larger ecosystem of floss related orgs

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,319
and then it says related to that is marketing the concept of open source

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,960
the best use of time versus a license focus license focus or something else

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,800
can other orgs be allies in marketing the concept

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,040
of open source i assume does anyone want to speak yeah josh

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,960
i'll just start with this one real briefly so part of the work

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,520
that we're doing right now is not just sort of governance reform and

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,359
operationalizing things but we're also setting strategy because for

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,599
a while osi has been sort of a year-to-year

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,960
strategy setting organization and we found that

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,920
is frankly been inadequate in preparing us to rise to the challenges that we

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,160
face and so we're undertaking a multi-year

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,000
planning process and strategy setting process and so

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,960
while that's in flight i can't give you terribly specific answers on this note

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,800
but i think there's at least one general thing that i can i can safely say

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,400
which is that our affiliate the affiliate membership program

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,000
was really spun up with this in mind

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,800
with the idea that you know osi derives it's power

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,680
its influence you know only through the consent of the community that we serve

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,319
and only through you know the alliance with with all of these people who share

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,520
an understanding of the open source definition

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,839
and so i expect that working with our affiliate members and

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,000
people who aren't yet our affiliate members

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
just or other organizations generally is absolutely going to be

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,079
core to how we proceed because while we can we are certainly

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,960
working to improve our capabilities and do more

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,280
we can never do everything and frankly it doesn't make sense for osi to

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,319
do everything and so where we find that there are

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,880
organizations that are allied who have a core

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,640
a specialization in an area you know we would love to support them in network

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,000
and not only have osi support them but rally the rest

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,079
of our allies to support them as well yeah i've got this this lovely scarf

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,880
back here it says floss united thank you molly leblanc and all the

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,040
other folks who had a hand in crafting that

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,200
and that was a a piece of swag that was a joint fundraising drive for

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,119
software freedom conservancy open source initiative see there's patrick's

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,119
and also for the free software foundation and i think

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
that's emblematic of where we want to go we want

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,000
to move together as a community of of individuals and organizations

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,280
and marketing the the the benefits of open source and the

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,400
meaning of open source that's definitely gonna be part of it

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,599
but it's hard to say what that whole tool box looks like at this moment

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,520
but i can assure you that we're gonna look to be a partner

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,800
with the whole ecosystem as we endeavor and to take on this work

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,560
and i'm not sure if anyone wants to speak to this but i know that

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,599
since floss united there's been a push from

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,440
within the board to not only partner with other u.s

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,960
free software organizations but to partner more internationally i don't

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,960
know if anyone wants to speak to some of that work

00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,079
or just take my word for it can i ask patrick to

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,119
talk a little bit about our relationship with the free software foundation europe

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
oh yeah

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,319
you didn't think you're going to get out without answering anything did you

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,280
well yeah i feel a little awkward yeah so yes the fsfe

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,760
and the osi have been working together

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,040
on a few initiatives now i'm trying to remember maybe three

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,960
four years of activities gosh some of them include things like

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,480
public dollars public code

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,119
issues around standards we we sent deb and pam over to

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,160
participate in the discussions that were happening around

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,960
standards in brussels i know i believe

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,920
italo is also working with the fsfe kde which is has a big

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,079
group obviously based in germany we've been working with them so

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,359
trying to reach out with to other organizations to leverage

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,960
their expertise their communities their activities

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,880
you know there's sort of a saying that while i was at the osi

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,960
sort of more joiners and fewer starters and so i think that

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,079
that attitude has always been one of the driving forces behind the affiliate

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,119
program in order to find partners that we can do things with

00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,680
complement one another so matthias and i have been

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,440
working quite a bit on a few things whether conference events

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,319
the you have to forgive me it's been like a month

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,040
of me not thinking much about the open source initiative but

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,200
the conference in bolzano every year we participate in

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,560
which led to all sorts of partnerships that's where the

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,560
fuss community came from the italian schools

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,079
so yeah i think there's a lot of opportunities that exist

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,079
and the challenge with the osi has always been

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,599
do we have enough resources to take advantage do have enough

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,359
internal resources to take advantage of all the opportunities that are out there

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,000
that's always been the challenge i would open

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,680
my email every day with so many energetic

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,040
interesting important projects being offered hey can we get help with

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,280
this oh we see you're doing this we like to participate

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,520
and i just we just didn't have the capacity to take that on

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,839
i think what the osi board is doing now by

00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,960
by honing itself in order to take advantage of these

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,599
opportunities is really the next level that has to happen because

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,119
it's not for lack of interest on the osi's part it's for

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,319
lack of resources and people to be able to respond in that way so

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,760
i know that the osi not only would love to but has the opportunity to take

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,280
to work with all these different groups not just in europe we have

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,040
outreach to asia african organizations are more and more involved

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,400
in our affiliate groups now and it's just a shame that

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
all the potential that's there can't be realized

00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:01,200
and i applaud just i'm still a member so um i applaud the work that they're

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,599
doing to take advantage of these operators and

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,319
recognize that that is a gap that needs to be filled

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:11,119
sorry blabbed on... that was fabulous and i'll just i'll just briefly add

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,440
concretely you know in the last year and a half we have i think actually two

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,680
years we've added uh fossasia linux australia

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,280
and open source community africa to to our affiliates

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,440
so just an example of how we are making really deliberate efforts to

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,880
increase international representation excellent

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,880
yeah so go ahead yes i also want to actually

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,640
we make a lot of efforts to to connect with the community in asia

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,559
and in africa as patrick says so i also like represent osi

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,359
in different user groups in southeast asia if you ever want to be

00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,800
to get connected with the osi please contact me

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,280
if you are outside there in asia and i just want to mention to deb that i

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,520
think we could take number five because i

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,640
think that there's also some similar question to number five

00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,040
asking how a new members could support this growing

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,559
community and they asked for different answers from the board

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,520
so we only have about five minutes so maybe it's a good question to to get the

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,440
input from all the members of the board here that's a great suggestion

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,559
so the question is what's one tip you

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,400
have for new osi members who are actively looking to support this growing

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,480
community and it would be great to get answers

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,599
from different members so just one tip and then we're going to wrap it up

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,760
hong phuc you put it out there do you want to go first

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,240
yes i can go first so

00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,520
this so if you work for a company or an organization so try to promote

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,760
open source they use open source contribute to open source from your

00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:02,240
perspective wherever you are anyone else with one tip for

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,240
new folks chris go ahead well one way to contribute to the osi is to

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,319
through the affiliates so if you if you know a particular affiliate but it's

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,440
particularly aligns with your interests or in your particular geographic area

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,920
freezing you know open uk for example or fossasia i mean contributing to

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,839
that not only contributed to open source in

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,920
general and all the great things that come with that but

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,800
also it you know it sort of follows up to

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,079
to osi itself so yeah so through the affiliates

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,960
is is my tip

00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,520
elana maybe oh calling on me on this one i

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,400
definitely want to echo what chris said i think there's a bunch of us on the

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,640
board who are all, for example, affiliated uh with the debian project

00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,079
and like obviously my my service on the osi

00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,119
board is my contribution to osi but it's not my

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,319
only contribution to the open source ecosystem

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,640
i'm on the debian technical committee and i maintain lots of packages and

00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,559
debian i am a sig lead in the kubernetes

00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,960
project and i kind of consider that like all you know to be relevant like just

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,599
being a good open source citizen and

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,119
contributing to community in the best way you can whether that's you know

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,800
volunteering to help organize events or to like write code write

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,440
documentation do graphic design help with triage and project

00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,400
management like there's so many ways that you can get involved

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,800
and like i'm always of the fan when people are like how do i get involved in

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,920
open source or this particular project or something like that i say well what

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,720
do you care about you know what do you want to improve

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,200
what do you have a stake in go in that direction and that sort

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,079
of drove me to join the osi board because i said

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,599
well i have a stake in this because you know i think that the organization

00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,839
could be performing better it's not performing up to its potential it in

00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,400
theory like you know represents this huge

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,880
breadth of stakeholders and right now it's very focused in its

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,160
in in who it engages with and its

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,280
activities so how can we improve that how can we

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,000
broaden that what would my strategy be as a board

00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,960
member to do that so i mean obviously you don't have to

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,960
join the board but i'd be thrilled if you ran

00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:29,599
so i'm going to make the suggestion without vetting it with deb there first

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,640
but if you want to engage more with osi and

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,440
you're not sure how to get started there are a number of things that aren't as

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,280
apparent so as an example we have a public policy working group

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,800
meaning that's just a list right now that we need to you know grow into a

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,880
more active group so my suggestion is write down what you're passionate about

00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,119
what your skills are what your interests are

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,119
send an email to deb nicholson and say when you're ready

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,240
i'd like you to tell me what my opportunity might be to volunteer

00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,839
or what else already exists that i can latch onto

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,640
so keep that in mind maybe a shortcut to really matching up the thing that you

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,359
you can do yourself and we might find something for you here inside the

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,440
organization or i might say that your best

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,839
bet is to work on getting more open source and use at your company

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,520
and your day job and you know getting your

00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,280
your company to be a good open source citizen to borrow elana's

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,359
phrasing does anyone else want to add on

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:37,040
how new osi members can get involved i i think there is

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,559
one thing that should be clear is that you don't need

00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:47,119
to be technically skilled to participate in open source there is a

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,880
lot of space for everyone i have a degree in humanities and

00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:01,520
i started contributing in communication in the open office project 18 years ago

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,200
and that is was just the start then i discovered that i could do a lot more

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,559
localization all software is basically written in english

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:19,040
but there are 140 language or even more in the world and many people do not

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,079
speak english or not fluent in english so

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,000
localizing the software writing documentation

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,079
helping with q and a there is really

00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,040
fostering the community helping the community

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,079
there are there is quite a lot for people that is

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,720
not technically skilled or as not strong technical skills so it's

00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,880
don't be shy i think that being shy

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,839
is the only real issue

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,760
i'll go ahead and jump in just with a brief plug

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,079
since everybody's made all these fabulous suggestions i'm going to go

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,359
ahead and slide in with a slightly slightly selfish suggestion if i

00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,280
may say so myself i would really encourage

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,520
everybody everybody to become an osi individual member there's a cost

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,920
associated with that it's like 40 bucks a year

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,359
we waive that cost for students and people who just can't afford it

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,720
we want you as an individual member so that

00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,640
you get communications from us that you get a voice in our board elections

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,359
and that you're just sort of engaged with all of the activities that we're

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,880
doing beyond individual membership affiliate

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,000
membership has already been mentioned i will just say reflect on

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,520
the value you get out of open source you're not just

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,680
any philosophical alignment you may have on it but really what has open source

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,880
done for your career how much value do you get out of it how much value does

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,400
your company get out of it and if your company is not a sponsor of

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,880
osi and if they're a tech company they're

00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,440
definitely using open source software i mean everybody's

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,839
using open source software one way or the other if they are not a sponsor

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,839
they would be extraordinarily helpful if you could start making that case

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,880
you know and even if you can't make that case connect them with us

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,640
connect them with deb because we would we would love their support and you

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,799
know every every additional member every additional sponsor just helps us

00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,359
be that much more effective in serving the community

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,280
okay don't forget that contributing to open source is a huge

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,160
amount of fun

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,559
excellent there were a couple of questions i'm just going to

00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,720
let folks know that we're going to take this on later because i don't think we

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,720
quite have a chance to open a whole new topic on

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,640
is part of our plan to look at ways to help on-road or on-ramp

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,400
newcomers and beginners and new contributors and

00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,839
josh i know you said you're we're kind of refocusing and maybe we don't totally

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,400
have a the most solid answer to that yet but

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,359
it's something we're kind of looking at this year

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,480
i don't know if you want to add to that or not since we're

00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,400
just we're about to get the moderator in join our mailing list watch our twitter

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,599
we we will not be quiet about the

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,480
community engagement work that's that that we're going to be rolling out

00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,040
we will be loud and proud of all the opportunities that that we

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,720
sort of set up for people to get involved

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,839
and it's not just about creating the opportunities it is about creating that

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,079
on-ramp and you know meeting people where

00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,720
they're at in their journey with open source

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,520
so just stay tuned and in the meantime while we're getting

00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,880
our work done don't hesitate to send us your feedback or your suggestions

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,920
because you know that that can inform the

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,839
decisions that we make

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,799
excellent anyone else have any closing thoughts or shall we
