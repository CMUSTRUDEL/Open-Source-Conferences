	The role of open source in education: a case study with robotics and AI
Marco A. Gutierrez 

Lots of money is being lost on poor quality education that is failing to ensure that children learn. 773 million adults remain illiterate and 617 million children and adolescents do not achieve minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics according to UNESCO. Free and Open Source models can help reduce costs and improve accessibility to education as well as provide the means to rethink a system that maintains structures and methods unaltered for the past centuries.
