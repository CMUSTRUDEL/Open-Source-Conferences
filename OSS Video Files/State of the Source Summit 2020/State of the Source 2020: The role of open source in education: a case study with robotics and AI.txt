Description: 
	The role of open source in education: a case study with robotics and AI
Marco A. Gutierrez 

Lots of money is being lost on poor quality education that is failing to ensure that children learn. 773 million adults remain illiterate and 617 million children and adolescents do not achieve minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics according to UNESCO. Free and Open Source models can help reduce costs and improve accessibility to education as well as provide the means to rethink a system that maintains structures and methods unaltered for the past centuries.

hello my name is marco i'm here to discuss with you the role of

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,599
open source in education and also to present

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,600
specifically one of our test workshops in robotics

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
and ai

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
so for those of you that don't know me very well

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,000
i'm just going to give a little bit of background about myself

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,760
i did computer science and my college years and then i went through a

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,879
phd in robotics which is my passion nowadays i did um

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:54,079
i did work as a head of data science in a private academy uh

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,440
a few years back so i've done quite a little bit of teaching

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
and right now i'm a software engineer at open robotics

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,439
which is my current job and sometimes i

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,560
collaborate with foss asia i help them run events like the big summit in

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,119
singapore or i also go around give some talks or

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,600
even do some workshops as the one we're

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,640
presenting here today

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
so i want to give first some stats about education right

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
even though um education has been improving

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,600
through the years and if you see as wage has been improving

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
um education has been improving along with it

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,159
and we all live better and there's more people that has access to it

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
but there's still some numbers that we can improve

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,840
there and and there's a bit um there's quite a lot of of people that

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,879
are still illiterate in the world and you can see here

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,440
the numbers by unesco and at least around 50 percent

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
of the people in the world still don't know how to read

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,760
or if we put that in numbers it's about 750 million

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
which is still a high number for me so i think we can still do

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,040
something about it right

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,239
so i want to go through different um different parts of the educational

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
system so i want to have a look at different

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
aspects of it uh methods uh the cause of that the

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,040
accessibility that is out there and then i want to

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,239
have a look at how foss can help in these fields

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,560
so it can help reduce costs it can help ease the access i can help bring in new

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,319
ways and methods and and what are these how we can

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,879
achieve these things and then i'll give you guys the example

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
of the robotics workshop that we've done

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
and then we'll run into from some questions

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:28,080
about um what we can do to improve education in the world

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,959
all right so a very

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,959
uh typical view of education is to see education as a social progress

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,120
right so a developed country uh

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
once i get to the age i start attending school

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,319
and from a very early age at a certain point i pursue a degree

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,239
and once i get that degree i specialize in a certain field

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
and i get a job in order to contribute to society

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,720
right that is the basic view of education in the developed world in a

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,479
capitalist country um however i will

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
still look at education in a more complete way

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,360
not only in in this traditional way i think education should be able to

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,199
produce knowledgeable human beings that

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,000
are critical thinkers and humane and civilized members of society

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,320
and are also able to expand their own knowledge

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,919
into new fields and they're also able to educate others like explain

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,919
themselves to others and and and share their knowledge with other

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,520
people so i think this these are certain points

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
that education should should also achieve to create a

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,479
better society

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,960
so now let's let's have a look at certain general characteristics of the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
current education system

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,840
so the first um the first aspect of education that we're

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,400
going to have a look at the the methods that are being used

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,639
and i would like to point out that even though it's not the more

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,440
the most um um it's not used everywhere um beside the

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,520
research pointing out on good results on active learning um

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,800
some some places they're still using um the the passive learning method right

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,919
and it's it's still a generic a generic way of teaching uh

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
even though the passive learning has given us a certain

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,479
level of success

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
that's probably why it remains unmodified since roman times right

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:16,000
so there's still um this this this this um tend towards

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,720
passive learning you can see similarities in the picture

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,080
from roman classroom on the left to a regular class from college nowadays

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,479
and and it still remains the same right

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
i want to give a good example of of a strict application of this method

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,080
and and and i think singapore is it's one of these examples

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,720
um i live in singapore so i know a little bit about it and it's

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
a very challenging city it's a it's a it's a thing it's a city that

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
that has uh very specific ways of doing

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,599
things compared to other countries and

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
i've been discussing this with with some other uh

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,360
peers and and friends and we um we agree on on on this sort of

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,919
sort of points i'm putting here right um so we we can say that singapore is is

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,039
an example of how this traditional education is

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,960
implemented right and the main focus on on singapore

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,240
education it's it's good test results and that is

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,639
that that drifts the whole education in in singapore and it will it will

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,800
it will just decide your career as a student in singapore

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,720
so as a result singapore is usually the top country or or one of the top

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
countries in educational tests in the world

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
so that is that is the the good results that we get

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,840
however there is a bit of a lack of young entrepreneurs um

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,360
even though despite the government entities that

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
really push for startups here still

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,199
some young students will instead choose more conservative

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,840
and stable careers aided by statutories hiring quotas

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,879
so even though the the the the means to to create startups

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,360
are there by governments because of a more traditional educational system

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,399
there there is uh somehow a lack of innovation

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,680
in in in the society that that is produced by the educational

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
system

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,680
now let's have a look at the cost of education right which is

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,519
also a very conservational topic the king of the cost of education of

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,760
course is the united states uh it's a place where the price of

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,040
college has been increasing and is the highest in the world and in

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,600
fact you can see on the picture on the right

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,920
that student loans make up the largest chunk of

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,320
u.s non-house debt so it's quite a bit um in the u.s

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
however besides the u.s being the most costly

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,959
it's not where education costs it's a bigger problem

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,000
so if we look at this comparison of countries

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,279
related to the salary you can see that countries like hungary romania or

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,760
estonia they have to spend quite a big chunk of

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,240
the average salary if they want to access education right

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
so these high costs on education not only prevent people from

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,959
basic learning but they also are preventing them to achieve higher

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,480
educations which is where um humans become

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:19,279
a more beneficial um more beneficial to society right

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
another aspect of education is accessibility

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,000
so it's very important to have information access

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,440
and an internet speed is is one of the ways of have information access nowadays

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
right and this is something that we all have

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,399
in developed countries but there's undeveloped countries that are

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,720
still lacking some internet speed access to video

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,760
conference now in especially in days of of covid like we are this year right

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,880
it's very important a lot of things going on online like this conference

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,079
and a lot of a lot of classes going on online

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,880
and and i saw the other day in hacker news a post by a brazilian guy

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
that was complaining of the lack of tools

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,880
to to assist on on low bandwidth video conference and and they they

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,360
they couldn't access um classes right so there's this there's a

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,959
lot of things that can be done then there's also a lack of

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,399
untrained teachers there's lack of equipments and there's

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
like on classrooms on these developed countries so a lot of

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,959
room to improve in those areas so what can

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,720
free and open source software and methods do

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,480
in these areas in terms of costs there's many things that can be done in

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,639
terms of costs so for licenses is one of the first ones

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,320
that can come to mind very um easy one if

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
if i have a school and i have to buy software licenses for every single

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,519
software that i run on my computers and the computers that students are

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,000
using that's a high cost so open source license can help overcome

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,440
this cost open source textbooks that's a that's

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,360
another important issue so textbooks also become

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,920
a very high cost for many families and having them

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
open source not only can reduce this cost

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,440
but can also make them easier to improve and update i want to shout out the

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
project opentab openstack so it's a it's a project that is that is

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,399
developing open source textbooks and materials

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,160
and it's a very interesting project so i i encourage you to have a look at it

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,519
um also the open source projects can can also

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,639
bring local production so we have open source have

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:14,079
open hardware so can can also reduce cost by by producing locally

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,240
or even as we said with this with the textbooks you can

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,800
you can produce them locally also the ability to repair

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,240
your own products like if you have if you have computers

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
uh or if you have software and they they're broken or they don't work you

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,160
can also work on that so that also brings down

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,399
the cost hit a voice window login so any any type

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
of technology that you're using that is free and open source you can

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
also uh find someone locally to to help you

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,160
fix it instead of having to to to call someone from from another

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,680
company wait let me go back yeah and finally

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,000
there's uh there's the possibility of reusing projects right

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
because if we are doing free and open source software people can just work on

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,399
top of your project and and it's something that it's easier

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,199
for them to learn

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,320
in terms of accessibility so free and open source software it's always

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,680
available so we have materials available we will

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,680
have we would have code available we would

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
have hardware design available so everything

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,000
is available on on the internet there's software

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,079
adaptability so that means that we we we would be

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,240
able to adapt software to different

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,480
needs right so i was talking about uh video conference software if it's open

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,959
source then then can easily be adapted for for lower

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,320
bandwidth even though the main product was not

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,279
designed for that right so that is an example and also

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,000
it allows to learn through exploration right so open source gives you the

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,519
the whole thing for you to explore so that enables students to

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,279
grab whatever piece of software or hardware

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,199
and and be able to to modify it by themselves have a look at it how it's

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,800
done and and how how they can improve it how they

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,120
can they can modify it how and and learn through

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,440
through through the process and it also enables communities so this

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,000
is a thing that can be also brought into um learning and communities can

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,120
expand the experience of of learning more like in a in a bigger sense that

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,839
only your local community so nowadays we live in a connected world

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,120
and and having communities beyond our local communities is very important

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
and it can also help you expand your

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,199
knowledge on certain topics and also documentation as if we have

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,360
documentations with open licenses this can be shared this

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,079
can also create people that can improve them and

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,240
and can be also accessed as a lower cost right

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,440
now regarding the method we should try to bring learning

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
communities together right these learning communities have

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,199
have to be technologically enabled have to be able to share information

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
between them and being able to co-author their

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,120
learning experience so this is as i'm going through a

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,079
learning experience i should also be part of it right

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,639
this is this is the instead of like just being a listener in a room i'm also

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,679
being an active uh having an active role in that

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,079
in that experience um however there's some this uh there's a

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,199
there's a lack of of evaluation that we should not compromise

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
so there's there's tons of free information

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,640
out there there's tons of open information and it's very nice nowadays

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,160
how much information a student can get on the internet

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
but the

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,200
a student can still attend an mit course uh for free there's this almost all of

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,360
them are online however the actual credentials

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,720
will still be super expensive so i think the

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,679
foss community has uh

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,640
has to try to provide means for evaluation of these concepts

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,600
so actual students that cannot attend an mit class at the actual

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,960
mit and get and pay for those credentials

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,280
can somehow get a similar

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,520
evaluation even though if they were not at the at the place or didn't pay

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
for the credentials so that is that is the thing that is an

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,720
important point where where free and open source

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,440
communities can help to get accessibility

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,960
into into into learning

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
so things that uh more things that open source

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,000
can do it's that we can enable personal growth

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,400
of the students we can be able to eliminate barriers between

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,039
between different communities and we should try to provide

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,720
project-based learning to to the students

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,320
instead of just just learning things as it is

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
having a target that can help them achieve

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,160
a goal um foss should also encourage exploration

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,440
which is uh given that the the the source is already there and and

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,280
the information is is always open now we should also try to encourage

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,360
group interaction so with with these bigger online

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,400
communities should be able to basically

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,720
uh bring them on board new learners and and try to promote them

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,000
in into some uh more active learning all together so

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,320
i will now talk about uh robotics um workshop which was done under the

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,840
foss asia academy so let's get into it so the workshop is done with the support

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,600
from foss asia it's a project from foss asia it's

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,640
called pslab and it's mainly it stands for pocket

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,000
science lab and it's mainly meant for experimental things

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,760
so you can you can do different things with this board

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,280
at different levels right so it has uh many many things like a wave

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,760
generator it has a logic analyzer and you can

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,960
connect sensors you can do all these things with uh with

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,159
the pocket science lab right so what we did is that we brought this

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,559
piece of open hardware and and we connected to the

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
me arm so a me arm it's also an open design

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,360
uh it's a it's an open design of a robot that you can cut in in pretty much a

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,280
wide range of materials we did it in wood

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,720
because it was the material that we had available at the time

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,760
we attached four servers to it and and we connected these servers

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:35,280
to the ps lab right so what happens is that now the

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,360
ps lab can be connected to a to a cell phone or a computer and you

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,120
should be able to run and move around your robot

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
so what we did is that we created a bunch of

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,600
groups and these groups were able to collaborate together

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,880
follow a certain basic instructions on how to build this

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,919
this robot and in the end they would they they were able to

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,080
connect it to to a ps lab and then connect the ps lab

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,960
to a cell phone or a computer and then work on it right so what did we

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
achieve with it so with it we managed to bring robotics

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,840
at a very low cost robotics is a very expensive field

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,559
and we managed to bring a robotics workshop at a very low cost

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,840
to students right so that was a very good point

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,760
we also managed to get them to work into some project-based learning

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,679
so they could pro they could work um into building something it's uh

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,880
it was it was based in groups so they all collaborate and they

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,280
they share the experience and they communicate with each other

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
they encour we encourage interaction between these groups

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
and they all also interaction with all the groups

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
from outside was also encouraged

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
the good thing about this being open source is that

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,320
it allows the workshop to be adapted to many different levels

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,360
so we have a full application you don't need to

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,120
learn how to program you can just run the

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,559
the robot with your own cell phone however

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,200
if you really want to if you really want to

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,320
program the the whole structure of the of the robot you can just do it using a

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,039
python library so that it's uh or you can even modify

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,400
the pantheon the python library because everything is open source you

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,720
can even modify pslab and you can create your own board for uh

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,520
moving around the robot also we believe these workshops

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,720
uh will encourage active explorations and will bring uh

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
knowledge communities uh around the world

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
so we think it's a good experience so we run this workshop

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,799
in qinghua university in shenzhen china we also run it a travel maker which is a

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,520
co-working space there and we have run it in the lifelong

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,799
learning institute in singapore with very bring success

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,840
finally open source can bring learning costs down can improve

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,159
accessibility can increment students interests

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,279
can enable self learning through co-authoring as the

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:48,320
license allows you to explore more can enable community interactions

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,039
through these amazing communities that we have

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,039
in open source if we bring them into the learning space

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,919
and can some should uh try to come up with evaluation

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,000
processes as i said um students should

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,760
if they have access to the information if they have access to the

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,720
learning experience there shouldn't be a need to

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
to attend a certain college or to pay a certain fee

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:28,960
to be able to get a certification that proves the their knowledge in that

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,279
field

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,120
so yeah i think technology enables education

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,640
and it's been proven that education information is more accessible nowadays

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,039
but i think as an open source community we can do much

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,720
more in this field so i hope the

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,480
keys that i gave on this presentation can

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,799
uh encourage everyone to walk in these fields and towards

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,679
these goals and thank you very much um if you have

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,600
any questions i think there's a few minutes um if

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,039
not you can always drop me an email thank you very much

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,799
um yeah sorry i was looking at the chat um

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,320
i yeah i really think that's um that's the

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,360
the biggest challenge here uh certification is

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,120
is uh it's a big problem nowadays there's a lot of information out there there's a lot

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,760
of information available but still as i said the

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,400
certification is is what what is is costing uh most of

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,880
the in terms of costs right if you talk in

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,120
terms of cost is the biggest challenge that we uh we have to overcome

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,000
i think um the there's no um means for for

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,159
to overcome this this issue and nowadays as i said you can you can

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,840
you can attend even classes from stanford mit be it top

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,919
um top universities but to get the certification

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,120
you you must pay um like a quarter million dollars if you want to get like

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,320
a degree on any of those um i think

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,200
people can can get the this knowledge by themselves

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
but we're still lacking the means that means to

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,279
to help um and certify and verify that these people

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,720
have the knowledge i think that's that's a that's a future challenge

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,080
that we as a open source community should try to address in terms of the

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,399
improving the learning learning access and

00:27:50,399 --> 00:28:03,840
cost for for other people thank you

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
