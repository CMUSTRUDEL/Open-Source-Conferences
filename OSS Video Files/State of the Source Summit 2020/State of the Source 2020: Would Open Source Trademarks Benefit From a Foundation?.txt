Description: 
	Would Open Source Trademarks Benefit From a Foundation?
Pamela Chestek 

In July, Google announced the creation of the Open Usage Commons, described as a neutral, independent ownership for trademarks to “give peace of mind regarding their use of project names in a fair and transparent way.” Unique challenges specific to licensing of trademarks aside, are there problems with how the open source world uses trademarks? If so, is an independent entity the best way to solve the problems?

so welcome to state of the source this is the talk on would open source

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,639
trademarks benefit from a foundation

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,240
inspired by the announcement in july of 2020

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,840
that google was creating the open usage commons

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,519
which was an entity designed specifically for the ownership of open

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,560
source trademarks the google announcement said

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
specifically that it would not provide services outside the realm of

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,719
usage such as technical mentorship community management project events or

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
project marketing strictly on trademarks so as a trademark

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
lawyer one working in open source i found that to be a really interesting

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,120
concept and so read up with some interest and i

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,480
found some assumptions in the google announcement that i thought were very

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
interesting and worth sort of further discussion on

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,039
so one of them the first assumption is that an independent foundation

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
can do a better job at managing trademarks than the project itself can

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,119
second is that there's uncertainty about how others can use open source

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,920
trademarks the third i find the most most

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
interesting which is that trademarks should be available in a free and fair

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
way and then finally trademarks of open

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,960
source projects are used in ways contrary to the open source definition

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,799
um so these are the this is what we're going to talk about what i'm going to

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,520
talk about during this session a little bit about myself i am a board

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
member of the open source initiative i am board certified by the north

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
carolina state bar's board of legal specialization in trademark law

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880
and i'm required to say that full phrase as a matter to avoid false advertising

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
um i've been writing about ownership of trademark specifically about ownership

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,280
of trademarks for about 20 years first article was in 2001 called control

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,240
of trademarks by the intellectual property holding company

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,119
which is a concept not very different from what we're talking about today

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,920
just a side note i have a sling on it was a self-inflicted injury

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,599
for those of you who know me you'll not be surprised to know that it was bicycle

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
accident so um this presentation

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
is only i'm only speaking of u.s law here

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
some of the concepts i'm going to talk about are very specific to u.s

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,959
law so they may come out differently in other legal jurisdictions

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,040
so the first question is can an independent foundation do a better job

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,239
at managing trademarks than the project itself can

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,959
and i'm gonna go with with sometimes yes so uh and the reason i say that is

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
trademarks often don't get enough attention from the projects

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
um their true value i think is underestimated by

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
the by the project so the more attention we get on

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
trademarks and projects i think the the better off

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,959
everyone is going to be but formalizing ownership of assets

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
is not a new concept that's what fiscal sponsors do

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,000
software in the public interest which owns the debian trademarks has

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,159
been around for 23 years but they generally do more than just

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
the trademarks themselves sort of the distinction that the in that the google

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
press release was making um the trademark in my view as a

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
trademark lawyer the trademark is often the most valuable

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,480
and often the only real true asset that that the project owns so paying

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,920
particular attention to its ownership makes a lot of sense

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
and i i think it makes even more sense for open source projects

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
uh than maybe other types of entities or other types of businesses because of

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
this collaborative nature of the development of the software

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,959
often a large number of contributors so so i think it makes a lot of sense to

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,280
um to think about that and and figure out

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,200
who the owner of the trade market who the owner of the trademark is when i

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,360
talk about trademark ownership one of the things i'm talking

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
about under u.s law particularly this is one thing that's very different and

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,599
differs from country to country is in the united states a trademark

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,000
does not have to be registered to be owned a trademark exists

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
whether or not it's registered and it is owned whether or not it is registered

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,280
in the united states registration is simply the recognition

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,759
of um it's a it's a you know government recognition of those trademark rights

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,479
that already exist so words logos whatever

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
they are they do exist in the absence of

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,800
registration but the registration formalizes the ownership

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
and there's also one more point about unregistered trademarks there's a

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,199
misconception that there has to be some kind of

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,880
legal entity government recognized entity to own a trademark

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,520
that's not true trademarks can be owned by individuals they can be owned

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
jointly by two or three people they of course can be owned by corporations or

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,040
limited liability companies they can be owned by partnerships and

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
they can be owned by unincorporated associations

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,039
and those last two i mentioned those two do not necessarily have formal

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,280
government recognition they just come into existence um there's

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
no formation required they exist because they're people who've

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,440
combined together to um for a joint purpose

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,320
uh and those are so those are also recognized entities that can uh register

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,759
trademarks and and this is something that probably

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
we see pretty commonly in open source trademarks is it's a

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,160
partnership or an incorporated association that actually

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
is the collective unit or the collective you know the

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
entity the unitary entity that that would be the trademark owner

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,720
um but in thinking about whether or not a trademark should be in a non-profit

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
uh one thing to keep in mind is no matter what the nonprofit is whether

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
it's a more fully formed fiscal sponsor or

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
whether it's just a design specifically for the trademark as

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,800
a non-profit there are legal restrictions

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
on how they can dispose of their assets so if

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,280
to get the trademark back there may be some constraints on

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
on how and when you can get that trademark back and you may have to

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,720
reimburse the um the nonprofit for that trademark so

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
that's not function of trademark law that's a function of

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,080
tax law so what's very different between trademarks

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,520
and patents or copyrights is the concept that the trademark is owned

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
by the person or entity who controls the quality of the goods and services

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,319
that is the ownership and the control are indivisible you can't have legal

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,560
ownership in one entity and yet have a different

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
entity controlling you know the quality of

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
those goods and services available under the under the trademark we look and see

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
where is the control that's who owns it kind of no matter

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
no matter what the records say no matter what the registration says

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
um who's who's controlling it is the actual owner so

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
if you try to so if there is a challenge and you find that the control is in one

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
is in one place but the record owner is someone else then that's going to

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,199
invalidate that registration so

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
if if you are truly assigning your trademark to any any entity

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,319
you are giving up a degree of control with that um

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,120
the degree of control that you have over the quality of your goods and services

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
but we'll assume for purposes of this discussion that that problem can be

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,880
solved by smart lawyers that there will be mechanisms in place to make sure that

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
the trademark will remain valid and we'll also assume that they're going

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
to be contractual safeguards in place to ensure that the that the owner will

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
only act in ways consistent with the project's desires that they're not going

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,319
to sort of you know go off and do whatever

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,720
they want with the trademark and start licensing it off to

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
all sorts of people in the ways that would be that the project

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,319
the project contributors would be unhappy about so i i do think that

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
there's a role for um some kind of owner someone who's

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
paying attention to the assets of the entity

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
to make sure that they're um that they're well taken care of

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,840
including the trademark um the next question is there

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
uncertainty about hope about how open source trademarks can be

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,080
used and i i give it a qualified no um

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,599
which i'll explain which which is to my knowledge there is no trademark

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,800
right that can interfere with the full use of the software

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
as granted in any open source license and this is true

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,959
because trademarks and copyrights are directed at different interests

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,920
so they can they can very um you know comfortably coexist with each

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
other the copyright is the right to use the code

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
and the trademark is the right to publicly inform

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,120
people that you are using the code so i don't see those as

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
as necessarily

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
one that they necessarily follow each other so yes you can use the code but

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,120
does that mean that you get to then promote your product as having as having

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,880
that code or you know using the name but using the

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,120
same name for your code i don't i think that there are that's

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
that's why i don't see that there's any kind of

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,920
incongruity between copyright and trademark

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,160
um if when the trademark owner tries to overreach tries to claim that trademark

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,279
um allows them to require something that isn't required

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,800
there are legal doctrines in place that protect the user

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,080
that allow the user to continue to use the trademark um

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
i don't want to i'm not going to go into them right now if you have some

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
particular questions where you see that what the statement

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
i've made is not true um put it in the chat and hopefully

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
we'll have some time at the end to talk about it

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
um so largely what i see is is a misunderstanding about what the law

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,320
actually permits and doesn't permit a trademark laws is a delicately balanced

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
system for with rules for when you wait when

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
you may and may not use others treat others trade

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,600
others trademarks and when i when i look at this system in any um

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,959
when i look at the system and use of open source trademarks it all makes

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,240
sense it all fits to me about when when you someone must be

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
allowed to use a trademark when they can use the trademark when they may use the

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
trademark when they shouldn't be allowed to use

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
the trademark all of that there is legal doctrine for all of that

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,519
but you're going to have um bad or even well-intentioned actors who try to

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,959
claim that under the color of trademark that because of the trademark

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,680
that some lawful behavior is prohibited and i'm going to go into that a little

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,519
bit later so trademark guidelines

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
i think play an important role to clear up uncertainty

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,000
so as with any law there is you know um haze at the edges there's not bright

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,200
lines necessarily and so trademark guidelines are very useful to for the

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
trademark owner to state what they believe is a lawful

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
use like if you use this the trademark this way

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
we're perfectly good with that we won't we won't bother you with that we think

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
that that's loft and you're allowed to to do that i also believe that trademark

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
guidelines um have to be customized to the owner's

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
particular needs every project has different products

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,560
different interests so just in terms of of the software

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,200
itself um mozilla has made the the choice that

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
it will only allow the firefox browser to be called firefox if

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,480
it's the if it's their build of the binary and that

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
that is i believe a legitimate choice to make because

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,480
the trademark is your quality assurance um and so it's only fair for the

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,200
trademark owner to say this is what i'm willing to

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,160
to have bear my good name and you know draw the line where they

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,639
where they wouldn't where they don't want to allow that

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
libreoffice takes a more somewhat more liberal view

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
and they allow some in their trademark guidelines you'll you'll find some kinds

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,480
of modifications you can um reskin you can change

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,279
languages and you can still call it libra office

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
but you know they're fairly modest changes

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,279
um to still call it libreoffice kubernetes takes a different

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
uh angle they have conformance testing so as long as you pass the test you can

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
call it kubernetes um it's very similar to the way that

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,000
java java does it so you know three very

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,480
different ways of approaching when someone gets to use the trademark

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
and all you know well described in in their in their documentation another

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
thing that trademark guidelines can do is grant licenses in trademark it

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
licenses the trademark so to say what would otherwise be an

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
infringing use maybe to make swag with a trademark you can say

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
you know we're granting you a license to make swag go ahead or or very commonly

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
it will be um to have a meet up or sometimes

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
sometimes people allow conferences to someone to

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
come along and create a conference um and you know sort of have an event

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,639
and others will be much more much more um circumspect and when

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,519
they're going to allow someone to do that

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
so these are all choices that can that that should be i believe everybody

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
should have trademark guidelines and that

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
those trademark guidelines can be very clear to set out

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
what the owner believes is a lawful use and what kind of licenses that they

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,839
might be willing to grant so but but this was about you know an

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,959
announcement for an organization so i'm none of this relates really to

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,800
what a trade how how these problems are going to be fixed by a

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,440
trademark holding company but anyway um the next question should trademarks

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,440
be available in a free and fair way so this this i just found the most

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,199
interesting question that you know the quotes on on free and fair

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,199
um what does that mean what does free and fair mean with

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,279
respect to trademarks so is there or should there be some

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
right to use a mark beyond its lawful use now

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,160
you know we'll get to a minute too to um people who try to

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
overreach but it's just talking about lawful use

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,600
is should someone get to use a mark

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,480
in a way that's not only lawful but more than what you know that some some use

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
that the trademark owner might otherwise want to tolerate

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
i frame it this way is should someone other than the project be allowed to

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,920
exploit the marketing value of the mark that's what we're talking about here

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
we're talking about the public-facing use of a trademark

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,160
and should that be allowed even when they have modified the software

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,440
and modified it perhaps even beyond what the project

00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,800
would consider authentic code so it's you know most products

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
would not want their do not want their product altered

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
um of course we live in a world where that's what happens in this

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,440
in this world but at what point is it appropriate for the for the

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,199
trademark owner to say but you can you can't call it that

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
anymore you can't you can change the code but you can't

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
call it you know foo anymore i don't

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,399
i don't have any answers for that question and i would love to have that

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,920
discussion with some people i mean it should should everybody be

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
able should you be able to advertise um that you're using you know putting on

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,560
your web page this is built on you know built on linux there's an

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,600
advert there's a marketing value to saying that

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,839
is who should accrue the value of that should it be linux who does that who

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
gets that or should it be the product that's built on linux

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,399
is there should they get a free ride on that because it's an open source project

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,079
i don't know i think that's i think that's to me that's sort of the next gen

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,600
question on this but again you know again i'm not sure

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,320
how a trademark holding company is is the you know is the

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,920
gonna i don't think trademark ownership necessarily answers these questions

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,920
and then finally we got to our trademarks of open source projects used

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,800
in ways contrary to the open source definition

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,920
and some will try um so you know the failure to grant a

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,800
trademark license per se is not contrary to the osd

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,079
many open source licenses expressly

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,519
state that there that no trademark license is granted

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
and those are routinely approved there are many open source licenses

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,240
um as i said before this bullet point made it on two slides i thought it was

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,120
so important it's a delicately balanced system with

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
rules with rules for what you may or may not use

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,399
when you may or may not use other straight marks but what about those who

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,560
overextend their trademark rights so they claim so

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,000
they have said for example that you may not use their trademark in a way that

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,959
would be lawful that's not a trademark infringement for you to use it that way

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
so that claim if it's not an infringement the only way they can

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,160
enforce that right is under contract law if somehow you

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,120
have agreed with them that you will not do that so why do you

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,520
have to listen to them so where are these found these are found

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
in trademark guidelines are those enforceable contracts

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,160
um i take the position that they aren't i never

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
i take the position that they that they likely would not be considered an

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,320
enforceable contract to have a contract you have to have

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,240
mutual assent i have to be able to point to something that says this is where you

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
agreed that you were going to abide by this

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
restriction and you know having a web page having

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,280
something on a web page you can't prove that i saw the web page

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,160
i didn't click a box it said that i agreed to the web page

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,799
so um you know you're not you're you you may not have um it has a

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
sort of a fundamental problem that they can't prove that you agree to that and

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,120
otherwise your use is lawful so that there's no claim

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,600
if they if they do say for example though that they said well

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,320
you get to use their software uh under the copyright license and in

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,720
addition you have to agree you know your your

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
use of the software is conditioned your copyright license is conditioned on also

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,799
agreeing to our trademark license or to our trademark guidelines

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,720
that would certainly be under the gpl that would be an additional restriction

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,799
um that would not be accepted as a as a further you know further

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,240
restriction under the gpl depending on what was in those

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
guidelines uh would not you know to the extent that

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,200
those guidelines are inconsistent with the osd

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
then you know that combination would be considered

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
contrary to the osd for example that restriction was

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,039
um but you know you can use the software but under the

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,760
trademark license but our trademark license says that

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,480
you're not allowed to commercialize the software well you know that's you can't

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,720
back door into the you know open source

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
software by adding an additional restriction but in

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,400
a different way so again it's just not these are

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
attempts to sort of hack restrictions using trademark law

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,760
but using it in an inappropriate way but you know still not sure what that

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
what what an organization how an organization is

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,280
going to solve this problem um so at the end of the day my opinion

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,400
is that a project may benefit from aligning

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
with a formally organized entity but an entity owning the trademark only

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
the trademark of nothing else is a higher risk type of entity

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,720
in terms of trademark ownership so those are i think those are something that

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
you have to consider when you're looking you're looking at these different

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
entities to see what they may have to offer

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,760
uh i believe that every every open source project

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,200
and every trademark policy should state expressly

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,320
that all lawful uses of the trademark are allowed

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,200
um i think that solves that sells about 95 of the problems right there

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
and then you you know get into an argument over what's lawful but that's

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
sort of the fringe cases and then every project should have the

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
freedom to determine for itself what uses requiring a license it will

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,799
allow so i don't i'm very wary of sort of

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,559
a one-size-fits-all you know trademark trademark

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,280
you know dictate that tries to solve all the problems i think these are

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,480
much more granular issues that each project

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,840
has to has to think about for themselves on what they want to do

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,240
so discussion we'll take a look at the questions that you have in the chat

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,000
also i have a couple slides of resources here

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
if you're interested in those we'll be able to distribute the slides

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,000
but we'll go live now it's great to see everybody thanks everybody for joining

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,240
this is a really fun exercise for me and i hope you also enjoyed it

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,000
so uh first i'm just going to answer one of the questions

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,440
in the shared notes which was which is a question is what

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,520
does control mean um yeah you so i've carefully avoided

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
talking about that it's a it's kind of a bigger question

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,960
and it's and it's very context specific so for example if i um if the

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
trademark message is i created this product then the message

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
the expect the control that you have to exert is

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
you you know you decided what that product was what what

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,480
qualities it has what manufacturing standards it has that can be a very high

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
level of sort of input a decision-making

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,440
on um on you know what the product is going to be

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
or how it's going to come out of the service

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,600
on the other end of the spectrum excuse me on the other end of the

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,760
spectrum you know if you produce if you produce

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,919
if you order mugs from a vendor to hand out

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,400
at a conference in theory if you you know for your trademark

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
you could have a trademark on mugs but and but your

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,600
the control of the mark might be limited to do just selecting a good vendor for

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,919
the mugs you selected somewhat reputable it this

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,080
so when these cases come up about who is

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,480
controlling the mark there um i actually have an article a

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,159
whole article just on that on that topic um there are a lot of

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,799
factors that that courts will consider and look at

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,640
there's a there's about seven or eight factors they look at so control is

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,440
kind of it's the shortcut term for it but it's a little more expansive than

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,919
that and it can range from very you know very very high degree of

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,200
responsibility to you know lower degree depending on

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,159
what the product is and the second the second question

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,360
examples of specific projects that have over extensions on their tried my

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,559
trademark guidelines i um i none come off the top of my head i would have to

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,320
sort of look into it and there might be some people in

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,400
the in the room who have some knowledge i know people have given me examples

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,520
and but i just i don't want to make that accusation without having looked up

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,360
the trademark guideline itself to see whether or not i think it's an overreach

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,520
but i certainly have seen the overreach in trademark guidelines

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,640
can control be delegated and then revoked like from a project to a legal

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,000
entity but then taken back um yeah i guess i'm kind of it's

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,320
that question is not framed in a way that either my brain works or the law

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,640
works so i'm kind of going to going to reframe it

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,840
a little bit what happens is it the courts look at it

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,120
as a moment in time so i have a trademark i'm asserting my

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,400
trademark rights the defendant comes along and challenges it and says no

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
you're not the owner because because you're not controlling the mark

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
so so the case law is sort of a snapshot in time

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,240
it isn't a question of it isn't a question of sort of paper

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,799
or you know agreements it's a question of who's doing the work who's doing the

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,640
heavy lifting on this one thing there's also

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
i also just want to make sure that they're sort of not

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,400
i don't want to i don't know if there might be some sort of

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,960
confusion or blurriness control versus testing so

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
control is i've set up the test parameters

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
say say we have a testing model for control that you get to call it that if

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
you you know the java model you get to use the java trademark if you

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,159
pass the tck they you know java use

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,640
they you self-certify i mean so so people self-certify i believe under

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
under java they self-certify that they pass the test

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,360
um but nevertheless um oracle would still own the trademark because they're

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,480
the ones who set up the testing parameters there's the ones who say

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,559
this is what the project this is what the software has to be able to do

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,080
in order for you to call it java so i don't want to i don't want to

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,640
confuse um a testing or a certification program

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,960
with control of the trademark those you know you could outsource

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
the certification to someone else and say you know

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
you get to you know go to this person they'll certify you know they'll test

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
your software if it passes then you get to use the

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
trademark so you know so that's but that's but it's

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,520
still you know the it's still the software you know there's

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:46,204
the control the decision on what makes that software able to to have that name is still in the different entity

00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:50,159
so i hope that i hope that clarified question three

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,080
and if not i'd be happy to take another stab

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,880
how do how does how do cross-jurisdiction rules apply here

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,360
perhaps to the control in the bulk of that thing i'm not sure what the bulk

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,799
what the bulk means and also as i said this is

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,400
as i said at the outset this is this is very us-specific

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,400
in other countries other countries and i don't want to speak too much about

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,640
other countries because i'm not lawyers in other countries but in some

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,880
countries of registration there are two basic schemes for

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,360
trademark registration the one i described in the us

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,240
which is based on use where the registration is a recognition of already

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,919
use-based rights or you know yeah use space rights other countries

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,480
the registration is the legal grant of the right to use a trademark so two very

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,679
different schemes so in those in those in those jurisdictions where

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,720
the owning a trademark registration is a legal grant

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,080
they're going to look at this question of ownership quite quite differently

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,400
from how we would look at it in in other countries that said

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,080
there are nevertheless i have seen cases for example in the eu

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,200
which is a you know registration based system where

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
nev well it's kind of a i stated like two

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
two different things it's actually just a continuum so

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,640
they get all kind of mushed together and blurry between the country so in the eu

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,320
it is a registration-based system but they also give some deference to

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,520
um non-registered prior rights in certain cases

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,799
and i have seen challenges under eu law on

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,640
whether or not it was the rightful person who registered the trademark so

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,080
you can church you may be able to challenge ownership

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,799
i'm not sure how much the control plays in other countries but that's but

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
it is you know the concept i'm talking about

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,240
is very it is u.s specific

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,399
and so i don't want to speculate on what other countries might say

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,320
um let's see and let's see perhaps the country yeah legal

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,039
systems are different yeah so i if i have not answered question four

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,720
to what you believe is my full ability to answer your question

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,320
for then please type some other questions be happy to

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
oh does wipo does wipo have impact here so um

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,039
trademark kind of yes and yes and no depending on what what you mean by wipo

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,679
so wipo um is a is an ngo

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,520
that administers a number of trademark treaties and so

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,559
so trademarks are territorial for the most part they're

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,640
they're they're every every country has its own trademark laws there

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
are however also a number of trademark treaties that

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,320
do harmonize some aspects of trademark law around the

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,080
world for those um for those uh those countries that

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,840
have signed on to the treaty um i don't actually believe that this

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,039
i'm not i have not i can't think of any way that

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,120
any of those treaties um that there's any kind of universal

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,240
requirement about trademark ownership vis-a-vis

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
control in any of those treaties yes thanks

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,399
everybody it was really great i was so glad to

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,520
so glad to see everybody i wish we could see each other in person but

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,540
