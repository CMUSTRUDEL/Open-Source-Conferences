Title: State of the Source 2020: How Open Source in Public Administrations and Government is different
Publication date: 2020-09-23
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	How Open Source in Public Administrations and Government is Different
Boris van Hoytema 

Collaboration is not intrinsic to public administration. Use of open source software (OSS) is well established in the private sector. How can we help public organizations, renowned for their rigidity, and innately innovation averse, to embrace OSS? We will explain how doing OSS in public administrations is different by diving into public sector structures, incentives and culture. We will show how the Foundation for Public Code is helping public organizations collaborate on and build OSS.

so hello there open source people and um

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,840
especially you welcome to my home office uh here in the lovely amsterdam um

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,240
i am Boris van Hoytema and i'm the secretary and chief executive

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,279
at the Foundation for Public Code we're a non-profit member owned

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,720
organization that has its mission to enable public purpose

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
software that is open and collaborative and of course open source is core to

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,360
this in this talk i would like to give some

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
insights that i think are valuable for the entire open source

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,960
community to have in order to enable public organizations

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
like governments public administrations and state-owned

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,199
enterprises to participate in open source and in our community as

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
commons management organizations and as infrastructure professionals they

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
seem to have obvious benefits that public

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
administrations and public organizations can

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,520
add to our ecosystem they really add meaningful diversity

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,280
they have a lot to bring us so in this talk i want to talk a bit about

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,840
first the advantages for public organizations

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,040
of using and contributing to open source why it is not happening what you can do

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
and what we do at the Foundation for Public Code

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,840
open source would be great for public

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,040
organizations and you probably already know this and

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
as someone from the open source world you might even have some strong feelings

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,119
about it and yes there's a lot that open source

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,960
can give public organizations

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
public organizations don't have a lot of the problems that

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
cause companies too often don't not do open source

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,240
and some of the benefits seem to fit them even better than any other

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
organization like a for-profit corporation

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
startups non-profits or even individuals so

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,039
what do public organizations stand to gain from using and contributing to open

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
source for their most important processes

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
well three major things and i want to start off with the first

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,920
control because a public organization always has full responsibility for the

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
work they do and the services they provide

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,000
our public administrations cannot say well our vendor botched a job so now you

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
won't get your social security or our contracted vendor can't prioritize

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,120
research restoring services to the emergency number so

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,319
everyone please hold on uh no emergencies right now

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
and it can't happen that legislation passes to enable residents to get

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,720
certain rights to services that then cannot be

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,920
provisioned because someone refuses to connect to databases

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,280
if the people democratically decide things need to change

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
they sometimes need to regardless of what contracts have been signed in the

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
past as public organizations are 100 percent

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,440
on the hook this means that a large degree of control over the processes and

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
the underlying infrastructure is needed open source can really enable this kind

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
of control it can enable public organizations to work with

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,599
a wide variety of vendors whilst retaining the ability to lift up

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,360
the hood and make the changes in themselves

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,720
secondly, tying into that a bit is less risk using and contributing to open source

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
software takes away a lot of the risks associated with

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
digital transformation not being the only user of a piece of

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,799
software or process means that if any of the users finds a

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
problem they can fix it for the entire community

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,840
and working in a community means the ability to have professional

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
collaborations for example with people inside your own

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
organization and i've seen this happen a lot where open source and public

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,439
administration's main first visible benefit is that

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
actual internal collaboration gets kicked up to

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,680
a higher level as well as collaborating with other

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
public organizations and various software vendors as well as

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,800
sometimes even residents so this professional

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
community means that projects are more sustainable

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
and that it's easier to recruit new public technologies as well

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,120
in addition to this it's been shown that using and contributing to open source

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,759
leads to better more maintainable and more secure

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,160
digital services open source also takes away a lot of the

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,919
legal issues and the risks around the software

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
on the more public organizations specific level there's another thing

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,080
which is that most governments have laws that specify

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,160
that policy should be public and that information pertaining to any decision

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
that is made about you can be requested in some countries all

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,960
source code used by public organizations is even explicitly called out as being

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,320
requestable or needing to be public working in open source can make those

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,919
processes a lot easier and increase accountability by putting

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,000
it in the foreground and preventing asset surprises later on

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
for instance having to go through a whole bunch of source code which

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
was never meant to be published it has a whole bunch of problems in it

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,120
and specifics and details intermingled with keys and secrets

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,160
that will then be really hard later on to publish

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
open source de-risks digital infrastructure on all levels and this is

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,919
seriously needed for the infrastructure that runs our

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
societies and the third advantage that i want to

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,520
talk about is a larger effectivity in the end public organizations need to

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,160
deliver services these services need to be good and they

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
need to experi be experienced well by all residents and all local

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
businesses in addition it seems that the

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,520
expectation for the cost of these services

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,240
is always that it must be run for next to nothing

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,560
open source enables participants to benefit from collective innovations

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
making it easier to deliver modern services for less

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
nobody competes and who has the best database architecture for social

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
services who can fix street lighting the quickest

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
or where their citizens can apply to a parking permit

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,639
so everyone can benefit from sharing the underlying technologies

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,400
and so this seems all clear-cut so why isn't open source in public

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,120
administrations commonplace it would be great for

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,080
all of our public digital infrastructure to be running an open source

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,199
and it would be great for all of our public organizations to actively

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,520
participate in open source communities as well

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,720
in addition to that it would be great to have them contribute

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
to the ecosystem to add their specific flavor

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,199
and have their role in the maintainance of pieces of the

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
software they rely on

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
they can contribute some of their unique abilities to new open source

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,520
projects as well after all they add a dynamic that is different

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,960
from the individual corporate or non-profit contributors

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
that we see now and can bring new and diverse strengths

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
to all of our projects but it's not that simple and it won't

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,479
just happen because it's a good idea for public

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,759
organizations to become participants in the ecosystem well

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,120
they first of all need to change themselves however

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,599
the rest of our community can also do a lot to facilitate this transition

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,080
and for that i would like to highlight some of the dynamics and problems

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
with public organizations adopting open source

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,319
of course a commonly cited point is that public organizations and public workers

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,720
are conservative and that is definitely true partly

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,759
because their work is so important and partly in order to provide stability

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,160
in organizations where the leadership changes every few years

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
so some causes for this for the private sector

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,000
such as in companies non-profits or with individuals failure is generally

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,159
quickly forgotten and successes are greatly celebrated

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,839
whilst in public organizations this is the other way around

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
successes as cena are seen as their default and thus

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,959
go unnoticed whilst failure often goes severely punished

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,240
in addition to this public organizations are bound to treat

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,839
everyone equally which of course corporations do not

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
so this means that change is difficult and innovation is

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,399
hard few get fired for walking on the tested path

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,160
even if they know it might be the wrong one and the result

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,680
is that even if all politicians and all the managers in the

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,320
organization agree open sources the way forward this might not happen

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
this can be seen for example in organizations that have politically

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
decided to go for open source and have invested a lot of the technical

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
know-how that's necessary for that but still end up buying proprietary

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,519
solutions as an example i've seen procurement

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
staff rather use a procurement process they know well

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,200
even if they know it has problems then use a new framework for open source

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,480
procurement that they don't really know or they might not get the legal go ahead

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
because the legal team doesn't understand some of the intricacies of

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
open source or doesn't understand how competition or

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,440
state support legislation applies to it even if it's understood that not doing

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,600
open source costs a lot more money both procuring open source software for

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
public organizations as well as selling to them is extra hard

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,680
and that brings us to our next problem public organizations are used to buying

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
software as a product akin to staplers park benches

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,279
or coffee and for some of the software

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,120
they that they operate this might be sufficient however

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
since they have responsibilities that i talked about before

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,640
for a lot of the software they buy this is problematic

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,399
because some of that software is maybe more of a process

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,519
than it is a product software that runs the processes and executes the policies

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,760
of public administrations aren't purchasable in the same way

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
as normal software and sometimes this software is even being closer to

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,640
being a law than being a stapler another problem that raises here is

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,120
how innovation is paid for and who takes on that risk the current

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,880
proprietary software procurement model is really based on the assumption that

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,279
a vendor takes on the risks and takes on the investments

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,600
on the assumption then that when they do make something work and they make

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
something which they can sell multiple times and they make something custom for

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,000
you that they can sell to a larger group that they also get

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,880
the benefits this creates an ecosystem in which the vendors

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,760
take all the risk and are expected to extract as much value as they can

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,240
whenever they succeed and this has led to a lot of distrust

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
and significantly soured the relationship between public

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
organizations and market parties a working

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,680
open source ecosystem works around adding value around code bases

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
versus extracting it so buying hours of work

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
or service agreements becomes more commonplace instead

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,680
of buying licenses open source instead of unlocking and thus more of

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
the risk of investment needs to be taken on by public organizations

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,240
public organizations need to invest in open source development communities

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,600
its members and its future members which is our next problem

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,360
public organizations operate on a mandate to serve their own constituents

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
a city a water board a province state sheriff's department or a nation

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,360
serves its residents and taxpayers having this mandate means allocating

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
resources for developing communities around code bases

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,720
is often not possible doing something that mainly benefits

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
another organization somewhere else is seen as politically

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
not acceptable even if there are significant advantages

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,519
investing in a community is often just flat out not allowed

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,000
i've seen this often and i've even seen and this is fairly common

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,880
that reviewing incoming bug reports or pull requests from other organizations

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
that are using your source code is often not

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
allowed and this plays into the isolative nature

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,160
of public organizations they often operate on their own whilst

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
working within the framework of a higher government

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,240
they have their own processes and the jargon that comes with it

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279
and often they believe they are the only one in the world

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,800
doing what they're doing this gets exa gets shown by there being more than 500

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
different definitions of the term public administrations

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,320
used by public administrations in north america alone

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
so coupled with a mandate problem this makes it really hard to develop

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,399
solutions that are generic enough for others to understand let alone use

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,800
so these are a few of the main problems that we have and i see these everywhere

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,320
however your local public organizations

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,920
will have their own issues and you might be able to help with it

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,720
so what can you do well first of all it will be in all of our

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,680
benefits if you support public organizations

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,440
in their transitions towards more open source

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
we have a lot of the technical know-how and this can benefit your local

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,480
regional or national public organizations

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,320
and of course all of those people will love your input

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,720
however also be met we also expect to be met with some distrust

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
as i said before the relationship between public organizations and market

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,880
parties has often become a bit difficult and thus even with good intentions

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,240
public organizations are often very afraid of being had

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
or being pushed into something that might not be good for them in the long run

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,079
 

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,600
be honest and open with them clearly explain business models and stakeholder

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,880
relations and how they work in open source

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,440
this can be difficult for organizations that are so used to hyper hierarchical

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,000
governance and think management is about being

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,959
completely in control of everything of course it doesn't work like that in

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,560
open source and you can tell them be patient with it as most civil workers

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
do what they do because they are passionate about

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,800
helping society their responsibilities can make them

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
stubborn at times but they're often really willing to improve

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
in my experience people in public

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
organizations want to make sure that things are sustainable in the long

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,560
term meaning that they can work with

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
you in order to figure out what business models you need

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,360
in order for the entire ecosystem to be sustainable

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,720
so what do we add to this mix and what do we do with the foundation for

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,680
public code well we started a bit more than a year

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,880
ago and we're trying to figure out how to enable

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,120
this ecosystem for now we're primarily focused on

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
showing that public organization open source projects can be mature

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,320
multi-stakeholder community driven projects which both

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,440
publicly and private parties involved we do this through a set of processes

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,240
that we call code based stewardship which we've in true open source fashion

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,160
mostly stolen from other open source foundations and adapted for use in the

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,800
public organization space in codebase stewardship we provide code

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,520
bases with the coaching guidance and oversight to become mature

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,720
although sometimes it feels a bit more like relationship therapy

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,400
we do this in roughly four domains

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,839
one community to help people come together and govern their assets and

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,720
interactions two quality to help the community work

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,679
on a shared level of quality and speak one language three product marketing

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,000
to help the community grow attract new users and contributors

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,520
four to connect the community and the questions and answers within

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,280
this is all in heavy development and we're stewarding at a

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
handful of code bases to maturity working with the public organizations

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:51,120
and vendors market parties involved something that would provo something

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,799
that we've produced in this process is the standard for public code which is

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,240
kind of our quality level for what we believe a

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,720
mature public organization open source code base should at least be

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,360
it has the quality criteria and guidance for policy makers managers

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,080
as well as designers and developers as we believe that developing great open

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
source requires involvement from all these

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,039
multiple stakeholders we hope that this standard can make it

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,919
easier for actors in the ecosystem to speak

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,720
each other's language and trust each other as they work together

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,559
this is still with version 0.1.4 and it's oh it's very young

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,080
and we're now trying to put it into practice into multiple real world

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
scenarios to test its real world applicabilities

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
there are also a few community projects that have adopted the standard

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,840
separately from us and together with this community we're

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,080
working to make a great standard of course this is also something where

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,120
we would really appreciate your input since you probably have a lot of the

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,280
knowledge that we are missing and we're welcoming

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,880
your issues and pull requests on standard.public.com.net and our

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,799
community calls so i'm going to leave it at that and i

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,440
want to thank you for sitting through this talk

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,280
and the open source initiative for the great work they do putting on this event

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,160
but also of course maintaining the open source definition

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,400
and the marketing around open source please feel free to use whatever you

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,679
call you can find on our website or from this

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
presentation everything we make is mostly published

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,520
in the public domain as we really hope to kickstart a mature practice

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,840
of public organization open source and invite everyone to join us and in

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,240
building this

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,440
it really was really endemic of sort of the space uh of public

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,640
public open source uh often it is not the the the the dedication of the or the

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,240
passion of the people involved that stop open source from from really

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
being successful in the public administration

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,640
but really often it's also rules and guidelines and someone in the process

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,000
who isn't able to to really um step out of their comfort

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,559
zone to look out of the rule set that they know and and try to do something

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,039
else the first question is how global is the

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,679
coverage of publiccode.net again um and where are the most of the

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,240
organizations that you've been working with

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,480
um so we were founded in amsterdam my previous job was to work

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
with uh with the municipality of amsterdam

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,200
and um that is visible in sort of our practice

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,640
as well we work a lot with dutch organizations

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,159
we work less with european organizations we work

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,960
with some organizations in in spain

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,159
in italy in france in denmark and we've tried doing some things with

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,640
with american mostly municipalities and counties

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
but all of that doesn't doesn't go by itself um

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
we have looked at this space though and one of the things that we realized

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,520
is that there are quite a lot of great open source initiatives in in a lot of

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,640
different countries but they often get stuck at the country

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,679
level because civil servants are often very much

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,760
people that think inside of their own sort of like legal framework

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,159
and thus find it really hard to to collaborate across borders

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,400
and in that we have very explicitly made the decision that

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
we say well if you want to do open source software development

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
even in a local government context you should for instance

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,919
use english in your development it will be more natural for most of the

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
developers involved but it will also mean that your code

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,080
base will have the ability to scale to a larger scale at one point and that

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,520
scale is really where the advantage of open source for a lot of public

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,799
administrations comes in so we have those ambitions of course

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,880
public administrations public organizations are slow and conservative

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
so all this doesn't go that fast

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,039
all right um and if like i haven't answered enough of your question

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,080
feel free to put more questions into the shared notes

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,280
um so where could we specifically contribute to github

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,960
uh on github so this uh the standard for public code

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,919
um it can be contributed to by going to github.com/publiccodenet/standard

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,039
or you can go to standard.publiccode.net

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,280
and you can figure out how to contribute there

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,240
we uh also all of our all of our knowledge

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,480
uh most of our documentation is somewhere around there in that github

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,480
organization as well and uh yeah we'd love to have you

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,880
involved of course um so

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,120
could we share the links with us here so uh i see that one of these links has

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,919
already come into the chat um are there more other specific chat

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,159
links that you want shared then i'll i can add them

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
to the moderator can you download the chat

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,080
the notes are being downloaded for all sessions so i'm i'm guessing they'll be

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,559
available somewhere and also anyone who would like to speak

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,919
can unmute themselves with this uh that audio button in the button and they

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,840
can they can bring in some some things

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,799
no more questions so i've completely saturated all of your

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
your needs for information i think maybe we should we

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,279
should keep it at that then so uh there was one comment that um

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,320
that there were good points made about local and municipal organizations it

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,559
helps explain why a national policy preference for

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
foss use didn't always translate into action

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
debbie says she's going to pitch a talk to the national association of counties

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,559
on the value of open source for their digital series

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:12,159
do it debbie also that like if you want any help maybe my talk today

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
wasn't representative enough but we have more smart people on our team and that

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,480
can they can help with anyone and we always

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
love to to help think with these kind of things

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
our mission is really to enable that um public software that is open and

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,960
collaborative across the world and and i think we also learn a lot from

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
collaborating with others on helping our collective ideas improve

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
um so we're we're with this offering some

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,200
like free help you think about anything and anyone can contact me directly

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,880
boris at publiccode.net and i would love to to think with you about that

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,039
boris there's a question asking if there's any public code contacts in the uk

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,320
are there any public code i think i think that's maybe a good one to uh

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,240
to talk over email on because i think that

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
i'd be interested in like what you're trying to achieve and then there

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,120
there are many people that have are doing interesting things

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,660
