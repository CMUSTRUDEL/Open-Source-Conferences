Description: 
	How Open Source in Public Administrations and Government is Different
Boris van Hoytema 

Collaboration is not intrinsic to public administration. Use of open source software (OSS) is well established in the private sector. How can we help public organizations, renowned for their rigidity, and innately innovation averse, to embrace OSS? We will explain how doing OSS in public administrations is different by diving into public sector structures, incentives and culture. We will show how the Foundation for Public Code is helping public organizations collaborate on and build OSS.
