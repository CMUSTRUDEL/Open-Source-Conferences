Description: 
	Keynote: An Open Source Success at Sea
Joshua Simmons | President at Open Source Initiative

This is an interesting moment for open source, and for OSI. Open source continues to be overwhelmingly successful, but it is being tested, and it is losing hearts and minds while the community wonders: who is at the wheel? First, in this talk, we'll try to make sense of the state of play around open source licensing. Then, we'll talk about how we can make ours a more coherent, reliable, and representative ecosystem. Together, we will make ours a commons for posterity, one that lifts people up, one built to last.
