Title: State of the Source 2020: Keynote: An Open Source Success at Sea, Joshua Simmons
Publication date: 2020-09-11
Playlist: State of the Source Summit 2020
Description: 
	Keynote: An Open Source Success at Sea
Joshua Simmons | President at Open Source Initiative

This is an interesting moment for open source, and for OSI. Open source continues to be overwhelmingly successful, but it is being tested, and it is losing hearts and minds while the community wonders: who is at the wheel? First, in this talk, we'll try to make sense of the state of play around open source licensing. Then, we'll talk about how we can make ours a more coherent, reliable, and representative ecosystem. Together, we will make ours a commons for posterity, one that lifts people up, one built to last.

today is this this is an interesting

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,760
moment for open source

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,320
and for osi it's no secret that open

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
source

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,440
has gone from fringe to mainstream

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
it's fanned the flames of open culture

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
movements

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,800
it's empowered students hobbyists

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
journalists humanitarians

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,280
activists and entrepreneurs

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,680
industrialists too

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,320
today open source is being tested

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,559
as it always has been but on a grand

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
scale

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,760
and while it continues to grow overall

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,159
it's

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,560
losing hearts and minds questions dog us

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
setting aside run-of-the-mill fear

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
uncertainty and doubt

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
people are raising legitimate questions

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,240
are our projects sustainable

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,680
are our communities safe and healthy are

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,439
our maintainers being treated fairly

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,960
is our work just and can open source

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,680
weather continued attempts at

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
redefinition

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
these concerns are not new but the scale

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,759
they're playing out on

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,759
is an open source initiative

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,320
though it has sustained its core mission

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,399
around licensing for 22 years

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
slogging through the legal janitorial

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
work that makes open source adoption

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
easy

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,799
osi has not been a leading voice in

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,640
these other conversations

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
even on the topic of licensing

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,320
occasionally osi has been found on its

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,399
back foot

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,479
there is a lot going on

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
the title of this talk is an open source

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,360
success at sea

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,640
which though a bit melodramatic maybe

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
captures the mood of the moment

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,200
i'm going to try to cut through the

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,400
miasma we're going to talk through a few

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
mental models

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
examine osi's role and explore one

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,560
possible future

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,800
my goal here today is to ground us

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
together in a shared narrative

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,800
before i start i want to tell you my own

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
narrative

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,160
i want to share a little about myself so

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,160
that you get where i'm coming from

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640
i am a community organizer and

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,560
a web developer by trade which i've

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
parlayed into working in open source

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
strategy

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,840
first at o'reilly media then at google

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,360
now at salesforce i'm a dedicated

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,440
advocate of open culture

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
inclusive community building and ethical

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,840
technology

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
and i have a really bad habit of

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
volunteering for things

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,640
my career kicked off as a freelance web

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,959
developer in which i was selling drupal

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
and wordpress websites

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
i used and benefited from free and open

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,360
source software

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
gosh it had to have been for about 18

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
years before i even

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
realized that something special was

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,599
happening

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,680
like many i took it for granted

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,480
both as a consumer and as a creator

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,280
but in 2013 when i first encountered the

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
free software

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,720
movement when i discovered the

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,799
philosophies behind open source

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,959
i was ecstatic when i met the people

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,200
and communities that made it all happen

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,560
i fell in love

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,200
mostly we we have a little work to do

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
because i've long had an intuitive love

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,040
of the comments

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,000
uh distaste for intellectual property

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
systems twisted by special interests

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,439
and the natural tendency to get involved

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,560
with communities

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,439
working and volunteering in foss

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,320
it's it's at the intersection of so many

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,320
things that i love

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,840
so in 2013 i dove in head first

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,919
and though i ran for the drupal

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,240
association board of directors that year

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,199
and

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,199
was unsuccessful i was broadly welcomed

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,080
with open arms

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
three years later i'd make my first run

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,800
for the open source initiative board of

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,240
directors

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
and i would go on to win

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
i've run for office twice more since

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320
then

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
and every time my platform is much the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,639
same

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
i run on a platform of expanding access

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
in the open ethos

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,320
of diversity and inclusion bringing new

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
people into our communities

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,080
and mentoring the next generation of

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
leaders

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
i run on a platform of putting osi on

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,680
stronger footing

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,039
making it a more bold and responsive

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,360
organization today

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,880
and tomorrow and i lead with a steadfast

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
commitment to embracing challenging

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,720
conversations

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,320
over the last four years i've been osi's

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
chief financial officer

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
its vice president and the chair of the

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,039
staffing committee

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,280
endeavoring always to build bridges into

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,160
software freedom into corporate open

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,360
source

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,120
and between cultural divides

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,160
now i have the great honor

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
and privilege

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,880
and responsibility of presiding over osi

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,880
as its president

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
though after only seven years

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,440
consciously in this field

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,160
sometimes it's a bit strange i'm

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,400
surrounded by people who have been here

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,080
far longer than i have

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,680
and to be frank it's a regular source of

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
self-doubt

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
but i've learned to appreciate it for

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
the asset that it is

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,160
because that means that i come to the

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,360
table with perspective fresh perspective

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,039
and humility and that

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,880
that's been useful

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,319
now that you know a little bit about

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,600
where i'm coming from

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
i'd like to share with you some of the

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
mental models that i use

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,520
that i've cobbled together to make sense

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,600
of the world

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
first let's start with unpacking open

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
source

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,240
there are many meanings of open source

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
and i view the most commonly understood

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
meanings

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,280
in layers at the bottom

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,280
we have the foundation open source the

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
open source definition itself

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,800
a 10-point definition used to judge

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
whether a license qualifies to be

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,479
described as

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,479
open source

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,360
sometimes i think we maybe spend too

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
much time thinking about licensing

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,160
but it is the cornerstone on which the

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
entire facade of software

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
modern software development rests open

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
source licensing

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,680
enables all the other aspects of open

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,919
source that we love

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,370
on top of the open source definition we

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
have open collaboration

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,520
[Music]

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
sure the source code is openly licensed

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
but

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,039
will you accept my pull request can i

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,800
contribute new features

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,880
or is this really just a vendor-driven

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,000
project with an open source license

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,919
that's okay but let's just be honest

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,479
about these things

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,080
lastly the top open source licensing and

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,120
open source collaboration

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,960
we have open governess

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,879
okay so the source code is openly

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
licensed you'll even accept my pull

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
requests

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
but can i influence the direction of the

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,560
project

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
are there safeguards against the project

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
being re-licensed

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,120
without community consent

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,080
together these make up the core of what

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,720
people understand as open source

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,599
there's also a broader spirit of open

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
source

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,199
but that's more personal and if you ask

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,120
five people

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,879
but the spirit of open source is you

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
will get six different answers

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,479
speaking of asking five people and

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,599
getting six different answers

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,440
while i won't attempt to define the

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,360
spirit of open source

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
i do think it's useful to acknowledge

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
some of the many

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,479
many narratives out there about open

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,360
source

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
how you think about open source is no

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
surprise

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,320
uh dependent on what your relationship

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
to open source is

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,040
among the narratives is a free software

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,760
center narrative

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,720
software freedom is a moral movement and

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,240
open source is about business

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,640
an author centered narrative

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
maintainers are exploited and deserve

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
more support

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,720
and maybe we should consider new

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,600
licenses to make sure they get paid

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,480
a user-centered narrative vanishingly

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
few people

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,720
have had the promise of user freedom

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,560
realized for them there are narratives

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
that claim software freedom and open

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
source

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,320
are libertarian ideals that are unfit

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,920
for the world we live in

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
and there are narratives that suggest

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,800
that software freedom in open source can

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
be viewed through more socialism

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,839
communitarian lenses

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
there are narratives from people out

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,760
there doing the work

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,720
to educate every last human being on

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,080
this planet

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
or coordinate crisis response or provide

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,640
accessible self-service infrastructure

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,160
for underserved people

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,360
narratives that suggest you know what

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,120
what we've got is working and i haven't

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
even gotten to the prevailing corporate

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
open source narrative

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
or how a small number of vcs want the

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
marketing cache of open source without

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
the obligations

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,680
or how activists are experimenting with

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
injecting social causes into licenses

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,680
suffice it to say there are a lot of

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
competing

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,959
and complementary narratives about open

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,320
source

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,920
gitti frank there's a little merit

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
to most of them if not

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,880
it's important to try and understand all

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,440
these narratives

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,640
because it helps us to make sense of the

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,959
experiments we see

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,320
in our ecosystem experiments in

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,240
licensing

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,760
in collaboration and in governance

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
this brings me to the last mental model

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,120
that i would like to share with you

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,560
there are three primary motivators that

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,680
drive people to experiment with

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
licensing

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,600
and they are as old as licensing in open

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,880
source itself

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,000
first there's experimentation driven by

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,560
changes in technology for instance

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
we had the gpl and then we had the

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
advent

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,000
of software as a service which

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,600
the gpl didn't quite cover and so we got

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,200
the agpl

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,880
which closed the network loophole

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
we have the cryptographic autonomy

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,800
license more recently

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,839
a license that was written with an eye

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
on data ownership

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
there's experimentation driven by money

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
of course there is

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
there's the shared source initiative

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
source available licenses

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
the business source license things of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
that ilk

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,720
you know we've seen this with redis with

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,360
century with

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
you name it

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,480
and then with experimentation driven by

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,200
moral motivations we have the json

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,279
license

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,399
the vaccine license the hippocratic

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
license

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,839
the json license was not the first moral

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
or ethical license so to speak

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
but it was one of the one of the most

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,440
popular ones early on

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,519
the this software shall not be used for

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
evil license

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,600
the vaccine life license i think the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
names on the tin

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,639
the hippocratic license is a license

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
that is

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,560
injecting human rights applications into

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
the license

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,600
and look i am glad

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,920
people are experimenting i'm sympathetic

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,160
to experiments driven by desire for

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,079
justice

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
the evolution of licenses in the face of

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,959
changing technology

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,000
that seems inevitable and necessary and

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,120
the experimentation

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,040
in pursuit of greater profits is

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,240
well it's understandable if not terribly

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,480
sympathetic or interesting

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
people see needs and they're trying to

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,079
meet them

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,079
that's that's great and

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,600
but only to a point given my jobs you're

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
probably not surprised to learn that i'm

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,639
wary of licensed proliferation

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
but we can have experimentation without

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,279
risking that

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,079
okay i've told you about the moment we

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,480
find ourselves in

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,160
about myself i've shared with you three

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,959
mental models that i use to understand

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,440
the environment we find ourselves in

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,720
now let's talk about why we're here

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,399
today

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,560
why osi is convening state of the source

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,200
why osi even exists in the first place

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,760
osi's mission is to promote and protect

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,760
open source

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
what might that mean

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,560
osi is first and foremost

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,240
a standards body for open source

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
licensing

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,800
derived from the debian free software

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,880
guidelines inspired by the four freedoms

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,680
maintaining the open source definition

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,160
is the heart of this operation

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,199
and while the osd is worthy of scrutiny

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
exploration

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,560
clarification it has ingredients that

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,240
were key to enabling the success of our

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,079
spectacular comments

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
and it is osi's job to mine then

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,440
while the open source definition is our

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
north star

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,399
the osi approved license list is the

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
offering that the world relies on osi

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,480
for

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
and then there's a license review

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,240
process we administer

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,440
the process by which new licenses are

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
vetted and added

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
and considered for addition to the osi

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,639
approved license list

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,880
as well as the license discuss forum

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,160
which we use to clarify the application

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
of the open source definition

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,760
as a standards body providing a standard

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,440
the open source definition

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,519
upon which countless people and

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
organizations rely

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:02,320
there is one essential operation

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,360
that animates all these key ingredients

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,440
is that essential operation convening

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,120
stakeholders

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,480
osi is a vehicle of by and for

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,839
the community from day zero it was about

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,079
bringing people together

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
with different ideas and motivations

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,000
around a stable

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
and shared understanding of open source

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
of a certain way of

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,399
to approach intellectual property that

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
could change the world

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,320
there was never a day

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,199
when everyone agreed about what open

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,279
source meant in totality

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,959
but we've always been able to broadly

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
agree on the open source definition

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,759
this bringing together of stakeholders

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,240
each with their own goals

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,800
in productive exploration of the applica

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,959
and application of open source licensing

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,880
this is osi's core duty and

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
it happens to be where we've fallen down

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,480
most in recent years

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,480
more about that momentarily

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,920
with a sense of what osi

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
at its core does for the community i'd

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
like to take a brief detour

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,000
through its past so that we can

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
understand

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,360
where we're going and we can be ready to

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,480
talk about the future

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,440
now this is

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,800
a reductionist and inevitably incomplete

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,639
view of osi's history

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,320
but here we go founded in 1998

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
the organization was held together in

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
its first decade through stall

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,240
strong board leadership in michael

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,399
tiemann and denise cooper

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
deb bryant carl fogle and mike

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
milinkovic

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,120
and simon phipps helped osi begin

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,680
professionalizing

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,120
by hiring general manager patrick masson

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
in becoming more democratic

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,600
with the introduction of a community

00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,600
elected board

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,440
molly de blanc allison randall stefano

zack

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,559
zakiroli they fostered better ties with

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,720
the free software community

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,679
richard fontana elevated legal

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,520
discussions

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,120
taking osi's licensing work from

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,079
knowledgeable hackers

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,880
to expert practitioners and defining a

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,480
review process

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,400
the present board and staff are still

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,000
busy at work leaving legacies to be

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,959
inherited and described

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,959
by the next generation

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,200
here's another way of looking at osi's

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,559
history

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,400
osi as we know it did not exist

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:45,520
until 2013. from 20 from 1998

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,960
to 2013 it was volunteer driven and

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
operated

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,559
then it introduced board elections took

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,200
on its full first full-time staff member

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,200
in patrick

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,840
from 2013 to 2020 under patrick

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
stewardship

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,440
in concert with leaders like allison

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,400
randall molly de blanc and simon phipps

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,679
osi remained volunteer driven but was

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,600
operated

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,080
was staff operated with volunteer

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,080
support

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,559
over the last seven years osi has

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
sustained its core mission

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,720
shaped policy around the globe worked

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
tirelessly to mitigate open washing

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,640
built an alliance of more than 125

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
organizations representing hundreds of

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
thousands of people provided

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
a home for projects like clearly defined

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,919
and rolled out programs like floss

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,600
desktops for kids

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,200
in the open source technology management

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
courses with brandeis university

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,360
osi has been busy we have seen

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,160
incremental progress every year

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,240
osi has expanded programs and refined

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,960
its operations

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,000
the trouble is our capabilities have not

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,000
kept up with demand

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,480
now it's the time for the next evolution

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
of osi

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,679
two years ago the organization

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
recognized the need

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,559
for the next transformation and began

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,720
laying out a plan for staffing

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,919
in the intervening time we have found

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
ourselves shaving

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,559
a lot of yaks to get to the overarching

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
goal

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,840
we've also discovered that the path

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
forward isn't just about hiring

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,520
it's about building a robust community

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,200
engagement operation

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,200
in refining our governance as well

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,640
that is what osi has been focused on in

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,480
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,640
we are preparing to evolve into an

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
organization that is no longer driven by

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,600
volunteers

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,760
nor so reliant on volunteer labor

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,799
we are preparing to hire an executive

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
director

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,559
who will be supervised by community

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,000
representatives that is to say

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,280
the board and supported by a small

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,039
but mighty staff and we're building a

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,960
community engagement engine right into

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,960
the heart of it

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,320
because like i said osi always was

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,960
always will be of by and for

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
the community

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,360
in 2021 you will see osi hire not only

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,039
an executive director

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,880
but a community manager and a

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,400
communications manager

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,480
because while this is the first state of

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,000
the source

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,320
it can't be the last for too long

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,159
osi has relied on mailing lists and the

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,200
casual privilege of knowing the right

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,919
person to talk to for too long

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,559
osi has been reactive rather than

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,559
proactive

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,720
the community needs a bolder and more

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,120
responsive open source initiative

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
we want to advocate for the community

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,880
maintain

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,600
a level playing field ensure processes

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,360
and levers of influence are documented

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
make every voice heard

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,679
and do so in a way that is both

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
productive and doesn't systematically

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,000
disadvantage

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,960
underrepresented people to do that

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
we're going to need staff capacity

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
alongside staff

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,039
we're also making investments in a new

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,400
code of conduct

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,480
better suited communications

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
infrastructure subtext

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
mailing lists are not the end-all be-all

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,120
of communications

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,960
clearer governance greater transparency

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
and a host of new advisory boards and

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,640
working groups

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
all of these taken together represent

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,559
what could be a radical transformation

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
of osi's role in the community

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,720
responsive to and consistent with the

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,880
war with what the world has demanded of

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
us

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,360
yet while it's a radical transformation

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,200
and capability there is nothing

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,600
particularly radical about the process

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,080
that osi is going through

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,400
it's a natural evolution that all

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,840
healthy non-profits go through

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
albeit at varying speeds

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,600
this vision for osi a world in which the

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,280
organization serves us all by being

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,360
on the leading edge of open source

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
issues and providing a forum for us to

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,559
navigate them

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,080
it's so within reach

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,919
but there's one key that i've failed to

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,520
mention so far

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,679
and that's you you

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,280
stakeholder this constituent that

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
community engagement this that and the

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,600
other

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,600
i am talking about you

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,840
an approach to intellectual property

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,799
that was once seen as radical is now

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,280
mainstream

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,159
in 2011 13 years after open source was

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,159
coined

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
and the open source initiative was

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,760
founded to promote

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,080
and protect it o'reilly media declared

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,440
that open source had won

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,559
in 2016 wired followed suit

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,360
now open source undergirds software

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,320
development

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,280
across a truly unfathomable range of

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
applications

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,799
and fans the flames of other open

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
culture movements

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,159
it has inspired new ways of

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,159
collaborating with each other

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,440
experiments in community governance

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,760
governance

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,520
and has been so successful that it is

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,799
colloquially understood

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,240
to mean all of the above

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,520
this success brings challenges

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,799
new and old on a massive scale

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,280
osi has been given its mandate and we

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,600
know how to make you proud

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,640
as we evolve as we grow

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,679
we need your voice we need your

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
donations

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,919
we need your time and together

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,799
we will make ours a more coherent

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,080
reliable

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,760
and representative movement we

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,240
will make ours a commons for posterity

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,919
one that lifts people up and one that's

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,840
built to last

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,200
we do have some minutes for question and

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
answer

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,240
i'm going to go ahead and allow

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,400
everybody to

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,080
open up their microphones and their

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,120
webcams if they would like

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,039
please be respectful and only have one

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,080
person at a time it doesn't look like we

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,440
have any

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,840
questions in the shared notes so

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,480
i'm gonna go ahead and unlock everybody

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,320
but again

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
please make sure that we

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,840
be respectful of everybody

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,080
while uh we have this dead air i will

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,720
both thank people for being here

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
uh i'm so glad that you're here that we

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,640
can have this conversation together

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,559
this whole event is such an important

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,559
thing for for osi and for the community

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,799
uh i want to remind people that tomorrow

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,679
we have a panel

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,279
with uh with most if not all of the osi

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,559
leadership board and staff

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,360
definitely recommend attending that josh

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,159
it looks like

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,720
someone is typing a question into the

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:33,679
into the shared notes there

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,679
fantastic i want to take a look at that

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,720
oh this is an excellent question

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
question here

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,159
is what would the cost of this operation

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
be moving forward

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,960
how would the financial situation be

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,640
reflective of various stakeholders

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
oh i'm so glad someone's getting done to

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,559
brass tax here

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,279
right now osi operates with a budget of

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,039
about half a million dollars annually

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,960
excuse me the majority of that budget

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,799
is uh is actually earmarked with a

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,559
clearly defined member project

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,120
i think that's about half of our annual

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,880
budget so that means that osi for its

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,159
core operations and programs

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,679
has about 250 000 a year that covers one

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,320
full-time head count

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
um maybe half a dozen or to a dozen

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
vendors

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,799
um and then this the the services and

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,919
infrastructure that help us keep the

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,120
lights on

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,840
so that gives you a sense of what our

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,200
budget looks like now

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,559
our sense is that we're going to have to

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,919
do a lot of fundraising in order to

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,120
support this the staff that we're

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
talking about

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,840
for an executive director we're

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,440
definitely going to need to be able to

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
offer more salary than we offer a

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
general manager

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,400
for a communications manager and

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
community manager those

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
might be able to start as part-time

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,440
roles but we especially

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
with an eye on the community manager

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,960
rule it's going to be best if they're

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
full-time roles

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,559
and so what we're looking at is probably

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,840
uh an increase in our annual budget from

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:02,000
maybe 250 000 a year for coreosi things

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,240
to maybe 600 000 a year

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
yeah that's more than a twofold increase

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,840
um

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,960
but we've gotten a lot of support in the

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,120
last year

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
just as much as people have been calling

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,559
osi in and saying hey

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,000
why aren't you leading this conversation

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,799
why aren't you in the space

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,159
why are you behind on this injustice

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,840
people have been offering that

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,960
that um that that loving uh

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,880
criticism and very valid people have

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,360
also been stepping up to support us

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,080
and we have lots of offers of support

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
should we

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,279
put forward a plan that people can

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,279
believe in

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
that's what this talk was about that's

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,679
what our session about is about

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,520
tomorrow and in the coming months

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
especially as we get closer to higher

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,840
beginning the search to hire an

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,919
executive director

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,279
we will be publishing more of our our

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,279
thinking in our planning

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,520
so that you can have a sense of whether

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,640
you believe we're on the right track

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,159
you can offer us feedback we can course

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,679
correct as needed

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,279
and you can decide if this is an

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,480
investment worth making

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,760
and i hope it is because not only does

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,320
osi need it

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
it is really the only vehicle in the

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,679
community that

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,520
is in osi's position as sort of this

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,320
neutral party that can convene

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,000
so many different types of stakeholders

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,919
so again just in summary

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
uh current annual budget is about half a

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,279
million a year

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
only about half of that 250 thousand

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,080
dollars a year is actually on osi

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,720
expenses the rest is for clearly defined

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,480
we're going to need to increase the core

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,880
budget for about 250 000

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
a year to about 600 000 a year enabled

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,520
to do that

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,200
we expect that most of that will be done

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,159
through corporate sponsorship and

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
uh one-off donations our individual

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,720
members make up about twenty thousand

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,000
dollars

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
of uh revenue a year suffice it to say

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
it would be a very very long road if we

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,039
tried to do that fundraising through

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,120
individuals

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,840
we may also look at grants really

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,840
everything is on the table here

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,240
the next question i see here from jamie

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
clark

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,799
do do i see osi putting out some guides

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,799
or pathfinders into the question

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,559
i want to put some time into osi goals

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,480
where do i go

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,080
where as in go to this committee this

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,159
portal the scope statement

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,600
etc this is another really good question

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,760
and this is one of the things that has

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
been really challenging for osi

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,480
though osi has some official forums for

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,880
people to communicate within

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,640
you know i alluded to to it in the top

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
the osi for a long time has

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,600
relied on sort of the casual privilege

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,640
of knowing the right person

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,360
um is anybody who has read the the

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
tyranny of structural structurelessness

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,559
essay

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,320
or is familiar with the challenges of

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,039
undocumented governance and

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,919
and norms that's a real problem and that

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,360
disadvantages a lot of people

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
not only does it disadvantage a lot of

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,799
people it just frustrates a lot of

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,279
people too

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,480
so this is where the community manager

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,919
and communications manager are going to

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,720
be really important for us

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,000
we do intend to spin up working groups

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,919
and advisory boards

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,679
and new communication mediums and

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,200
different forums probably not mailing

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,600
lists

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
that will be places that people can go

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
to figure out

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,480
how they can engage on a certain subject

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,760
whether they have time or

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,640
treasure or just feedback just

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,080
feedback we value all those things there

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,279
will be a clear way

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,559
to support osi in the coming months and

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,840
in years

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,919
it's not that way right now but that is

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,520
really one of the core things we are

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,240
looking to accomplish in the next six to

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,840
nine months

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:56,480
so look for more on that front

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:59,120
another question here uh from ruth ikika

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,559
what are the plans of osi to encourage

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,159
more beginners starting in tech to

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,919
contribute to open source

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,679
because there is skepticism of not

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,799
enough skill set and some projects are

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,320
not friendly to beginners in tech

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,760
i'm really glad you asked this question

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,120
ruth because that's near and dear to my

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
heart

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,360
i spent three years of my life traveling

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,799
the world promoting outreach programs

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,120
specifically google's number of code

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,080
google code in outreachy rails girls

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,519
summit of code

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,519
and the like it's

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,279
so important to me that we bring new

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,200
people into our projects

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,360
into our communities for a lot of

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,840
reasons

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,720
first because our communities are not

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,039
representative

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,799
of the world around us and unless our

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,559
community demographics represent

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,720
our representative of the world around

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,960
us we will inevitably build software

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
that does not serve the globe

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,320
that does not serve everybody whether

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,640
that's because our software

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,559
doesn't uh wasn't designed with people

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,120
with last mile connectivity in mind

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,720
accessibility features you know whatever

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,000
the case may be if we don't have those

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
people in our community

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,519
our software often lacks the features

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,000
and

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,600
for accommodations that they need in

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
order to use the software

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,039
so first of all we need our communities

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,159
to be more representative second of all

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,679
we need these other skill steps

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,480
one of my great complaints about open

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,399
source

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,399
is that we put code on a pedestal

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,000
so much of the time it's about show me

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,200
the code

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,320
or show me nothing and

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,960
this is a problem because i think we all

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
know

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,440
that great software is more than just

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,440
code it's the user interface it's the

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,279
user experience it's the marketing it's

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,720
the design there's so

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,080
much quality software

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,559
and if we don't have those skill sets in

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,559
our communities well again it's gonna

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,559
it's gonna let it's gonna be wanting

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,880
so what is the plan to bring new people

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
into the world

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,080
yes i've just spent a little time

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,279
justifying why we should and some of the

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
dimensions of that that are really

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,279
important to me

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,919
but how are we going to do that well for

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,399
me

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,600
it's about promoting outreach programs

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,200
as much as possible

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,200
mentorship programs uh making sure that

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,120
collectively as a community we are

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,640
putting money on the line

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,559
for people who can learn for instance

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
i'm a strong believer that relying on

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,480
free time and volunteerism

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,159
filters out a lot of very qualified

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,960
people that we desperately need in our

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
communities

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,519
and so i want to make sure that there

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
are paid internships available to work

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,039
in open source

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,559
more of them at least it's also

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,159
important to me that we provide create

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,159
more documentation and

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,399
entry points to to our communities

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,080
of course codes of conduct building a

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,320
culture of mentorship

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,559
being a welcoming community these are

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,679
all issues that will help us recruit

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,559
more people

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
and then lastly we really need to think

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,279
about how we can recruit those people

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,640
with different skill sets the people

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,559
that we're not reaching

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,399
you know for instance in the design

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,600
community having come out as a freelance

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,640
web developer

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,240
come up as a web developer i

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,320
have a strong sense of just how

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,679
sensitive designers are about spec work

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,800
aka work for free asking people to work

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,919
for free

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,679
is different in different contexts and

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,440
labor should always be compensated

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,200
but it's definitely free labor is more

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,560
sensitive in some areas than others

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,000
and so we need to find ways to meet

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,599
designers where they're at we need to

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,720
find ways to meet technical writers with

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,720
where they're at

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,639
there's no one answer but these are

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,480
things that we must solve and we must

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,200
invest in

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,320
together as a community but then also

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,679
osi

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,839
and i think you're going to see osi

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,040
create a range of documentation

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,240
and uh and put together jumping off

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,399
points that can help

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,760
be a could help the light the way for

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,960
people who are new to open source and

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,159
who happen to stumble

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,159
on opensource.org

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,520
i think we've got time for one more

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
question here um

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,720
we've got a question here from from

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,359
justin fleury

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,160
what do you see as immediate milestones

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
for increasing

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,520
and improving organizational

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,560
collaboration with osi

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,280
beyond fiscal sponsorship this is

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,280
another excellent question there are a

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
few ways to engage with osi

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,960
right now in an organization

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,720
organizational capacity

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,040
there is uh there is of course

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,839
a financial sponsorship there's of

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,119
course

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,000
you know which we get from our corporate

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,160
donors then there are our affiliates

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
and our affiliate members are

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,400
communities

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,000
schools clubs uh other open source

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
projects and foundations

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,200
that share share our values

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,280
that is where we get the bulk of our

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,119
representation by proxy through our

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,200
affiliate members which have

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,000
far larger communities than osi does

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,079
itself directly

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,680
so organizations can become an affiliate

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,079
member if they do

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,359
they are able to vote in our elections

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,880
able to put people up

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,079
for election uh and participate in our

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
quarterly calls

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,480
as well as the affiliate uh forum that

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,640
we have yet to spin up

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
uh but plan to along with the other

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,960
forums that i mentioned

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
so there's corporate sponsorship there's

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
affiliate membership

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,320
another way to engage with us in

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,400
organizational capacity

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,880
is to fire up a working group so osi has

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
a fiscal sponsorship program where we

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
host member projects like clearly

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,560
defined floss desktops for kids

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,800
and the in programs like that

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
you can spin up an incubator project you

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,640
can spin up a

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,040
member project with osi as a host you

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,440
can

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,599
spin up a working group with osi as a

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,880
host to focus on an issue that is near

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,520
and dear to you that you would like to

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,119
convene

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,640
people to discuss and explore with osi's

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,200
sort of official blessing now that's

00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,040
about

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
the limit of what we have in terms of

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,720
formal organizational

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,440
engagements at this point but this is

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,760
exactly what we're looking to improve

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,440
working groups we plan to spin up in a

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,599
number of subject matter areas like

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,520
standards for instance

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,359
working groups are a way that we can

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,119
bring volunteers together

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,200
uh people to work through specific

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,320
issues and come up with

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,160
um you know some sort of deliverable

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,839
working groups are a vehicle for getting

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,599
something done

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,280
and then there are advisory boards that

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,880
we plan to spin up also in a range of

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,920
subject matter areas

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,599
and that is really just to provide a

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,760
sounding board for osi

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,359
to provide intelligence to the community

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
to make sure that we're on top of the

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,480
issues that you're noticing

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,400
that maybe we haven't yet so

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,599
in summary organizational ways to engage

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,280
with osi

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,640
yes of course there's financial

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,920
sponsorship

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,440
we appreciate that we need that

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,200
but then there's the affiliate

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,240
membership and i would encourage you

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
whether you

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,800
run an informal user group or or an open

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,040
source project or something more formal

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,960
like a club at a university

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,640
become an affiliate member so that you

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,160
officially have a seat at the table

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,680
and you're the first to learn when

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,599
changes are coming down at osi

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,119
conspinder spinning up a working group

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,480
if there's an issue that's near and dear

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,440
to your heart

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,359
we can explore that together or consider

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,119
asking us to spin up an advisory board

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,599
or ask what advisory boards we have that

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,320
you can participate in

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,760
that you can help us that you can use to

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,760
make sure that we're on top of the

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,599
issues that matter to you

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,520
all of these are opportunities some of

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,880
them are less well-developed than others

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,240
but again these are the scenarios where

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:47,760
i expect you'll see a lot of change in

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,760
