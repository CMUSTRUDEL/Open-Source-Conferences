	Metrics for Open Source in Light of Insights from the CHAOSS Project
Georg Link

Open source communities have grown beyond what we can comprehend without tool support and metrics. However, observing community health and sustainability through metrics comes with ethical, organizational, and technological challenges. The audience will learn insights from the CHAOSS project, which establishes best practices for open source community metrics. These insights include an overview of challenges, lessons learned for starting a metric journey, and resources to get started today.
