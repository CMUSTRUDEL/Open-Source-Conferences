Description: 
	Metrics for Open Source in Light of Insights from the CHAOSS Project
Georg Link

Open source communities have grown beyond what we can comprehend without tool support and metrics. However, observing community health and sustainability through metrics comes with ethical, organizational, and technological challenges. The audience will learn insights from the CHAOSS project, which establishes best practices for open source community metrics. These insights include an overview of challenges, lessons learned for starting a metric journey, and resources to get started today.

welcome everyone to state of the source 2020

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,839
my name is georg link and i want to talk with you

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,960
about metrics for open source in light of the insights that we have

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
gained from the chaos project over the last couple of years to set the

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
stage let's travel back in time six years

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,440
heart bleed was discovered and shook the world

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
shook open source specifically what happened

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,480
heartbleed is a vulnerability inside of openssl a library an

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
open source software library that was used by

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,160
almost every server on the planet heartbleed allowed intruders to get

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,320
access to sensitive data this vulnerability was undiscovered for

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,960
many years the there's there was this mismatch that

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
really shook us all because the openssl open source library

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
was used so widely and yet when we looked at how

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
the project and the software was maintained it was a few people

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,560
who did it alongside other jobs there was this mismatch between the

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
importance of this critical infrastructure and what resources

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
were put into its maintenance

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,200
another example let's travel forward in time to 2017.

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
another especially in the united states big

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,600
earthquake so to speak was the data breach at equifax

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,799
equifax was using an open source software the struts the patchy struts

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,599
framework but failed to update it to close unknown vulnerabilities

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,520
several months later the hackers exploited this known vulnerability

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
equifax had not updated the software even though

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
the open source community had already released an update so when

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,599
we talk about the state of our

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,360
source of our projects there are many questions we have

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,120
around the health of our projects we want to know how quickly are bugs

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
fixed can i make an impact in the community

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,239
how active is the community what does the business risk of

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
using an open source software what is the project

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,319
will it still be around in the future you know there are so many questions we

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,879
have around projects that we wanted to solve

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,080
now let's formalize what i'm actually talking about when i talk about

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,519
project health i'm sure you've gotten a sense for it

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,800
from the examples but formally i think of project health as the

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
potential to continue developing software

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,920
and the examples that we just looked at openssl and equifax

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
showed that we need to ensure the production

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
of quality software and we need to monitor the health

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
of the project that we rely on and this is where

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
we will talk about metrics we will talk about today

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,840
project health why it's important we already covered that

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
and look at the challenges for understanding project health through

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
metrics what the CHAOSS project is doing to help

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
with that and i'll give you some advice for your

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,760
own metrics journey i will not cover these in order

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
they will be all meshed together but these

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,239
are the high level topics for this presentation so project health

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
we understand it is the potential to continue developing

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,239
quality software if you look in the academic research

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,320
there are three areas that academics look at

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
when they look at the health of a project they look at the source code

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,960
they look at the community that is creating and maintaining that source

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,639
code and the resources available to them

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
and there are many stakeholders that care to understand project health

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,240
users organizations whether users or creators of the software

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
the communities around these projects and of course foundations

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
and researchers

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
project health there are some who can just

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
look at a project and understand the project health these super experts

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,360
however are rare and so the proposition here is together

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,080
let's be better stronger faster and i'll use this theme better stronger

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,199
faster to guide the next set of slides

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,759
so let's get together and solve this issue the CHAOSS project we started the

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,120
CHAOSS project in 2017 as a collaborative project at the linux

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
foundation to create metrics and analytics

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,759
to help define project health we are a group of industry professionals

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,240
academics open source practitioners and we are

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
creating a platform for everyone in the open source ecosystem to

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,479
come together and work on this important topic

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,720
now when i talk about metrics it's a method of

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
measuring something and we also refer to the results

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,360
obtained from this so we have you know project data it's nebulous we

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,880
have a method to then get clear insights if you want

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,720
to use this cloud sun metaphor

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
the data the project data that i'm talking about

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,120
well there are different sources but usually we are thinking about trace data

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,759
trace data is created accidentally you know when we contribute to open source

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
projects we are creating contributions that are

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,880
public and shared with others and there's meta

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
data associated with that like who made the contribution when was

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,319
the contribution made those kinds of meta data and the

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,680
contributions themselves are the trace data we didn't

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
create the data to be analyzed we wanted to contribute to open source and we can

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,440
analyze that an issue with this is the contributions

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
contain personal identifiable information or

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,720
short pii like names and emails which leads us to

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,840
a set of ethical and legal challenges for one we need to protect personal

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,199
information sure it's public but still there are rules and

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
regulations like the european general data protection regulation or

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,520
short gdpr that applies nevertheless

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,560
we also want to be mindful about possibly

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,400
de-anonymizing individuals if we have an oddball or someone very unique in our

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,160
community and we report on the demographics which

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,440
then people can be very easily pointing fingers and saying oh

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
i know who this person is that is behaving in a

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,440
funny way we won't be mindful of those things especially as we are

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,240
talking about you know gender identity and sexual orientation and religion and

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,720
gender and areas where we know open source is lacking diversity

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
and people face discrimination it's it's a truth

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,879
there's no point in denying that also we need practices for managing data

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,919
and reporting the insights and so together

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,959
we can be better in the CHAOSS project we are developing practices

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,880
the procedures and best practices for data management

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,880
we are discussing how we can analyze communities

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,040
at scale through metrics we are looking at how can we reduce the bias in

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
decision making through our way we look at the data and

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,920
the metrics so that we can support the data driven

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,040
management and shared decision making that we want in open source we want to

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,000
share the leadership sure that sure we do have

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,560
our benevolent dictators for life but we have plenty of open source

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,120
communities that are very big and where we have shared leadership and

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,399
committees and special interest groups and we need the

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,519
data so that we're all on the same page now if you want to implement metrics in

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
your own community or as an organization you want

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,120
to understand the projects that you rely on

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,959
you will face organizational challenges for one you need to agree with everyone

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,480
on what to actually measure you need to then establish routines and

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,240
practices so that measuring just becomes part of

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
the normal day-to-day work otherwise if it's one off it's not going

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,920
to be as effective we also need to recognize diverse set of

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
contributions if we just go to the easy to observe

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,720
data and collect data like you know the git log readily available

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,560
we're limiting our point of view to that one data source

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,720
and anyone who's contributing there completely ignoring

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,600
mailing lists where people coordinate do community management event organizing

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,680
there's so many contributions that contribute to a healthy project

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,760
that we need to be aware of and have proper data on

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,160
and we also run the risk of gamification when we start having

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,160
leaderboards and people work more towards getting up

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,920
there being number one they're going to make

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,480
the contributions that get them there completely

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
or sometimes losing sight of what it actually is the project is about and

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,720
how they are contributing to it

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,720
so together we can be stronger in this regard the CHAOSS

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,760
community is developing a set of metrics that can be very inspirational

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,000
to understand how to to have a set of metrics around

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
diversity and inclusion of our communities in our project

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
to assess the risk license risk business risk

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,160
in our project to understand whether a community a project is

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,040
on the rise is mature or declining the evolution of our community

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
what are the metrics we can look at there or

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
the value what's the value of an open source project

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
to individuals the contributors to organizations

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
using and contributing to the project to society

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,959
as a whole we want to understand this and we're building out metrics to

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
understand this there are also common metrics

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,800
metrics that are shared across all of those or you know more

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,200
common challenges like how to do we attribute

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
contributions not just to the individual person but also their employers and the

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
organizations that stand behind them

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,959
there are several more lessons learned that i would like to share with you as

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
well for starting your own metric journey or

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,720
advancing in your metric journey listen start by collecting everything

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,639
when you start out just collect everything sure it's like

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,480
turning on a fire hose of data because there is so much data so many metrics

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,959
that we can look at so my second advice is to

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,720
know what you're looking for know what your goals are

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,600
then ask questions about what you need to know to reach those goals

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
or whether you are on the right track and then answer those questions

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:51,040
with the right metrics using the goal question metric approach or short gqm

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,519
helps you filter through the vast the big amount of data that you

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,519
have and tell a story just knowing that

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,000
contributions are going up is not enough to know how the community

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
is doing for example in the CHAOSS community

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,519
we had triple number of issue comments

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,160
earlier this year and well i know why it happened

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,760
because google summer of code was about to start

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,560
and there were many different students interested in working with the CHAOSS

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
community i'm we had the pleasure through google

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,600
summer of code and outreach to be working with

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,720
10 mentor mentees this year and now we have google season of docs

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
mentees so it's great but we need to understand the

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,839
background of why the number of contributions was

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
going up and we need to tell that story not just

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,000
show the graph also i already mentioned gamification

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,880
and that if we avoid leaderboards and even

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,480
individualized metrics then we avoid that gamification

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
so once we solve these organizational challenges

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,440
we may want to actually dig in and get the data but where do we get the data

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
from well think about where your community is

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
where is your project active probably there's a code

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,959
repository git usually maybe it's on github or

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,880
gitlab maybe you're using an issue tracker like

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,560
jira maybe you're using a wiki or there's a

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,240
discourse forum the mailing list maybe there's instant

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
messaging through irc or slack maybe you're

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,399
meeting offline through meetup.com wherever your project is active collect

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,480
that data but now we get to the technical

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,800
challenges getting data and making it useful is not

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,600
that easy we we have challenges around consistently collecting the data

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
especially as the platforms change as apis changes

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,440
data formats change so we need to constantly be following up

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,880
with that also people use different usernames and

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
different email addresses to contribute to open source so we need

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
to manage those identities and merge them

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,240
together the data may be coming in in different

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
formats date how many different ways are there to

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,079
display data and encode it so if we want to have

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,279
a platform where we have all this data together we

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,720
need to standardize that unified and then calculate metrics we may know

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
when an issue was opened we may know when it was closed

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
uh but we may be interested in how long it actually was open

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
and so we need to take end date and start date

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,040
and calculate the difference and store this in our data so we can analyze it

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
and then we need to visualize and report the information and so together

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,480
in CHAOSS we are building software to give you a jump start with collecting

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,959
the data from communities to present the metrics and analytics to

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,320
users through visualizations we are doing experiments we are trying

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,040
out new metric ideas and practices and we have different

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,560
software packages that are actively being used and maintained the

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
going from the right to the left the cregit

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,959
project helps you look at source code and who is responsible for adding

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,560
something you know similar to git blame but git blame works at the line

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
level and get the cregit goes to the token level so

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,079
you can actually see who added that variable

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,920
who last edited this function name even though the line might have been

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,279
edited for other reasons augur the next project is a research

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,320
project at the university of nebraska at omaha

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,639
and the university of missouri it's the research project that started

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,400
alongside CHAOSS where we are trying out new things and starting from scratch how

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
would we approach open source metrics today and then all

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,400
the way on the left is the grimoirelab project this is a project

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
that was started by bitergia a company that

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
is providing metrics analytics dashboards to

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,880
customers in a professional way and grimoirelab has that history is very

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,720
mature and was one of the founding projects of

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,160
the CHAOSS project as well so use the CHAOSS software

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,840
rounding up coming to a conclusion CHAOSS provides a variety of resources i can

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,320
also recommend the CHAOSS cast our podcast where we talk

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,000
about stories and experiences of measuring community health and

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
project health and sharing those insights

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,320
of how we actually go about doing this you have the metrics that we create as

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
building blocks for your own metric strategy

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,679
you can use the software as your tooling and

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,960
join the CHAOSS community we are your peer group to discuss any concerns any

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,679
issues any problems and offer advice and

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,960
develop solutions together so here are my resources the links to the podcast to

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,120
the metrics take a look at them take the software out for

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,880
spin and then join the mailing list listen in

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
to what we are working on and then when you're ready

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
start participating in the working groups that we have

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,240
so together we can be better stronger faster we can understand

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
project health we're working on the metrics on the software

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,640
that gets us there so that we can have reliable sustainable open source

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
projects and not just have them but also identify

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,120
where we have areas of improvement with that i am rounding it off thank you

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,840
so much for listening coming to my presentation

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,000
virtually i am on linkedin and twitter reach out

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,440
to me connect with me i'm happy to take any questions now but also just

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,120
send me an email later i'm happy to strike up a conversation and i'm always

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,039
happy to hear new stories and offer my advice

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:45,280
so thank you everyone for being here the

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,280
i don't think there's any questions right now

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,919
so i just want to reiterate that we are the the CHAOSS

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,480
project we are here for you we want to provide

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,600
a platform for the open source ecosystem for everyone who is interested

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,480
in metrics to have this place to get help and support

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,960
and find resources so i'm i'm warmly inviting all of you that

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,559
as you're embarking on a metric journey to check out

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,679
what we have already created but then also share your own story

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,520
we'd love to hear from you one of the things i'll just

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
keep talking until someone asks me a pointed question

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,520
one of the things that i know some are especially companies are interested

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,919
in is to have like an inventory of open

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,799
source projects and to have like a green

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,240
yellow red stoplight system to know hey these are the projects we need to

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,919
pay attention to versus these are fine and we call this quality models

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,240
you want to build out a quality model that where you define

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
if these metrics are all within this bandwidth

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,880
then we're good but if they have spikes or there's something going on then i

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,760
want to be alerted and so yeah quality models is something

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
that we're currently working on in the CHAOSS project and

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,760
there's more to come so jeff asks have any open source

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,280
software projects not wanted their metrics used

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,919
okay so are any projects scared to share or not want to

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,240
participate for political or other reasons

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,320
so where does metrics come from there are basically two ways that i've

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,240
seen metrics starting to be collected and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,679
generated one is just companies

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,440
and people who are interested about an open source project

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,360
to start collecting data

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,880
data is public because we work in the open

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,919
so the git log is public you can just clone the repo and we all want that as

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
an open source community and then you can run your

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,960
analysis on that there are other types of analyses that

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,640
are more tricky like if you're collecting

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,679
twitter feeds or [inaudible] and so on the

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,360
other way that i see metrics starting to be generated is actually the communities

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,240
themselves where the their

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,640
committees or community engagement special interest groups that want to

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,000
know what is going on in our community how can we improve our communities

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,360
or how do we know who has voting rights who do we elevate into the status of

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,799
whatever status you have in your community

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,840
and so the community itself starts to track its own activities to elevate what

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,240
people are doing i have not

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,520
seen any project that that opts out of metrics

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
not that there's really a good way right now either

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,640
what i have seen is individuals who say okay i don't want my data to be

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
tracked and this goes into legal and ethical

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,320
concerns about personal identifiable information

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:56,559
where we have laws like gdpr in europe let's say we as the contributors to open

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,200
source own our own data even if we

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
make it available through open source projects

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,559
through our contributions we still get a say in how that data is being used

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,520
and so if we want to do ethical data analysis on open source project

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,200
because we don't know if we have any europeans who

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
gdpr would apply to before we start an analysis we should

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
inform the community saying hey we're starting to have a dashboard we're

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
starting to analyze the data from this project and

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
anyone who does not want to be included in this analysis

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,400
um can opt out so that's an ethical way to approach

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
this but this is really at the individual level not at the project

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,240
level that you're asking maybe that was a very roundabout answer

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,279
to your question but it's a it's a big

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,679
concern i know a lot of people who are starting to look

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
at metrics have this concern especially when they're

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,919
working in organizations how do we make this

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
ethical how do we make it uh how do we comply with

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,440
regulations like gdpr and from an open source project perspective

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,080
there are benefits to having metrics one is you actually want to showcase say

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,039
hey we have a need for help for contributors

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,320
and here are the metrics to show where help is needed

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,760
or we want to highlight here's where we are

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,960
especially active because activity begets more activity and

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
you want to highlight that activity that's why marketing

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,120
open source projects is important to their success

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,840
and having metrics to help with that is quite powerful

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
on that note we are at our time limit thank you so much

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,679
for your participation thanks for your presentation and addressing all the

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:24,080
questions thanks everyone see you around

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
