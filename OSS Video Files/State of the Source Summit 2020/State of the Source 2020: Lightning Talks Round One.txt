	00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
thank you much for being here and for this uh opportunity i'm jomar silva from

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,960
brazil and i'm the uh the

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,640
head of developer relations at zup so why brazil matters to open source and

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
to us all here uh according uh even latest corporation

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
this is a study and following through the past years

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
brazil become the fifth largest uh developer community population in the

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,359
world in four years so we're gonna pass over

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,640
japan and we we are leading uh this growth in

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,440
latin america which is the second region that is growing uh much faster in the

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,960
world and in the past 10 to 15 years ago

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,239
brazil has a huge open source community open

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,399
source was really huge in brazil and just to illustrate how huge this was

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
i'm not talking only about community i've heard about policies today

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,360
this is a picture a couple of pictures taken from

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
the international free software forum from 2009

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,439
it was the 10th edition of the forum and this guy with the red hat

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,960
is a brazilian president former president lula

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,119
uh talking with simon phipps and also bruno zozo and yes he's wearing

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,799
a java ring and also he's using an odf cap

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
some of you might remind remind me from the odf days

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,799
i was the odf executive director for odf alliance in latin america and i was on

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,880
the eye of the hurricane of that open open xml

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
versus odf fight we had on iso a couple of years ago

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,720
so after all this hype uh all the movement and all the excitement faded

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
away but open source is now mainstream all

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,720
over the world and also here in brazil the good part of it everyone is using it

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
and it works we weren't a bunch of crazy freedom

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
fighters at the time it works and the bad part of it people

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,399
don't know what it is anymore so long story short

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
i spent eight years working at intel in the hardware side of the industry

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
and i'm back to peer software and this is what i find when i come back

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,959
free as in beer all over again license what people don't know nothing

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,599
about licenses yeah this is true also intellectual

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
property rights is something that they don't know

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
nothing about and by the way in brazil we don't have software patents

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,720
so it makes things much much more complicated here to talk about ipr and

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
it's the same on latin america okay i'm talking about brazil but it's the same

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,360
all over latin america i was working on latin america over the

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
past 10 years and also people really thinks that open

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
source means it's on github on a public repository right yes

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
i'm listening those kind of questions not only for developers but for

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
entrepreneurs from company owners from everyone involved in open source

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,599
software and it's a huge population of people

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,640
that only use open source that they they start using open source on the college

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,120
they use open source over the past 10 years

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
but they really don't know what it is about so this is how i feel

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,599
oh god what have i done why we stopped talking to us those guys why we

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
stopped explaining to people what open source is

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,280
about and this is what we have to do

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
we need to start it all over again to revamp the communities and to revamp

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,080
basically contributions we need to explain to people uh much more about

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,680
open source how they can get involved and what are their role and

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
responsibilities on this we need to retake the open source

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
conversation and what motivated me to build this

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
presentation is because i've spent the past two months talking with friends

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,080
from open source community all over the world

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,239
sharing what i'm facing in brazil and guess what it's the

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,360
same on several other countries doesn't matter if it's asia

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,560
if it's europe if it's u.s north america anywhere else so startups are building

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,439
open source enterprises are running up on open source today including banks

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
developers are using open source but they really

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,959
don't know what they are doing actually they know what they are doing but they

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,080
really don't know what they're doing so developers needs to know their role

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
and their force and their powers behind the scenes

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,840
and i do believe that we need to do something about it

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
the company i work for and we are proud to sponsor this event

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,400
is zup i invite you to take a look on this website where we have information

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
about our open source projects and we will be

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,360
available to talk to you on the next hallway session and i can

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
answer questions and talk more about what we are opening our projects

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,600
down here and this is uh the question that i left

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
for you how is that in your country are you

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
talking to developers not the senior guys but the young ones

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,840
what we can do about it thank you so much this is those are my

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
contacts please keep in touch and let us face

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
this together thank you

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,600
next up we have javier hi my name is javier perez i'm open

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,000
source program manager for ibm and it is time to spell out open source

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,280
software for mainframes uh main frames today

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
look more like the picture that you see at the bottom not the image that most of

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
us have with the picture on on top it's been

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,520
decades of innovation uh since the 1950s and some of the

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
technologies or some of the uh concepts and architecture ideas that

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,720
we see today within the cloud things like virtual machines containers

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,759
workload isolation they've been around in the mainframe for

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
many many years and they have been actually perfected

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,560
over over the years things like continuous availability and disaster

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
recovery it's been there for many many years and

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,759
continues to improve things like encryption and cryptography

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,400
uh you have the best platform out there uh with the mainframe and in fact it's

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,360
not called mainframe anymore it's ibm z and we have ibm z and a linux one to

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,520
couple of versions of this platform ibm z where

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,759
you can collocate different operating systems

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,880
or linux one that is exclusively just for

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
for linux and let me give you a couple of numbers of these

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,360
great best performance platform you can have up to one trillion web

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
transactions http transactions per day you can have more than two million

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,000
docker containers in the platform you can compress a lot of data you can

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,039
compress up to 275 gigabytes of data per second uh so very amazing numbers

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,280
that you get with this with this platform and

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,720
and of course it's all about open source right

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
uh open source is actually it's been around since 1955 in the mainframe

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
uh there was a they created a group called share a group that is still

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,759
around actually and they had their conference just a couple of weeks ago

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,000
it was a volunteer uh run user group back then and they was created to share

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,319
information about the software in the mainframe so back then it was not called

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,520
open source but you can trace uh some of the origins of open source uh

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
with that with that group that is still still

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,039
around and of course linux has been around for many years as well you know

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,639
about 30 years uh but it was deployed it was installed

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,759
with big investments from ibm into a mainframe back in 2000

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
so so we are 20 years now of uh continuous

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,319
improvements on linux uh optimize the linux yes they opened

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,000
the same standard open source linux to take advantage

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,280
of the features of of this platform and in fact their numbers are amazing

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,879
like most enterprises now run um the mainframes the ibm z and linux

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,720
one uh on linux

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
and when we talk about linux we talk about that it runs everywhere right from

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
your mobile device to any type of uh architecture we talk

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,960
about arm or arm 64 for things like raspberry pi

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,039
or arduino to of course common servers on x86 or

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,320
power or even spark there are still a few around

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,279
there the processor architecture for the mainframes is known as s390x

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,880
and all you have to do is to you know have a compiled version of

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
linux in the corresponding processor

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,920
architecture and the same goes to your software

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,399
and again it regardless if it's a mainframe or it's a raspberry pi

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
you have to compile on the corresponding architecture so

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
here are a few technical considerations when you're looking into

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
porting your software uh especially open source software

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,160
to your mainframe ibm vnc or linux1 by the way most of the software really

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,839
just works right you just have to recompile it or build it again

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
maybe just some minor changes but it just works

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,360
if there are specific functionality that it was for other processor architecture

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,880
well that's what you have to to address or making

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
changes especially specifically if they were

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
just just you know custom for that processor architecture

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,640
and really the only difference is the use of a big endian memory allocation if

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
you are doing low level memory allocation

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,920
with the ibm z platform it's based on the big endian memory location

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,600
corresponds to the most significant byte or less significant byte allocation

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
and again it's only for low level memory allocation and of course you can always

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,760
take advantage of uh you know the the features the

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,519
compression the speed to improve your software while you're

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,079
porting to this platform i'm going to leave you with this slide

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
uh these are some of the most recognizable

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
uh logos there on open source software out there they are all of the

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,079
these are available in ibm z and linux one and i invite you to keep

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,320
contributing to open source it is really easy to port your software

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
to this great high performance platform and

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
with that thank you very much and we'll see you soon

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,480
thank you next up we have

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,720
christina all right how are we doing can you hear me now yep you're loud and

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
clear thank you my name is christina huppy and

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
i am a senior education program manager at gitlab

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,640
and today i'm going to be talking about open source a unique opportunity

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,160
for career development and underserved and underrepresented populations trying

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,079
to enter the the tech industry um so first if you have not heard of git

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
lab um we are the only um complete end-to-end

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,640
application for the devops lifecycle um we are also an open core company and

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,560
we have a very active open source um community to so

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
shout out to anyone who's on listening today who's part of our

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,160
community we have over 3 000 code contributors and an average

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,360
of 200 different uh contributions a month

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
so i want to start off by taking a little bit of a look of about some

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,079
demographic data for the the tech industry

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,440
um this is some data from the the stack overflow survey and then also some data

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,320
compiled from from wired magazine and if we look at

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,279
the the tech industry by gender we can see that it's

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,480
very heavily male dominated at over 91 percent um and then it's also um also dominated

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
at 72 percent by by white and so there is a lack of

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
diversity um in the tech industry and and the data

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,160
from wired showed that despite some of the efforts by the

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,360
big tech companies over the last four or five years we

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,720
definitely have um room for improvement and increasing diversity in the tech

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
industry uh this is a great figure that

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,880
summarizes some of the barriers for people on trying to enter

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
the the tech industry all the way from at the beginning

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
um a lack of social capital on social networks to bias and hiring

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,399
and bias and advancement opportunities um and i think it's really

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
important to note that even just getting that first foot in the door

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,240
um is a struggle and and the lack of experience

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
um is is part of that building up building up the resume from

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,120
the very beginning and what i want to really focus on today in a few minutes

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
um that we have is to talk about what's different about open source and how open

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
source can help remove some of these barriers

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
um first of all open source by nature has and everyone can contribute

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,360
mentality um so the more contributors in general

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,279
uh the better off obviously an open source project is it

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,680
also has a self-service mentality so our repos our docs

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,600
are being getting started the community the governance is all publicly

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
generally available um and and people can find it and read it and learn how to

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
access it um also something that's really unique

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
is that there are feedback mechanisms in place so

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,440
if you make a code request a merge request there's going to be an advanced

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,040
developer who's part of the community is going to review your work and give you

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,000
feedback um and that that's actually a great natural setup for mentoring

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,279
um we know that not all open source communities are perfect and some of them

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,560
can be a little bit inclusive uh there can be a high technological barrier

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
um and so we definitely you know as an as a as

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,440
as an industry as a community as a sector we definitely have room to grow

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,639
in that regard um and what i want to definitely what i

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
want to just say today is that some of the things that open source

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,399
projects can do to help remove that barrier and stop

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,639
leaks in the tech pipeline is to be intentional and inclusive to

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,199
new contributors encourage mentorship within your open

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,760
source projects and value um those those low barrier

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,040
contributions so not just the very technical contributions but simple

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
contributions how people um kind of get started and what i want

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,440
to do is share some of the things that we do at git lab

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
to help with these contributions um we have a

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,480
uh a good for new contributors label i'm sorry um someone clicked on my link

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,440
there so it's it's greyed out but um the idea is that we have a label in

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,320
git lab that says good for new contributors and so if

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,120
you're someone trying to enter the tech industry

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,199
we have really low barrier on issues that you can work on

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,720
we have meetups specifically for new contributors

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
um we have merger request coaches that are all available

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
on in our handbook you can find them we actually have a page

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
um they're publicly listed uh they're available

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
in actually in the platform you can message

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,480
um @gitlab-org-coaches on your merge request and our team

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,320
it really prides themselves on helping you get through get your

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,000
your change merged uh we also have um we our team the community relations team

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,440
connects um the community members with experts

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,720
through through merge requests um through our forum at forum.gitlab.com

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,079
uh through gitter as well and then we also really value and make a big effort

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,800
to to celebrate first-time contributors

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,480
including sending them swag we have a dashboard there i encourage

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,759
you to take a look at that um new contributor label and then also

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,040
um social social mentions and then i'd like to stop with just

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
talking a little bit about a great partnership that we have at git lab

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
um we're working with the last mile which is an organization that prepares

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,079
um incarcerated individuals for re-enter entry into into society and um

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,160
we've done over five meet-ups with them in the last couple months and we've had

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
our ceo said and some of our technical evangelists

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,000
teach about um about git lab and devops in general

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
we're also mentoring them on the technical recruiting

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,600
pipeline and process and in a few days we're gonna have our first

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,199
everyone um can contribute uh meet up for first-time contributors um

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,199
with it with with the last mile so i'm really excited to share some of these

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,120
best practices with you and i would love to

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,839
connect with the audience and i'll look out for questions thanks

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,199
next up we have stephen jacobs all right so i'm here to tell you a

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
little bit about a new university open source or really

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,480
open programs office at rit um all right so a little history

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
on rit and open source i've been running programs initially

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,600
called foss at rit and then called foss at magic

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
from 2009 it's a student-centric primarily

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,160
undergrad effort that started with making educational games for the olpc

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,440
and a kind of a historical but also true article on what that program looks like

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,880
is called the course of co-op life cycle over in open source.com

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,000
we had the first minor in open source for university and find more information

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
about that there and we've been running something called

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,559
libre core which has been a humanitarian focused

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,120
co-op and intern program for the past six or seven years we just finished a

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,880
contract with unicef innovation and you can find

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,360
information about how that worked and the

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
documents and stuff we created to help them build

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,640
their open source pipelines and communities at that link

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
um in summer 2019 johns hopkins university

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
working with moss labs which is primarily

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,160
a municipal open source focus group soft launch of johns hopkins university

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,720
hospital and taking that as a queue i worked with

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,440
my university starting november of 2019 to start pitching that idea to them in

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,240
february of 2020 they asked me to hold a campus-wide meeting

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
to see what interest there might be and what

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
what surprised me was the wide interest we had 50 people from

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,760
37 units across campus who are svp that's just not computer science and i.t

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,919
that's the library that's our technical photography programs

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,720
that's digital humanities just a huge range of people who either

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,760
were already working in open source open data open science

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
or people who wanted to learn more about how to move that forward

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,799
so in june we got our approval to become a key research center

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,200
within the university and we have a charter

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
that was derived primarily from a bunch of

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
bottom-up meetings that we had after that first

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:37,200
community meeting we worked with about 20 to 25 faculty and staff members even

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,559
during pandemic and over zoom to create a kind of

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,799
master wish list that we then derived our chart from

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,320
and we became officially a part of the university just

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,320
last month what we're going to be focusing on is

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,760
discovering what people are doing on campus because i know that there are

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
plenty of people working in these spaces but nobody knows who's doing what

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,760
collect metrics on and promote those talk about what the university does

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,640
in open work overall which is what i'm using to include open source open data

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:18,159
open hardware etc to go ahead and find and or point folks and create new

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,240
professional development stuff on how you get involved and open or how to

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,760
improve your open to advise but not take over compliance

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,559
with the cio and legal and to work with development and alumni relations to find

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,000
opportunities for grants industries support programs

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,919
other networking programs and last but not least here is our website

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,600
which became live today which you can find a lot more

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,200
information about what we hope to do and since we're

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,640
behind time uh i'm going to go ahead and stop here

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,799
and leave it open for questions in the shared notes or the public chat

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,520
thanks next we have alyssa

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,200
wright hello state of the source -ers was i the first one to make that

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
joke i really hope not anyway i'm alyssa wright and i'm here

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
to talk about a collaboration to bring an open source contribution

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,799
model to the university setting generally and johns hopkins university

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:32,240
network specifically and this is us being excited yay

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
so this is a open source collaboration um

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,640
led by john hopkins uh funded by the alfred p

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,640
sloan foundation uh kind of supported by the foresight of indeed and

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
implemented by us at open source collective

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,360
more yay!! i'm alyssa wright i help lead open community and open

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,520
partnerships at open source collective and at open source collective we look to

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,440
build healthy and resilient and equitable

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,840
open source ecosystems we provide fiscal and legal infrastructure for open

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,559
source with sustainability tools and

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,640
integrations and the foss contributor fund is a big

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
part of that the contributor fund has been pretty

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,200
impactful in the company setting so the kind of

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,360
thesis question excitement yay here is what does the contributor fund look

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,840
like in the university setting

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,520
so quick history of the contributor fund this is a brainchild of duane o'brien

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,400
and the indeed team each month uh con internal contributors

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
to open source they vote on the most meaningful most

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,520
impactful open source projects for them those are tabulated and

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:10,080
ten thousand dollars are contributed to the open source project winner

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
and so different to other sponsorship models the foss contributor fund

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
puts open source business viability into the hand

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
of a company's technologists thereby further democratizing

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
open source sustainability

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,080
so a little example of that one that's close to home

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,880
is openstreetmap i've been part of the openstreetmap community for

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,120
many many years um and on the board of open street map us and we were an early

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,279
indeed uh recipient of their contributor for

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,600
fund

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
and not only were we humbled by this we didn't even know

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,720
of a shared relationship but the uh the contribution uh allowed for

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,880
mutual visibility and acknowledgement and so that from personal allows us to

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
segue to the university setting

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,600
meet sayeed choudhury sayeed is the brainchild out of this contributor fund

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,520
collaboration he is the associate dean of research

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,320
data management at john hopkins university

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
and a big proponent of bringing open source

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,480
to the university

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,240
so you would think a john johns hopkins contributor fund would be

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,279
pretty much a cut and paste of uh you know in a company setting

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,840
no it's a lot of what you might expect and a whole lot more

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,600
so some things to think about when considering open source at johns hopkins

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,919
and open source i think within the university setting

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,919
open source is at the heart of great research and development

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,159
and the educational framework of jhu but one must ask what is the visibility

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,679
of that commitment does the econ department know what open

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,760
source projects the biostatistics department are relying on

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,840
and or contributing to for their work can the hours of open source project

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,039
engagement be acknowledged in a professor's tenure

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,520
portfolio we're implementing a general general contributor fund for

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,039
john hopkins and we're building technical tools that

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,240
will accelerate the impact of contributor funds

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
both for john hopkins hopefully to respond to some of those questions

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,919
but for the entire ecosystem university company or otherwise

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,840
these tools will scale the contributor fund

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,919
and also allow us to see the impact and assessment and

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,320
assessment of our foss contributions

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,480
these tools will empower the open source community of jhu

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,480
to support the ecosystems they care about not just the high visibility

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
projects of a many tiered network

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
so let's go back to the openstreetmap example

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:25,440
so let's say the statistics department loves openstreetmap i mean can't do

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,720
crime statistics without it but the infrastructure

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,320
of openstreetmap that they really need is not

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,240
exactly the shapefiles of openstreetmap it's a little bit further down the stack

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,080
in the pelias geocoder do they know that how visible

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,000
is that dependency and then in that impact like in the

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
contribution model these are things that we hope to

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,679
surface uh in in our building of a

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,799
contributor fund in the university and something that's um

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,080
much more sophisticated scalable um and nuanced

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,320
uh for for everyone so finally just some guiding questions

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,360
um how do universities break down

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,640
department silos in order to collectively collaborate

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,000
on the ecosystems of open source how do we acknowledge

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
the university community in their work to sustain open source

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,559
so that they can be recognized by the academy

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,159
and what is our responsibility to bring universities into the design

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,960
of open source contribution models these are all really great questions

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,799
questions that we hope to lend insight into as we build out this

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,240
project questions i hope that you will join us and

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,399
next up we have robert jacobi alrighty it all worked that's fantastic

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,240
thank you open source uh initiative uh very excited to be here

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,520
we've heard some great conversations and what i

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:06,640
love to focus on is creating life and excitement in open source communities so

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,279
one of the things that i think is very important is creating

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,640
to stop churn and let's get into a little bit of the story uh just have

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,600
to do the obligatory blip robert jacobi lots of agency work former

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
president of joomla technically open source

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,799
matters uh solution matters ambassador and open

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,840
source partnerships sort of expert let's get to the story then so the story

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,640
is about open source projects and communities

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,720
they typically come with a great idea at the beginning

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
a new operating system a new content management system

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,799
something that's going to really change the world and there's a few people that

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,760
are very integrated into that sort of

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,840
technological aspect of it so we're building something awesome and

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,440
that can be really really exciting and you know you get sort of that tight

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,159
cohesive team to build the actual uh beginnings of an

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,640
open source project and as that gains momentum we wind up

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,120
getting an actual community and building a

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
community and then those are growing from social media from

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,559
the actual project websites you know github git lab

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,559
all the other types of opportunities for both

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,840
developers and now even non-developers to get involved

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,679
within a project and this is great so now we have we have

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,399
some bit of code we have some bit of community and then

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,240
uh it's getting used stuff's happening what's going on

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,399
okay is is there a momentum are is is leadership leaving are people

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,039
getting less involved the project are the

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,880
economics of a specific project getting uh taken away from it to some

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
degree so now what's what's the important thing

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,919
and and what i really believe is that we need to

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,840
keep the continuous creation and development process going

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,080
and that really goes into building more not necessarily more on

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
top of it not bloke or s uh you know future nonsense of madness

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,840
it's really about keeping a level of excitement so that

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
there is a level of churn that should be expected in a

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
project and community people are always going to come in and out there there

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,640
might be some latest and greatest feature set that they're interested in

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,039
implementing taking advantage of for personal or uh

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
you know private corporate reasons and they're going to dive in they're going

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,279
to do the best they can because that has some immediate value that should be

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,919
expected as part of a community and project that

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,440
these sort of uh open source ninjas are going to

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,960
come in and out but there also needs to be a level of sustainability for the

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,559
maintenance for the bug fixes for the incremental uh

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,279
functionality and features that occur but we should never never be afraid of

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,799
forcing that agenda of creating something new

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,760
we've seen that in you know many projects that the most

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,039
recent example of is in the wordpress community where they

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,880
implemented gutenberg blocks which you know was was really like

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,600
pretty much taking out the audio adapter from the iphone people were really

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,159
up and arms on it but it kind of drove a technological level of advancement they

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,640
were creating and trying to build something new

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,960
yes there's still an infrastructure that an ecosystem that holds everyone in

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,760
place but people who were interested in

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,720
something new and something exciting were able to dive in where they may have

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,960
not been a part of a project that had sort of seemed to be like oh it's

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,679
just another content management system so these things need to happen that

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
there needs to be you know that risk-taking and open

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,240
source projects very similar to what companies need to

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,720
do to keep themselves exciting and interesting

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
to their audience which might be consumers or other businesses

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,159
open source communities have a constituency

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,519
and that constituency is people and their free time why

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,640
do they want to be part of that community it can be for many reasons but

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
one of the key ones is expecting an ability to create and

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,559
innovate and that's what i hope that people can

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,320
get out of creating to stop the churn people will

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,240
come in and evolve with the project and make

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,320
that happen don't be afraid create and innovate

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
thank you very much

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,960
up next we have jim hall dev control all right so i'm jim hall and this is a

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,200
fun talk about why linux only has 16 colors now i'm not

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,240
talking about uh graphics mode obviously you know more

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,559
colors there but what i'm really talking about is

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,519
text mode when you boot your computer up in text mode why are you only getting

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,880
these 16 foreground colors and these eight

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,799
background colors why 16 and 8 and why do the colors

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,559
look the way they do why do they look some other way well it kind of all

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:09,039
dates back to the original ibm pc as many things and technology do 1981 is

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,559
when the standard got set with the ibm color graphics array

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,279
and that was the first ibm for computer that could display

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,000
color so uh in order to understand this you need

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
to get a little bit of grounding for binary a lot of you may know binary but

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,559
some of you don't so a quick little brief here is that

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,480
binary is either on or it's off it's kind of like a light it's either on or

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,640
it's off and uh each one of those on and off is

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,640
called the bit and computers like to count in uh bytes

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,640
which is eight bits so uh and and numbers start from the

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,320
right hand side and they go 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,679
but on these first four rows here you can see i'm only counting the numbers

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,679
one two three and four right you can see

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,159
that if i've only got the one bit lit up then that's a one if i've

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,320
got the two bit lit up obviously that's a two if i got both one and two lit up

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,399
that's a three and so on right so that's how binary works and of course

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,480
we don't write binary out using uh little light bulbs and little circles we

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,839
actually use little ones and zeros and so that's how we're going

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,320
to talk about this throughout the rest of the talk

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,440
so we can represent colors using any combination of red

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,440
green and blue light and so the ibm engineers when they created the color

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,919
graphics array they knew that that's that's all they

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,320
needed they just needed red green and blue light and in fact if all

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,960
we're going to do we can actually in the simplest case

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,159
we can do a mixture of that where it's either

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,960
the red green or blue is on or it's off and so we can control each one of those

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,919
colors red green blue or rgb we can control that using those bits

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,760
and so you can see if i don't have any of the uh of those bits turned on i've

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,920
got zero zero zero i'm gonna get black if we got zero zero one only the blue

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,240
bit is lit up and so i'm getting blue and so on down the line to things like

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,359
uh white where i'm going to mix all of the colors red green and blue equally

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,800
and that's going to give me white now that only gives me eight

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,880
colors right so i can only count up to eight in that case from zero to seven

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,560
so how do i get more colors well if i'm a smart engineer at ibm i know that if i

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,720
add an extra bit i can get double the number of colors

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,280
and so how does that work so now i'm going to add what's called an

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,440
intensity bit so intensity irg intensity rgb or irgb and so

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,119
now the left hand bit is now the intensity and so if i have the intensity

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,280
turned off i'm just getting the colors uh that are sort of low intensity colors

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,079
and if i have the intensity bit turned on then i'm getting bright intensity

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,920
color so i might choose like a in a simple case i might say okay well

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
the intensity bit's turned on i'm going to turn all those lights on at

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,599
full brightness and if i had the intensity

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,640
bit turned off then i'm going to turn i'm going to set those colors to some

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,520
let's say mid tone or mid brightness value and

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,160
that means i can now get colors that are going from zero to 15 that's 16

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,640
colors except wait a second i don't uh black and

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,440
bright black are the same black because there's

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,320
nothing being lit up uh but that's okay uh we can fix that um

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,720
we can uh we can say okay if the light and if the low intensity colors that

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
that that first bit is a zero then uh any of

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,040
the zeros in the rgb positions let me just

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,520
let those be off but if they're on i'm going to turn them

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,359
onto only just two-thirds value just like two-thirds brightness

00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,119
but at the high intensity so if that first bit that the intensity bit is

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,119
turned on that's a one then any zeros in the rgb positions

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,520
they're going to be only set at one third position but any

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,440
ones are set at full brightness right and so that gives me now an ability to

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,160
have differentiation between uh black and bright black and so now

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,119
that gives me this set of colors so now i'm getting

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,680
the colors that we are familiar with on a pc

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,040
and now i can i have colors that go black blue green

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,720
cyan red magenta yellow and white and i have also the bright versions of that

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,240
and that's why you have a bright black and now i can represent all

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,599
the colors the rainbow oh shoot i actually can't represent the

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,320
colors of the rainbow because rainbow if you remember actually has

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
uh orange in it so red orange yellow green and a blue indigo and violet and i

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,000
can fake the other colors but i don't have an orange in there so

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,440
that's okay uh if we're a smart engineer at ibm we're gonna say okay

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,560
we're gonna turn that low intensity yellow uh into an

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,240
orange we're gonna do that by setting one third on the green value so

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,079
uh the uh if we're asking for a low intensity yellow

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,720
uh then the green is going to be set to a 1 3 value so that's going to give me

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,520
something that is now orange and so now i've got a list of colors that goes from

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,560
0 to 15 and that is the full list of those 16

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,599
colors and now that low intensity yellow has been renamed from

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,079
yellow into orange except we're not going to call it orange we'll call it

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,839
brown because we've got to mess it up somewhere

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,880
uh but that's why we have uh the the low intensity colors and those bright colors

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,440
now that's why we have 16 colors but why do we only have eight colors in the

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,640
background well again remember that computers like to

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,960
count in full bytes a byte is eight bits and so

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,720
uh we just used four bits intensity rgb for the foreground color so there's four

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,760
bits right there and the background colors are they're

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
clearly only picking up you know half the colors and so we're

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,800
only getting uh three bits on that one right three bits

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,240
for the background so what's that last bit that's seven bits there so

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,760
what's my last bit what's the final eighth bit uh on the uh

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,119
uh that would fill this out well it's the most important

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,240
uh uh bit of of all user interface design and that is the blink bit and so

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,640
now that gives us a full bite i have eight bits that's

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,640
that that's a full bite and that is uh every time you represent

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,520
color on a an ibm compatible display you are using

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,119
a full byte to display the the text color and the background color and

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,720
whether or not it's blinking and so that is the full byte and that is why

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,000
uh linux only has these 16 foreground colors and

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,599
eight background colors so thank you very much

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:20,000
and up next we have debbie so hi everyone i am deb goodkin and i'm

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,280
the executive director of the freebsd foundation

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,400
and i'm coming to you from beautiful snowy boulder colorado

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,480
so let's see here the purpose of my talk is to tell you about one of

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,440
the oldest largest and most successful open source projects

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
around and really how we can be a model for

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,680
other open source projects and i'm hoping that um in this five minutes that

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,960
i have with you that um that it can raise awareness

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,280
about free bsd and our project and help build bridges

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,560
and connect us with other open source projects

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,520
many people do know about us but you know sometimes we get lost and or we're

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,839
ignored because we're not the newest shiny

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,240
open source project out there though i do believe we are when the

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,280
or we do have the coolness factor sort of like what

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
linux had compared to windows back in the day

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,760
so um trying to continue our our growth um or by continuing our growth i think

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,560
this will help benefit the open source ecosystem

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,119
in general so what is freebsd now i have to

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,800
always say this because there's still people out there who believe that

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,839
it's a linux distribution and it's not so freebsd is a computer operating

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,599
system and um and it's a complete operating system

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
and so that means it is the kernel user land

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,079
everything that makes an operating system

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,680
package now freebsd descended from berkeley unix

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,720
and which descended from the original enx

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,839
out of bell labs and it's been around for 27 years used by universities

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,359
corporations and individuals using it on their

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,000
desktops so this is a an abridged um you know

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,480
history of freebsd so first you had enx coming out of bell labs in 1969

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,599
and then uh berkeley also took it and they were doing research and development

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,359
on it too and that started in 1974 and then freebsd and net bsd branched

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,720
out in 1993.

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,760
and there's a lot of companies that use freebsd you just don't really hear about

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,800
it because it's not like they they promote that their products are

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,000
based on freebc but i i selected a bunch of uh

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,119
recognizable companies here so you would see that

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,040
and you're probably using freebsd too because uh mac os

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,480
was based on freebsd if you're watching movies

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,080
that those are all downstream or um i mean those are

00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,880
um all coming to you from uh freebsd servers

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,560
so the goal of the project really is to provide software

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,720
that may be used for any purpose and without any strings

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,280
attached so the way that the project works this first it was based on

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,920
the original model that they used in berkeley but over the 27 years it's

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,680
um they've been improving that model that to work you know as an open source

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,160
project and uh so there's thousands of

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,800
contributors and contributors or developers

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,240
as well as other people who are uh contributing like

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,040
advocacy like what i'm doing right now and then there's hundreds of committers

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,280
and those committers are individuals who can

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,119
us actually submit changes to the source tree

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,319
and then we have a nine-member elected court team

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,640
who governs and they lead the project and those are

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,960
democratically elected um from from the other committers on the project

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,240
and we do have a strong mentorship culture also the

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,240
freebsd foundation which i run is a whole separate

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,440
independent organization we're a 501c3 and it means that we're you know we

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
support the project for the public good and our whole mission

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
is to support the freebsd project in the community

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,640
when you look at how the project is formed or organized it has besides all

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,359
these different people who are contributing in various

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,560
ways we have these functional teams that help support it by um

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,720
we might have a secure or we do have a security team release engineering

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,119
cluster admin uh documentation and so that allows for

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,079
individuals to contribute with um either using their experience and

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,520
expertise or if they want to learn um

00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,720
a new area they can be involved that way too

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,040
it is collaborative and we do have a consistent release model which really

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,200
makes it easier for corporations who are using freebsd

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,640
and we do follow the principle of least astonishment

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,400
philosophy that it's basically don't break things at work already

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,359
this is a way um it's really simplified visualization of how the uh how the

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,359
community or project is organized and you can see here on the top that the

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,000
foundation and the project are totally separate

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,280
uh organizations and then you have the core team and then you have all those

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,400
functional teams underneath some reasons for people to

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,839
contribute to freebsd and to the project it's it is

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,480
an inclusive and welcoming community it's a great way to learn systems

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,560
programming and study operating systems and then because

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,319
we are a smaller project then it allows for you to make a

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,359
contribution that can actually make a notable impact to the project

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,040
we do still have some of the original bsd developers

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,240
from berkeley who were students back then

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,280
and um as well some of the free bsd founders

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
and they are all approachable which makes it great

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:23,119
and it is democratically run so how how do we stay sustainable it

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,040
you know people still getting more contributors and we're

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,359
always working on that companies uh getting them to recognize the value

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,920
of open source and if they are using

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,079
freebsd to um to encourage them to give back

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,920
either financially or to uh you know with their code up

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,839
streaming their code and finally with with financial

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,760
contributions from corporations from individuals

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,200
is the way that we're able to fund projects going forward

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,400
so if you want to find out more about freebsd i would say

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,480
suggest you go to freebsd.org which is the project's website

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,800
or freebsdfoundation.org and um and i'm also open to questions if you

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,839
want to post those later so thank you very much

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,480
and up next we have brian douglas

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,240
yes brian we can hear you okay cool yeah so i'm talking about my path to open

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
source um and i'm just going to jump right in

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,359
i'm brian douglas bdougie everything you didn't know about me is

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,000
in the bottom right hand corner that's my twitter handle

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,400
so those will be my details i'm not going to go into presentation mode

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,680
it's going to be a pretty short talk and my slides are linked so if you want the

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,200
full screen version just download the slides uh but my open

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,000
source journey actually started about uh back in 2015. um i had an idea for a

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
project me and a couple other people we wanted

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,960
to auto invite people to a slack room uh this was something that slack did not

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
have built in by the faults and there are another

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,960
other tools out there for that i was lucky enough to find an open source

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,319
solution for this built in node.js the only problem was i

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,280
didn't know how to write javascript or node

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,480
so the cool thing about this i found a solution i reached out to the maintainer

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,760
by just going to the project and going to the repo

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,480
and emailing them directly because i didn't know how open source work i know

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,200
we've had a couple talks about onboarding open source shout out

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,359
to git labs talk around merge um i've got what they call them

00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
merge guides or something like that but yeah it sounds like a really awesome

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,079
program i could definitely use that five years

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,680
ago uh and even today and uh i say this because this

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,040
maintainer was nice enough to actually teach me how to do node.js teach me how

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,920
to use their project and teach me all about the community

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,960
itself uh and the beauty of that is this person was based in la but

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,760
he was traveling in thailand for a k-pop concert

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,960
uh so this is actually a screenshot of me and him chatting about how to teach

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,640
me how to do node which is super awesome today i work at

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,000
this company called github you probably have heard of it github.com

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,119
if you haven't heard of it and there i like to say i'm a beyonce

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,720
advocate um truly i'm a b i'm a developer advocate

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,200
but i like to compare myself beyonce because i'm a fan

00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,599
also beyonce is a fan of her fans and uh she goes to bat for the hive and that's

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,240
what i do and i always constantly try to look for

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,920
ways to encourage people to open source i was just in a twitter conversation

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,680
today where i'm gonna be mentoring somebody to show them how the basics of git

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,880
so wherever i can pay forward my experience

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,200
i'm always looking for that um but a couple years ago i had an idea of

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,880
i always want to get into open source but there's never really like a straight

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,599
path to get there every time i find a project

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,480
i have no idea where to start the contributing md is not the best

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,480
place to always find the information and sometimes information is lost in

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,800
context which i like to make the joke if you

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,480
don't got sauced then you lost gucci mane godfather of trap music if

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,599
you haven't heard of it um you know listen at your own discretion

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,839
it's not the best music for everybody but

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,400
he has a really good quote from an interview he did uh back in 2008

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,079
so first question i asked is how do i get involved in this project

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,200
uh as i mentioned contributing.md is a good place to start

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,240
uh in different other forms like you can actually

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,599
find whatever the entry point is sometimes the docs uh definitely the

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,839
best place to start first i highly recommend if you have open source

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,640
projects make it very clear where people can go

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,440
to be onboarded asynchronously um but recently i tried to contribute to

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,760
this project called graphical which is a way to consume your graphql apis and

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,280
sort of testing environments and i found that really quickly what

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,400
wasn't listed in the contributing md was the fact they had a discord the

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
discord was a place where those conversations happen

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,240
where you make the connections you get the free mentorship and um

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,119
so i built a little tool a couple years ago when i was discovering how to get

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,240
into open source consistently called open suaced right

00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,800
now it is a discord uh we have a community i do a couple

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,599
amas i like to uh chat with people and share

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,040
the secret sauce of how to get open source so uh if you have friends or if

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,359
you are interested involved open source uh reach

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,880
out to me on twitter um and i could share tools and links and

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,400
stuff like that and uh i'll just end with don't get lost

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,720
stay saucy and uh thank you very much for bearing

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,200
with the technical difficulties and staying over

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,599
a few minutes even though it uh time ended roughly six minutes ago

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:27,440
i'm b dougie on github and i'm bdougieyo on twitter thank you

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,520
