Description: 
	Open collaboration successes and hard lessons: Practical lessons from 10 years of Eclipse Working Groups
Gaël Blondelle

Open Source is an enabler for collaboration! Easier said than done. :) In 2010, Airbus reached out to the Eclipse Foundation with an idea: Could they replicate our established governance in their own domain? This inspired a new concept: Eclipse Working Groups. Since then, we have created more than 15 working groups. Along the way, we have learned from each of them, identified different kinds of collaborations, and experienced outstanding successes as well as frustrating failures.
