Description: 
	Open collaboration successes and hard lessons: Practical lessons from 10 years of Eclipse Working Groups
Gaël Blondelle

Open Source is an enabler for collaboration! Easier said than done. :) In 2010, Airbus reached out to the Eclipse Foundation with an idea: Could they replicate our established governance in their own domain? This inspired a new concept: Eclipse Working Groups. Since then, we have created more than 15 working groups. Along the way, we have learned from each of them, identified different kinds of collaborations, and experienced outstanding successes as well as frustrating failures.

good day Thanks for attending this session in which I will give you my impressions after spending 10 years

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:18,340
of my life [indiscernible].

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,570
So I'm Gael Blondelle. I'm the vp of ecosystems development at the eclipse foundation

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,070
As you can hear I am French and I have been involved in eclipse foundation since the inception of the

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,070
concept.

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,260
I see my personal mission as helping more companies do more Open Source because I think

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,320
that you know, Open Source [indiscernible] the world.

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:53,500
So to set the context for this presentation let's have a look at what the Eclipse Foundation became of our time

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,490
it's been created in 2004, to provide vendor neutral governance and to support the Open Source

00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,790
ecosystem around the [indiscernible].

00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:12,750
Over the years we grew to be leading -- open source foundation that supports nearly 400 Open Source projects

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,380
in a community of more than 15 hundred contributor lots of contributors.

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:28,200
Eclipse projects cover various domains like enterprise [indiscernible] iut [indiscernible] artificial intelligence

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,950
we have more than 300 corporate members who

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,120
collaborate thanks to the Eclipse governance model and processes especially in the context of

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,240
working groups.

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,460
Our tag line is the community for open innovation and collaboration.

00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,760
In terms of community our eclipse [indiscernible] process and the eclipse governance

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,700
foster transparency openness and --

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,980
even if we are member-driven organization or it keeps projects and communities are open to

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,000
all individuals in the organizations I come back to that later.

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,809
We have code first meaning that we put marketing behind as we observe that our successful projects

00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:20,010
are the ones that provide good and useful code.

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,450
And finally we are commercial friendly in the ways that intellectual property affects

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:33,290
projects allows users to download the eclipse platform and use them as a foundation for their products.

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,930
So we are in the [indiscernible] part of the licensing spectrum.

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's talk about the inception of working groups at the Eclipse Foundation.

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,660
So in 2010 the eclipse foundation and airbus started to evaluate the possibility of hosting

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,520
a sub-organization and that's the governance of the foundation.

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,960
The goal was to avoid the cost and time required by airbus and its partners to create a new Open

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:12,580
Source foundation to [indiscernible] dedicated to embedded critical systems like fly by wire

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,440
creating a fully impressional open source foundation requires months or even years and lots of money

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:30,680
So the idea is that an Eclipse working group is a sort of foundation -- realize the existing governance and processes

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,900
and extends them with dedicated efforts to various activities like -- management

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,780
open specification, brand management, shared marketing activities

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,460
and in some cases co-development.

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,420
Those executions with others and others led to the creation of PolarSys.

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,360
The first functional eclipse working group dedicated to open source tools for --

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Perhaps this was user driven meaning that user define requirements and coordinates and

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:14,660
the road map and some of those users some founding members were Ericsson and Airbus.

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,540
Some of those goals were very long-term support with target of 40 to 60 years of support for

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,500
tools used in energy or aerospace industry.

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,800
and so another goal was to ease tools qualification and certification

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,300
for usage in aeronautics space and automotive.

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:45,340
That was not enough diversity of members and lack of industry leadership and always a divergence

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:53,100
of 2 competing projects we ended up with terminating the working group in 2018.

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,940
That said, we learned a lot from this experience

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,080
especially that collaboration is never easy, surprise.

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,260
So two main important reasons for us is

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,420
that it helps us design a better approach to working groups

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:22,700
and the technology side it contributed lots of improvements to [indiscernible] and

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:31,060
other parts of Eclipse's modern projects that are still very important in the Eclipse ecosystem today.

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:39,760
the same years -- the Eclipse iot working group was created.

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,300
interestingly the full initiative was addressing topics not related to tools at all.

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:51,300
That was not the first time the Eclipse Foundation had projects not related to active development tools

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,090
but that was certainly interesting to see a new community standing on the shoulders

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,520
of the eclipse governance to create a technical ecosystem for an iot stack

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,720
The approach was code first -- driven with several actors who had been involved

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,100
previously with the eclipse development process

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,420
and recognized the importance of rigorous and sometimes boring --

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,100
transparent development process and balance governance between

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,060
interest of corporations and developers.

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,759
The success of this initiative with several projects like [indiscernible]

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:42,870
that are ever used for -- for example or -- as a framework for gateways led to a strategic move from

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,680
-- to the fact that they increased their leadership

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,200
globally in Eclipse and more specifically in Eclipse iot working group in 2015.

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,040
And I would like to

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:05,020
to give this quote from Stefan Ferber our champion at Bosch the CEO at Bosch IO

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,300
that no company can realize the IoT on its own

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,080
and that bosch joined eclipse iot because within the eclipse community

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,300
through the contribution of many iot developers

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,680
tools and standards are created on an open platform that many companies can benefit from for their

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,340
IoT applications.

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,480
So over the years

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,300
the eclipse iot working group attracted projects that cover all the functional concerns

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,060
of IoT from managing very small devices

00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,360
to connecting that the cloud including some IoT gateways and digital

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,260
in between platforms.

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,340
After 8 years of existence

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,180
the working group has now more diversity in membership with large organizations

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,960
more organizations and also start-ups

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,380
and it also managed to -- complimentary between potentially competing projects.

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,860
And finally it established the eclipse foundation as a key player for IoT and Open Source.

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:18,560
So in 2020, we have 8 million lines of code, 45 projects

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,740
more than 350 contributors and 45 member organizations.

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,620
And one of the most recent initiatives is the creation of Eclipse IoT packages

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,800
to foster -- and synchronous release of subsets of projects in the working group.

00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:42,360
So Eclipse IoT demonstrates that our code first approach works

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,360
and that initiatives that makes -- proud champions with some corporate strategies

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,640
build successful Open Source eco systems.

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,460
My third example is jakarta ee our biggest initiative in terms of working groups

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,960
so in 2017, that's what we have on this photo

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:22,520
-- with partners like IBM [indiscernible]

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,940
Java EE would become true Open Source at the Eclipse Foundation.

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,620
We had to rename it to not use the term Java

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,300
and the community choose jakarta as a new name for this initiative.

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,600
and the initiative came with several challenges

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,780
moving a large code base including the standard apis --

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,040
reference implementation so that's something like 50 projects

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,920
almost 140 git repositories more than 50 [indiscernible]

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,459
and more than 60 million lines of code.

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,480
So creating an open alternative to the jira community process

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,280
to manage the standards and finally

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,560
working with vibrant communities of that grown over 20 years

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,080
as well as with large and smaller software companies.

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:27,680
High level roadmap was quickly published and that helped to stay connected with different stakeholders

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,540
and also to address impressions of the most enthusiastic members of the community.

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,960
Indeed the creation of Jakarta EE was expected by lots of people and organizations who were

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,940
frustrated by the previous status quo.

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,790
But even with a strong commitment from -- leading organizations it took longer than initially

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,580
expected to move to a really Open Source ecosystem.

00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,500
One of the main activities was

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,340
to develop the eclipse foundation specification process

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,920
to replace the Java committee process in Jakarta EE.

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,160
so we adapted our eclipse development process

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,140
And eclipse specifications are managed in a similar way as Open Source projects

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:26,440
but with a particular of care of managing the in take property flows in a way that is compatible with the creation of open standards.

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,740
And that's not necessarily easy I can tell you.

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:39,820
And we also add at some point to enable individuals to participate to specification process

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,660
based on their merits.

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:53,620
So we took care that this process is well established open process to create open standards

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,579
that it complies with all the rules that makes it possible to use those open standards and

00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:06,860
for companies to contribute to those open standards, but we also managed to involve

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,360
individuals to participate in the process.

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,440
An important thing to mention is that from the beginning the leading organizations committed

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,040
the necessary financial resources to allow the eclipse foundation to build the dedicated team.

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,520
It was necessary to address one of the big topics of Jakarta EE is the fact that

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,320
technology compatibility kit become Open Source and that everybody can contribute to improve it

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,780
very good news for the community but not easy as it also means that

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,100
-- was transferred to the working group

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,040
and this requires significant release engineering and thought

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,700
as well as significant hardware resources to run it.

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,759
As you can see on this slide the Jakarta team so invested lots of efforts in relationship

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,220
with the community in term of openness and transparency.

00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:16,120
And to engage with the community the working group participated in numerous developer conferences

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:25,120
and also started to create its own online events Jakarta live stream events Jakarta 1 life stream events

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:33,660
we had the first Jakarta One live stream in September 2019 with 1,400 attendees

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,520
and since then we also launched regional events

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,220
with long range specific events like Jakarta one live steam Japan

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,960
and more recently Jakarta one live stream --

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,380
finally we regularly create new community outreach programs for example we sponsor

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,040
the crowd cast account for virtual meet-ups organized by the Java user groups

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
and that's been very successful since last March.

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:14,180
So key successes from jakarta ee has been to establish and be able to communicate

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:22,240
clear goals and to also put together different industry datas to achieve a common objective.

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:29,040
To establish credibility for the brand and also to establish the open specification process with

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,760
input from all the stakeholders.

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:40,320
The lesson learned is that transferring important intellectual property can be complex,

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,660
challenging and that it takes time.

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,820
Attracting new participant members requires also time and deliberate effort.

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,940
Transparency is key, it's important.

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,520
It has been success in Jakarta but it takes effort.

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:07,600
And also using all the possible channels to engage the community is really important.

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,620
Before jumping into my conclusions I would like to tell the story of

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,280
Eclipse automotive working groups.

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:25,690
So first we created an Eclipse automotive working group in 2010, with a focus on building

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,480
a common Eclipse tooling platform for the automotive industry to integrate some

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,580
domain specific standards like -- to hopefully avoid

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,400
the redevelopment of common features we can say to avoid when inventing the wheel which is interesting in automotive

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,460
but we had at the time not enough traction and not enough focus

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,480
so not enough investments from the members.

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,010
So we it failed due to the lack of joint vision by the members.

00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,910
But then we still add lots of connections to automotive and then we realized that smaller

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,100
more focused working group could work better.

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:17,760
And according to -- we received Nobel Prize of economy for our work and management of the commons

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,560
more focus and collaborate with more clearly defined boundaries and effective monitoring

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,149
of progress and shorter processes for corrective choices.

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:37,460
So over the years we implemented this model on smaller working groups with open mdm

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:46,620
for the management of data from test and diagnosis open pass that's similar test of automotive systems

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,740
open edx to integrate 2 chains for the development of autonomous vehicles and more working groups.

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:06,439
And now almost ten-year later we are back thinking about more ambitious plan to maybe

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:12,450
setup an umbrella with the -- initiative.

00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:19,700
That's what I like in this story is that potentially ten years ago

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:28,060
creating the Eclipse automotive working group we had not enough common goals to make it successful.

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:36,560
And in between by going through smaller initiative we have now in a more --

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:45,400
ecosystem for that potentially inadverts the creation of such an eclipse automotive initiative

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,340
So stay tuned.

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,680
I just mentioned few Eclipse working groups but you can see here that we have

00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
15 active working groups.

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,800
And I can tell you that we work on the creation of and -- more working groups.

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:11,320
So they all share some common characteristics so they use similar Open Source licensing model

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,120
based on business friendly intellectual property management.

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,550
They use the same project development process to coordinate activities.

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:25,180
They use the same governance model to ensure a level playing field for all participants.

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,760
And they get this out of the box as part of building their working group inside the Eclipse foundation

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:42,000
And on top of this common layer the build marketing activities, the -- advocacy,

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,500
test capabilities and more depending on their needs and ambition.

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,320
On our side even if we see that each working group is different.

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,580
We managed to put together a process that we customize for each working group

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:12,220
whether it is user driven or technology driven, whether it's a large initiative like Jakarta or a smaller initiative

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,200
and whether its an established communities such as routine for safe place to collaborate

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,800
or new community in a new domain.

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:28,980
And in terms of lesson learned, so

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,420
we think that successful working groups require dedicated staff.

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,890
You absolutely need a program manager to coordinate all the activities.

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:48,170
You need some time from our IP infrastructure, release engineering and web team.

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,790
And also at some point you need a marketing coordinator as soon as the group wants to

00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:01,420
participate to conferences to organize events, to create promotion material like use cases

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,700
success stories, or other marketing -- to help grow the community.

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,140
And if you want to attract developers like if you produce APIs or standards

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,020
you need a developer advocate and potentially developer advocacy program, i care, champion program

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,900
to recruit champions in the domain.

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,720
So more lessons learned is that copyright collaboration is not easy

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,700
surprise that requires constant effort and championship.

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,480
um you have to invest in the relationship with the leaders and you need leaders at the developer level

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,860
management level and also at the top management level.

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,140
You have to value respect and engage with the community.

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,150
And so open specifications can be a key feature.

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,680
I'm really enthusiastic about seeing more and more open standards

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,440
that will be supported by open source implementations and will increase interoperability

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,940
and our capability to create new applications.

00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,180
One last thing

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,960
is that it's really important for me and my colleagues as staff of a non-profit open source foundation

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:32,920
to always stick to our core principles of transparency, openness and meritocracy.

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:42,780
So transparency remains at everything should be returned mailing list -- media like wiki page or forum.

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,840
Openness means that everybody can participate to an Open Source project

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,560
and meritocracy means that everybody has to demonstrate their skills and will to participate

00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:03,220
because they before they can be elected as a committer and a full members of the project.

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:14,270
So that's whether you when you implement collaborations in structures like Eclipse working groups

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:21,520
it's always important to keep that in mind for all our projects and all our working groups

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,630
that's the core principles that we apply.

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,530
Thank you.

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:33,300
And yeah, I'm looking now -- I'm now looking forward to our Q and A session.

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,640
Thanks.

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Thanks for listening um so

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,500
we have 2 questions I don't know

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:54,180
how much of the run back is defined with a volunteer community as opposed to being set by a small team of committers or project leaders.

00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,780
Yeah, that's a that's an interesting point. i think that there are

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,420
several side several side about it so

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,780
what we observed especially in Jakarta EE for example where

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,340
you know Java EE has been there for 20 years and there are plenty of

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:21,420
freelance consistent to make all the business

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,720
and Java EE and are very committed to

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,100
they're interested in Jakarta EE. so the point what's important they are very vocal.

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:40,860
So their point of view is taken into account into uh

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,500
in the road maps by the larger organizations.

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,760
But I think that's -- that's always true that the more

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,860
the brokers the company can inject in a project the more the industry gets

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,910
So yes.

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:14,270
Of course that is about -- is mainly defined by the people who will work on the project

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:24,680
and in the several examples I gave that's mostly people who work for a company and that's

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,640
part of their daily job.

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:37,360
But still I think that one of the them -- so again the project open and transparent and

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,180
even when there are some big corporations

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,180
we do everything to keep the project open and transparent

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:55,660
And so as a place for community members to -- to be -- their opinion and for example,

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:07,740
in IoT and in Jakarta we have organized -- so that's -- I think that's so good way to get

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:16,540
the feedback of the users of the technology because basically what I described here is how to use

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:25,030
Open Source to -- code promote some Open Source platforms.

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:31,140
I guess the question -- the topic -- >> I just got all the information finally

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,600
for pathable start getting their agenda together.

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:44,600
Yes if im going the road map how do we manage to do that.

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,270
Well, I guess that's -- there's no magic.

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,840
So that's one of the examples of -- at some point.

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,920
We ended up in a situation where we are lacking industry leadership.

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,600
So there was not a clear road map enough.

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,210
And on the technology side we started to have competing projects.

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:19,110
And they didn't manage to find -- to take the high road so they didn't --

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,280
they didn't invest enough in corporation.

00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,980
And basically we are just -- we just provide a framework.

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,630
We provides a framework and provide experience about how to run it.

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:41,890
But not enough collaboration not a common road map then it doesn't work.

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:50,260
That kind of answer your question of the question of maturity, I was mentioning the point of automotive

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:58,390
and in automotive I think that ten years ago Open Source in automotive alternative was new and we were

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:03,440
talking to people only interested in an Open Source

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,440
to mean bad form so mostly to call initial projects of eclipse

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:18,880
now ten years later we have more and more interest in those kind of companies and more that they have to do

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,580
autonomous driving and this kind of stuff and that's typically basis where

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,080
Open Source platforms are so of a potential

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,920
>> Yeah, just to conclude in a few words this presentation I've been attending

00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,860
lots of the presentation of the conference so far.

00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,160
seems that this presentation was certainly a bit more about

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:55,020
the corporate side and of using Open Source. That's also what I like in

00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,740
what the being done at the Open Source initiative it goes from

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:09,060
presentations extreme copyleft yesterday to this more copyright friendly collaboration.

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,260
And that's this diversitys -- best in my opinion.

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,640
Thanks.

00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,540
