so hey i'm thomas i'm co-founder of

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
raycast i'm here with

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,560
um thomas from from linear um it's a

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
similar name and we also shared a

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
passion of our developer experience so

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,320
quite happy to talk today about how to

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
prioritize the deaf experience doing

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
development

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
but before diving into our conversation

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,640
um why not introducing yourself

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,960
a little bit more to the audience

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
sure i'm i'm thomas i'm the co-founder

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
of linear

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
i used to previously be at uber i was a

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,960
staff engineer on the mobile platform

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
team

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,559
um you know looking after developer

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,879
experience uh for mobile

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,879
yeah seems like a good fit for this chat

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,399
right yeah it does it does

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
yeah so maybe why why in channel like

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,640
just

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,399
like developer experience is just a

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
fussy term like but why should you

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,199
really care about this stuff

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
and especially when you're working um in

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,560
in a product team right it's like

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
sometimes a little bit uh

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
not the usual kind of thing that you

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,960
would think about

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,960
yeah i mean it really depends on on

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,479
you know what developer experience means

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,880
means to you like um

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
as a as a term it essentially means you

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
know the experience

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
you have when you develop things um

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
which means you know

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,119
usually that things just go fast and

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,119
don't go into your way and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
you're you're able to concentrate on on

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
you know just building whatever

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
whatever you're doing but i think

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
there's there's multiple layers um

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
to developer experience um and i think

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,360
the the important one um

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,520
to to to realize is that

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,560
it's it's really a means to an end like

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
you should not

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
um focus on developer experience without

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
really realizing

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,240
why you're doing it um obviously it's

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
it's it's good to have you know fun

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,320
and um be able to engineer in a place

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
where um

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,680
everything feels good and you're able to

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
to focus on things but

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
in the end it's about building product

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
um the faster you can you know

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
the more time you can spend build build

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
products the better

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
the the better your developer experience

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
is to me

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
means um the more time you can you can

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
spend on

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,360
um on building up the product and maybe

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,640
as a side product you get sort of more

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
happy engineers

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
because they can do what they enjoy

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
doing they don't have to wait for

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,720
you know two hour builds um you know

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
linter will take care of all these you

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,920
know awkward

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,840
um uh discussions about you know how to

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,160
format your code

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
and um you know the it feels that the

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,519
system is there to to help you um just

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,840
be a better engineer

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
yeah no discussions about taps or spaces

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,959
or two spaces of course yeah

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
yeah yeah that is um

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
how do you feel about it so i see it

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
kind of as a spectrum

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,840
so i mean in the ideal world you want to

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
build a product as quick as possible

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
and without any box right but the

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
reality we all know it's completely

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,760
different and it isn't that simple

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
so i see it usually you can spend a lot

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
of time to make something

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
easy to build which then brings you

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
quicker to to your solution

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,480
but that may be also lead to potential

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
bucks and at the end

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,400
and that leads to unhappy developers

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,560
because i mean nobody really likes

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
fixing box right um

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
and then the other extreme is you want

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,640
to make it extremely secure so you're

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,640
almost

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,400
not introducing any box or security

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
issues but that makes it maybe really

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
hard and cumbersome to build

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
which and also leads to unhappy

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
developers because um

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
i mean we all want to ship code as quick

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,159
as possible and get our products in

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
front of the users

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,599
so i kind of i kind of think about

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
developers being as a spectrum

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
and you kind of need to find the sweet

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
spot

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
um for the product and for the team and

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
i think that's different as well because

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,560
um if you work in a finance company you

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
probably care about about security stuff

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
that uh

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
not suddenly millions of dollars go

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
somewhere emitting

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
um but if you work on a product team on

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,959
a consumer thing you may be fine with

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,120
the one or

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
other smaller block and can and it's

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,319
more important for you to to outpace

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
your competitor and your

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,239
pay a little bit more attention on how

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,560
to make developers faster to get there

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
and this can change over time right so

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,400
you may be in different phases

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,799
like okay we have to go from zero to one

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,359
so okay we find having some issues but

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,519
then

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,960
we uh change it over time to make it

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,800
more secure

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
right that's super interesting that you

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
know we have such differing

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
you know initial ideas on what developer

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
experience means

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,360
um if if you could give sort of a

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
concrete example of

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
you know you mentioned security

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,800
developer experience

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
you know making sure that you know your

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
your application that you're building

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,800
secure like how

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
can you give me an example of what what

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,680
that means like what kind of system

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
would ensure that

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
yeah so at regulars for example we think

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
about

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,400
when we build something up front like

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,639
how much we want to invest into it is it

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
something fundamental to the product

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,759
um then we invest a lot into it to make

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
it just

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
um secure the bill that we don't that we

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
know no bucks popping up or spend a

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,639
little bit more time and we know we're

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,479
building on top of that later

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,479
so we want to make it easy to build and

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,919
make sure this is a rock solid thing

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,199
versus there are sometimes this one-off

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,880
solution but you know you're building

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,400
that thing but you won't touch it like

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,919
for the next several months

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,759
so you can be a little bit more lacks on

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,880
that um and can say okay it works like

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
that i don't need this massive

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,919
obstructions and being pragmatic in this

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
way

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
um to make it like faster to ship this

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
product

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
um and i think that you can see that in

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
various decisions when you do that

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
and for us for example we took early on

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
we have

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
we're releasing every week so we want to

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
make it

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
um less painful to release every week

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
like pretty much you run a script and

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,479
and the update goes out to our users

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,000
without um

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,600
us being involved and it wasn't so

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
smooth at the beginning so we invested

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
into it especially when we got the

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
bigger team

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to make it smoother that this doesn't

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,759
happen too often this thing fails um

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
and and that's this is what we do there

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,840
quite often um

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,280
yeah so we have something similar yeah

00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,919
no we we're really talking about the

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,240
same thing

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,680
um like you're talking like in the end

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,479
everything that matters is sort of

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,319
friction

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
being able to not think about things

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
like um if you have

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
a system you know for example we have an

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
abstraction on top of our database

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
access in order to make sure that

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,680
you don't accidentally touch you know

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
another workspace's um data

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
um and that's a good example of you know

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
uh

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
having a good developer experience

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
around um

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,280
data access having linters to prevent

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,360
you from making mistakes

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
so that literally you you can't really

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
make mistakes you just

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,400
you know follow follow the pattern that

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,199
is in the application and um if you do

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
something wrong

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,240
um you you'll get notified by the

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
lyncher that you know you probably

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
shouldn't be doing this or if you if you

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,560
want to do this

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,759
um please sort of remove the linter from

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
this file because you're doing something

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,039
dangerous

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
um in the end it's it just you know

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,759
takes away

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
the the need to um look at your code

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
um you know or uh yeah

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
take a take a second look at your code

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
in order to make it secure um

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
you have essentially some sort of

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
automation on top of

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
your code to make things easier to ship

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
yeah you mentioned the

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,880
prevention i think that is actually the

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,880
key here right so

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,120
you won't prevent that something happens

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
um so either way we use a ton of linters

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
for this kind of stuff

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,680
or also extractions that goes as you

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
mentioned with the database you're

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,720
building something on top

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,120
that makes it easier to use that you

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,440
prevent a misuse of what on

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
otherwise would have been possible and i

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,319
think a lot of the times like that

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
but it also sometimes you have to see

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
the bug first

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,520
before you're fixing it right so we um

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
sometimes in the situation you see

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
something

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
but more often and then then we look how

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
we can prevent it

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
come up with a solution and then usually

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
applying the solution to the entire code

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,000
base

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,479
um to also make sure that other passes

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
that maybe use a certain misbehavior

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,360
getting ironed out over time

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
yeah yeah they're um you know especially

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
when we when

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,039
we go into talking about you know how

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
what the difference is in developer

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
experiences

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
is between startups and then big

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,919
companies that we've both both been part

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,520
of

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,039
um i think there's there's also an

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
aspect that you have to have to

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,800
um you know think about especially when

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
you when you go into bigger companies um

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
in small companies you know developer

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
experience can feel like

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
um it's uh it's something that that you

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,599
know

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
should be there that that helps you um

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,160
guide you know you of of not making

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
mistakes

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
but the big companies where where

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,199
there's you know so many rules

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
um and so many people that have made a

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,879
mistake that you know

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
somebody has now an interlinter in there

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,000
it almost feels like policing um

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,240
in some sort of way and it becomes um

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,919
you know an annoying thing um so so

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,159
maybe that's a good good segue into

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
into sort of going into talking about um

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,200
you know what's the difference between

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
developer experience at big companies

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,279
versus versus small companies how

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,320
how did facebook um you know do things

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
on that front

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah so before co-founding raincoast i

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,880
worked at facebook as a software

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,279
engineer

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,200
um and facebook they're quite famous for

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,519
having like a lot of developer tools

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
um and i think every bigger corporation

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
has this dedicated teams that

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
doing nothing else than improving the

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,440
speed of development

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,200
um and so what their engineers are doing

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,880
basically they're looking into building

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,880
frameworks or even

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,640
sometimes programming languages or to

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
really uh make a difference

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
in the speed um mostly and then also

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,600
later on the security layers

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
um and typical examples are like hack

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
for php development

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,720
flow which there was the attempt to to

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
make a typescript

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,600
kind of like thing for javascript and

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,920
then um react is also came out of that

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,279
i was never part of such a team so i was

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,640
always on the other side and was

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
enjoying that

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,760
so i was enjoying what all all the teams

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,279
came up with

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
and for me as a developer it was great

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,279
because it helped me just

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
shipping things faster and being

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,480
confident that

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,600
i do the right thing and part of that is

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,560
yeah internal tooling like cli tools to

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
um um yeah to to communicate with the

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,320
source control and but also then

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,000
loads of lenders that we're running all

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,839
the time um

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
and i think one thing that facebook did

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,079
quite well is

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
value developer experience so if i as an

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
engineer make

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,079
other engineers on my team more

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
productive they value that in

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,360
performance reviews

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
so this helped basically everybody

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,640
thinking about how can i make my team

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,880
more productive

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
and for me that was i built internal

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,839
tools to quickly access information for

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
example

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
downloading builds quicker that i need

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,440
to debug um and then my team could use

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
that to be to be faster

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
um and then basically sharing that with

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
the team but

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
now when you're in a small company you

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,320
obviously don't have such a

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,640
such a dedicated team that looks off the

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,279
developer developer experience and it's

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,240
more of

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,519
a shared responsibility um for us it's a

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
lot more ad hoc

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
as i mentioned before we look basically

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,120
and see where we

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
need to apply a little bit more where we

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,920
need to apply a little bit less where we

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
need to fix something

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,000
and then uh we are doing that for

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
reoccurring bucks and thinking how we

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,959
can

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,120
prevent certain things um how was it at

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,160
uber was it like similar dedicated teams

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,160
and so on

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,440
oh it was yeah for sure like at some

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,600
point um

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
you grow so big that you know you have

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
to have dedicated teams in order to

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
you know cover cover all the ground that

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,160
you know other people don't don't have

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
time for um because in

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
in some respect like when you get to an

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
organization where you have

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,200
like even at uber i think we have 20

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,360
teams doing mobile work

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
um and all these teams are incentivized

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
you know very differently like they

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
um most of them are product teams so

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,560
they ship product they they want to make

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,640
sure that a feature works and

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
um they don't really care too much or

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,399
they're not too

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,360
incentivized to um to sort of do

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
anything else than that

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,320
it's a different kind of developer right

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
they're thinking in different problem

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
spaces

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,000
exactly exactly yeah so um

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,120
yeah we needed a team that you know then

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,120
then looked um

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
as we saw it looked after them um to

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
make sure that they didn't make any

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
mistakes and

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
you know we get into the aspect of

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
policing um

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
sometimes they they really didn't like

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
you know what we were doing um

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,200
you know we we saw we saw problems like

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,279
our

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
you know one of the big um big things

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
that we did on the mobile platform team

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
was to make sure that

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,480
um when you ship the mobile application

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
it would still work it is a very

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,680
different thing than you know in in

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
web development or back-end development

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,560
like once you ship it you know

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
you can't take it back it's out there

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
forever um there's always somebody who

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
sort of downloads it from the app store

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,440
and never upgrades again

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
um so if you ship something that you

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,920
know fully breaks things

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,480
uh you you're screwed um your business

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,320
can really

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
you know take a take a big pounding um

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
because you know suddenly you have to

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,279
have to uh make sure that everybody

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
upgrades well how do you do that if you

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,079
don't have something in the system that

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,440
makes sure that you know people people

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,519
are forced to upgrade

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,040
um so so much of our work was to make

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,760
sure that you know everything is secure

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,320
and good

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,600
um and in in some respects like you know

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
it's it's both sides of

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
of sort of the developer experience coin

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
like we

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,920
we make sure that you know nobody can

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,440
make mistakes but at the same time we're

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,839
sort of enforcing rules

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
down people's throats you're playing the

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,800
black cop and just

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,639
in that sense exactly exactly so

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,720
um it's you know it's a fine line to to

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
tread um you know once you once you get

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
there

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
um then there's obviously you know

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
things that are that are much easier to

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
to comprehend like you know just helping

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
people um

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,240
bring down build times like we had a

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
huge dedicated team just you know

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
focusing ci making sure

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
um that we intelligently run you know

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,920
all the unit tests that that needed to

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
run

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,360
um and all the ui tests that needed to

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
run um and nothing else so that you

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,839
could get you know

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,360
your pull request landed much much

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,040
faster um

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
or you know build an experimentation

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
system that would you know automatically

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
turn off features when they when they

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,320
started crashing um you know helped

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,680
everybody

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,360
people didn't have to wait they have to

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,720
be woken up at night so

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,560
that's very um you know not

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
non-controversial um

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
but um it you know it required a

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,639
dedicated team to to go after these

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,480
initiatives because um you know the

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
other teams

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
didn't really have the incentives to to

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
you know fix things obviously there were

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,920
um

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,320
you know you still had uh you know

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,959
some sort of incentive um in in sort of

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,560
uh you know the um

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
the quarterly and half yearly uh

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
performance reviews were

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
um if you were able to demonstrate that

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,440
you you know fix things for the entire

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
company or all the mobile engineers um

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
you know you

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,480
you were treated um well as well and you

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
you did get appreciation for that

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,160
um but it was pretty rare that that

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,399
other people sort of you know took big

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,240
um big big things up to heart and and

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,199
then fixed fixed things for for many

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
many engineers

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
like one thing that is interesting here

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
is like it's all um

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,920
internal developer experience right

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
because um

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,519
i think there's also the separation

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
between internal developer experience

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,279
versus external developer experience

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,279
especially for companies that providing

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,440
an api you certainly don't

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,959
need only to think about the developers

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
that you have in the company but also

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,079
folks that are outside and building on

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
top of it which i think is a completely

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
different

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,480
problem because you maybe don't even

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
know what they're going to build um so

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
internally you have

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
a better understanding i assume um for

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,160
for what people are building and how you

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
can solve them and how you can improve

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
and

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,920
you're working basically more closely

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,880
with your customer in this sense

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,440
together right

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
was that something that also um helped

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
with

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,040
with planning inside of uber because you

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
were so close to

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
the people that you're improving right

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,360
they're basically sitting almost next to

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,480
you

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,079
um yes sure like um you could always go

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
out and ask you know what's your biggest

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,760
problem and you know what can i do for

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
you

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,839
real time all the time right

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,519
so we we did that um you know we did

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
send a questionnaire out every every

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
every quarter um asking you know here's

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
here's

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,600
problems that we think are important

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
like just rate them like what is your

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
biggest pain point like what what is

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
what is

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
holding you down what is you know

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,880
slowing you slowing you down

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
and after a certain time like you know

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
you didn't have to ask

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,519
because you sort of need like that the

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,720
same problems were very consistent

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,839
across like you know uh

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,839
slow build times um ui tests you know

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,279
horribly slow um you know literally

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,920
anything that just

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
make you wait um that's i think the gist

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,959
of it like if you have to wait for for

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,160
the computer to do something like that

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
that's the first developer experience

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
that you can have if things just go and

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,079
and you know work out fine without

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,440
you having to wait for it um you have a

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,600
good developer experience

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,600
yeah yeah there was also this this

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
constant push at facebook to

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,519
get your changes like quick as quick as

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
possible into production especially on

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
the web right where this is

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,800
where this is better possible and they

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
started with like having

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
i don't know daily or weekly um cuts

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
where they basically

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
change the website but then in the end

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,560
it trimmed it down to i think hourly or

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,079
something so

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,320
everything that went into this hour was

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,079
then automated tested

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
um so if there were regressions if not

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,680
then this thing basically goes out

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,759
so literally by the time you're landing

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,519
you commit um an hour later although

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,519
it is in production um which is all

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
handled by machines that no developer

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
has to care about that right so

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,399
obstructing a huge part which otherwise

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
you would need to go back and see and

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,560
push

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,959
to make that as seamless as possible

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,880
which

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,160
you know from a startup's perspective

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,519
sounds like um

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,880
sounds like a bad thing to have to wait

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,160
for an hour for your video

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
i guess once you understand like you

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,079
know if you have you know thousands of

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
engineers doing doing changes with

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,280
you know hundreds and hundreds of

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,079
back-end systems sort of working in

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,240
tandem

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,439
um being able to ship every hour is is

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,760
quite amazing um

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,640
you know at that scale um but obviously

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
you know startups

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,720
um you know usually ship continuously

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,360
you land something production it goes

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120
out and

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,120
um you know hopefully it's at least a

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,400
bit tested um you know before it ships

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,080
and then comes back

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
but that you know sort of the the the

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,880
other side of the coin like you know if

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,799
you if i compare uber to

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
um to to startups like everywhere you

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,799
have this dedicated team and

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
um in in startups you really don't like

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,240
i think it's

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,840
it's everybody's um responsibility to

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
make sure that the developer experience

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,440
is

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,679
good and um it is

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
you know i think it's it's not really a

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,440
trade like you shouldn't think of it as

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
a trade-off like i'm i'm trading of my

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
time of building the product into making

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,160
making sure that the developer

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
experience is good like i think it's

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
again like it it is the thing that you

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,480
do in order to be able to build a good

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
product

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,360
you have to figure out like you know

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
what what are the things that are

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,799
holding you

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,679
you up and if it if it takes less time

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,640
to fix it

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,919
for everybody um than it is to just sort

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
of keep on struggling with the issue

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,280
then then you should do it

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,640
uh but if not then then probably not at

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,480
the start up like you're still link

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
you're still trying to you know figure

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,360
out what you're building and you're

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,000
still trying to

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,480
get your product market fit so you

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
shouldn't spend time on things that

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,679
really don't help you with with that

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
goal um but if there's

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,200
if there's things that you know slow you

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
down or slow the company down

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,320
um more than it takes for for you to fix

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,799
it and you definitely should

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
yeah do you have any specific kind of

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,799
planning or browsers like linear to do

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,400
that

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,799
um i i don't think we like

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
yeah like maybe if it becomes a too big

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,240
of an issue like you know

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
when when when when you start getting

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
annoyed by it and you don't have the

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
time

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,600
yeah like the bigger things right which

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,280
i like exactly

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
just longer than just like a couple of

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
hours but maybe need weaker though to

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
work on yeah

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
and then you then you raise it up with

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,039
everybody else and sort of try to figure

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,520
out whether whether it's a

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,039
big enough issue to to to fix because

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
like you you realize that you know maybe

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
you're

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
you're burdened by it but maybe nobody

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
else has has the same same kind of

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
problem

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
but at the same time like you want to

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
make you know other people aware of of

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
you know problems that exist with double

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,720
experience so that everybody

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,520
sort of is on on the same um same level

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,679
with you and

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,960
knows what what the problems are um and

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
then you know people can in their in

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,760
their minds

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,200
prioritize and uh you know figure out if

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,160
they hit the same problem then they know

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,240
that you know it's

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,280
it's a bigger thing than you know just

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,120
themselves um

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,960
being being hit with it yeah one thing

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,400
we've been doing at rayquaza we did

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,880
twice so far was

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
kind of like a week long of a bug bash

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
like initially

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,160
more to fix smaller things but but also

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
is a good time to just look around like

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
what were things that you wanted to do

00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
for a while

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
or the code that you wanted to clean up

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,360
or remove or the thing that

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,640
um need a little bit more polishing um

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,600
so that

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,039
i think we do more recurrently now um

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,880
because everybody is happy when you can

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,240
go back to something and make it a

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,120
little bit prettier than you left it

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
right

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,320
yeah yeah yeah we so we we do hack weeks

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
as well and

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,760
um you know most of the well not most

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
but you know

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,000
60 of the projects are are you know

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,679
user-facing features that people want to

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
want to build but then the rest is

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,679
developer experience things so if you if

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,520
you if you're able to give you know your

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,720
your engineers the time to to fix

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,039
anything and fix

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
whatever um i think you know they'll

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
find the right balance between

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,919
you know shipping some cool features

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,320
that they always wanted to do um

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,520
and as opposed to um fixing things that

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,520
have really bugged them

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
in in the developer experience yeah so

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,480
if you just give them

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
give them the time they'll they'll sort

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,640
of at some point gravitate towards those

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
dev experience um things if it's a big

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
enough problem for them

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,919
yeah because it affects them directly

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,600
right day-to-day so

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,120
um obviously you want to fix the things

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
that holding you back

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,559
yeah for sure so what's if you had to

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,679
choose you know

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,919
um one thing in in your in your past

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
you know half a year um yeah if that

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,960
that you or your team has fixed for

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,440
developer experience

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,720
what what would that be oh good good

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,039
point yeah

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,360
um i i i named two

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,960
so two what one is just this ongoing

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,440
thing with release automation which we

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
have

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,880
um it is simple but they sometimes fail

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,520
so you want to make that smooth because

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,919
we have this weekly on-call rotation um

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,760
so

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,520
once a week one engineer is responsible

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,799
to do the release and it should be as

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
simple as possible

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,520
and it works quite well but then at some

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,919
point we had to do multiple builds for

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,360
m1 and all the different architectures

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,799
that we need to support so it becomes

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,000
more flaky because you just need to

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,000
build more stuff

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,360
um so we ironed that out and made it

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,039
easier to use um

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,400
so for for the developer it's really

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,080
just running a script

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,760
and then it really dries automatically

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,760
and so on and so forth

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
and i think that helps because it just

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
hold doesn't hold you back when you're

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,799
on core because otherwise you have this

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,280
one day in the week where

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,039
you have to cross your fingers and hope

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,200
that everything goes smoothly because

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,720
otherwise your day is ruined by fixing

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
and seeing what what the hell is going

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,200
on on the ci

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,880
so i think that is a shared thing that

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
helps everybody um

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
another thing which um we dived into

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,320
initially and that sound that sounds

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,799
small is actually huge and you maybe

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400
have

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,000
seen something similar linear is like

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
handling keyboard shortcuts can actually

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,559
become

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,000
really painful when you have different

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,000
keyboard layouts

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
so we thought okay that's easy and

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
shipped the first version and like

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,039
people came back oh my keyboard layout

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,840
doesn't work at all and then we fix that

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,000
and then the next keyboard layout came

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,280
and so we put a lot of effort into this

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
infrastructure because it's just

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,840
fundamental for our app it's very

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,080
keyboard driven

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
um so now a developer shouldn't really

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,679
care about

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,120
if the user has a japanese or an english

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,039
or a spanish keyboard

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,280
um should just like define what they

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,039
want um which was a big surprise to me

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
that keyboard shortcuts are still still

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,360
still so hard to do

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,880
um and for us like what is good for us

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,280
is like being very engineering driven

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,360
team

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,559
so even one of our designers coded the

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,480
initial website

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,720
so that means like developer experience

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,360
is kind of on top of mind of everybody

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
so there isn't a much big argument

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,880
around something like if you say okay

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,080
i'm gonna improve that everybody would

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,440
probably stand next to you and say yeah

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,840
that's a great idea

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,280
it annoys me that's yeah did you have

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,640
something particular in the last couple

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,840
of months that you would say

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,000
that that's cool to share yeah i mean

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,360
you know i think it's pretty normal that

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
people go go through the through the

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,679
same thing as

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
we did like we you know we're obviously

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,120
a web app um

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,799
and so we used to have a you know we

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,039
used to use parcel as the build system

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,559
um and it sort of got annoying because

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,520
we couldn't couldn't do hot reloads

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,760
anymore

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,799
uh and um thus you know when you ever

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,559
made a client change

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,000
you you know your browser automatically

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,080
refreshed and it took like you know

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,799
three seconds to to get back to

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,880
you yeah it's exactly it's too long like

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,559
for the longest time is like that's fine

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,000
like how many how many changes do you

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,880
make or how many times do you have to do

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
that reload

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
well you know tens of thousands of times

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,720
and you know then it starts adding up

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,720
and

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
if you if you sort of count of you know

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,000
how many times you have to reload and

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,720
how much how much time you waste

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
um it's actually quite quite a lot so we

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,279
rid that our you know build system

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,039
um and um you know make pot reloading uh

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
just you know super fast where you know

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,000
when you make code changes

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,400
most of the time if you're if you're not

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
very deep in um in the code um

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,520
you just get automatic updates in in

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
real time uh for yeah

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
you can you can test things yeah i wish

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,799
we would have hot reloading on a native

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,480
app would be far away from that

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,400
technology

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,600
yeah yeah any building but our project

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,760
is fast enough to

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,080
kind of find it's not a couple of

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
seconds but yeah it's kind of fun

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
um another thing that's what's popped up

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
for me is like um

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,360
also how we call operating is design um

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,919
because we have a lot of ui

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,520
so we put it in initially support for

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
multiple themes and made it

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,799
easy to to build that even though we had

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,799
just one theme we wanted to have the

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,960
infrastructure straight there in place

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,559
because later it's really painful and

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
you kind of know at the beginning yeah

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
we want to have lighter dark scenes so

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,320
you can

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,080
think a little bit ahead and can make

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,600
your life then a lot easier by

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,679
supporting that and we did the same with

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,760
icons and and so on that we have a

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,679
strict icon and typography system to

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,720
make it really simple for developers to

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
deal with it

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,000
perfect perfect again like you know

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,559
simplicity

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
is is is the key to a good developer

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,799
experience like

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,960
if you don't have to think about it it's

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,600
just it's just awesome um i think we

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,720
have to

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
wrap things up um you know but maybe as

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,000
a last question like um

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
what would be sort of any particular you

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,919
know

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,520
advice that you would give other startup

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,120
or early stage companies

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,640
you know regarding developer experience

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,679
yeah um

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,960
i think being pragmatic um see where it

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,480
makes sense to invest and where it

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,919
doesn't make sense to invest

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
think a little bit ahead which sounds

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,400
counterproductive for account intuitive

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,320
for startup but i think you can save

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
yourself a lot of time by investing a

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
little bit

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,039
further into key elements that you have

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
um and then you can go a long way with

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,159
that

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,799
and then just being a talk things pop up

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,679
you fix

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,720
you move on um what what kind of you

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,840
think before we're wrapping it up

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,679
entirely

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,000
um i'm just just being aware of

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,080
developer experience i think um is

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,520
is is the biggest thing because you know

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,559
when when you know that you know you

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
should be

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,400
keeping tabs on on you know how well

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
you're doing on that front

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
um that that sort of gives you the

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,760
insight to uh check

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
check up on it you know regularly um and

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,960
figure out whether you should you know

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,799
really change it and and fix it up

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,000
um so if you're aware of you know issues

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,480
that people have

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
um you know that makes you prone to fix

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
them you know when

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,080
when they arise um and it you know

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,799
depending on you know if you if you if

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
you grow bigger

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,240
um you probably need to be more

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,080
systematic about that approach

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
like with a team of 10 you can still

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,799
sort of you know talk every week and

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,559
figure out you know what the biggest

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
problems are and fix them as you go

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,559
along

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,799
but if you're you know have an

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
engineering team of 20 30 um maybe doing

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,919
different

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,679
you know back end and front end then

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
maybe throw in a mobile application as

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,960
well

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,520
um you have very very you know different

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
needs

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
from developed experience and and maybe

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,799
it's good to

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,960
sort of have a more systematic approach

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
on you know asking around every quarter

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,679
um fill in a spreadsheet what the

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,360
biggest problems are

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,720
yeah scale certainly changed the matter

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,120
of experience

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,080
cool that was nice that was great thank

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:33,679
you very much

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,679
