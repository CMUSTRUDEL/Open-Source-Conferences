Title: Make your APIs Developer-friendly – Aidan Cunniffe
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	APIs are not only ‘programming interfaces’ they’re how teams split work, collaborate with one another, share capabilities, and make awesome software. Most APIs are internal and we’re all in an API relationship with other teams of developers. So let’s talk about how good API design, empathy, and modern tools can help you build better relationships with the teams around you, great APIs, and amazing products. I’ll be sharing some stories from my time in the API space, tools and practices to explore, and some slides from a few special guests. If you produce, consume or live with an API — you should definitely make time for this talk!
