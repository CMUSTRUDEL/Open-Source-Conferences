Description: 
	What is code search? Code search is an important dev tool for some of the largest and most highly respected companies and open-source organizations, but many developers have never used it before. We'll go over the history and evolution of code search, why it's becoming more popular now, and how it might help you and your collaborators become a better team of software engineers.
