Title: Is DevEx not good… because we don't want it to be? – Ellen Chisa
Publication date: 2021-04-26
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Every developer claims they want something that just works, so they can just get back to writing code. But… we love being the latest to use a new tool, take joy in debugging problems no one else can solve, and want to know how things work under the hood. Every tool claims to make our lives faster and easier, but what do we really want out of our developer experience? Maybe we do want it to be hard - just not too hard.
