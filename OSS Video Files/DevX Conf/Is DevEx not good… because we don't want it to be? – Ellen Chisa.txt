Title: Is DevEx not good… because we don't want it to be? – Ellen Chisa
Publication date: 2021-04-26
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Every developer claims they want something that just works, so they can just get back to writing code. But… we love being the latest to use a new tool, take joy in debugging problems no one else can solve, and want to know how things work under the hood. Every tool claims to make our lives faster and easier, but what do we really want out of our developer experience? Maybe we do want it to be hard - just not too hard.

hi

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,680
i'm so excited to be here today for devx

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,680
conf

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,039
today i want to talk to you about why i

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
don't think devex

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,840
is really about making it easy

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
to give you an idea of why i'm talking

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,439
about this you only really need to know

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
one thing about me

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,320
it's that i spent the last several years

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
of my life working on a programming

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
language called dark

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
dark itself was a language that was

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
cuddled coupled to its editor and its

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
infrastructure

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
but the more important thing is when you

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
spend all your time working on a

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,399
programming language

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,840
you start to think a little bit

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
differently about the tool you're

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,920
building

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
about the tools you're using to build

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
that tool and really about every other

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
developer tool you've ever worked with

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,440
and one of the things that i found

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
really interesting as i started to dig

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,039
into

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,800
all developer tools i looked at over a

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
hundred of them

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
and it turns out there's really only a

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,159
few words we use when we're talking

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,840
about them

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
almost every single tool tells you it

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
will make it easier

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,680
it will make it faster it will make it

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,400
automatic it will make it simple

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
i looked at things from application

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,520
makers to infrastructure

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
to small things that were mostly about

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,799
developer workflow

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,920
across the board the theme that keeps

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,280
coming up is we want it to be easy

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,640
and this makes a fair amount of sense so

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
stripe released the developer

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,360
coefficient report in 2018

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,880
and in it they posited that developers

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,159
are wasting a lot of time because our

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,399
tooling isn't great

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
in fact that we're wasting 300 billion

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,520
dollars worth of time because our

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
tooling isn't great and we have to work

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,399
inefficiently

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
and so when you think about that in

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
context it kind of makes sense that we'd

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
want it to be easier

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
i don't think anyone wants to be wasting

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
that much time or effort

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
but then i stopped to think about it

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
from a developer's perspective

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
to say like all right like if we wanted

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,240
to be easy and we have hundreds of tools

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
that are trying to make it easy

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
why hasn't it really gotten easier since

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,759
the beginning of my career

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,599
we're able to build more things now but

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,599
i wouldn't say i spend much less time

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
than i did

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,360
so i need to stop and think for a minute

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
about the last time

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,080
you really enjoyed writing software

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,840
i'm not saying that everyone has to say

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
this is my one and only passion i live

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
for code i record all weekend no no no

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080
this is just we do this possibly at our

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,440
job for 40 hours a week or

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
we at least like writing software enough

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
that we've come to a conference about

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
developer experience

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,920
so think about what it is that you like

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,879
about software the magic moments that

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,879
feel really good to you

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
i'll give you one of mine when i was

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,879
working on dark we got to the point

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
where a lot of people wanted to connect

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,959
to other external infrastructure as well

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,840
and i spent a bunch of time figuring out

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,480
how to connect dark to gcp's

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
um asset storage the like equivalent of

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,720
s3 but

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,239
in gcp and i did a bunch of talks and i

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,680
wrote all the sample documentation

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
and i wrote a bunch of code live to show

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
people how to do it and

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
it was great but it wasn't great because

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,040
it was easy it was

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
kind of the opposite of easy actually it

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,560
was great

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,200
because i felt like this i was typing i

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,440
was going

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
when i found a problem i could solve it

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
it was great

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
and i hope that a lot of you have felt

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,120
this feeling too and that you like

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,319
remember the time you were writing the

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
thing and it was hard but it worked out

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,720
really well

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
programmers and developers aren't the

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,159
only people who feel this

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,959
there's a psychologist miyahai sen mihai

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
who says the best moments in our lives

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
usually occur

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,360
if a person's body or mind is stretched

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,040
to its limits

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
in a voluntary effort to accomplish

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
something difficult and worthwhile

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
or if i'm going to kind of condense this

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
we like to do hard things that we're

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
good at there's something rewarding

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,239
about the experience of doing something

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,599
hard that not everyone can do

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,120
that we're able to do and the research

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,200
actually goes into

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
a visual diagram of this to explain what

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
the opposite things besides the

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,840
enjoyment of doing things we are good at

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,599
are this particular graphic is from

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
jessie shells the art of game design

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
people talk about this a lot with

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
building video games and board games

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
and it's the idea that you want the

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,479
level of skill you have

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
to match the amount of challenge you are

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
facing and that that magical feeling

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
comes when those two things are matched

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
and you are in a state of flow

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,960
so you want to think about the bottom of

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
the chart what being bored feels like

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
if you've ever had that experience where

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
you're going to have to do some manual

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,840
tasks

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
like copy paste a lot of email addresses

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,520
into a spreadsheet or

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
basically anything that's manual labor

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
like that and you go oh okay instead of

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
doing this like tedious labor for the

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,280
next two hours i'm just gonna write a

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,440
script

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,800
and then it takes way longer than it

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,639
would have done to just do whatever the

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
manual task was but you felt a lot

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,280
better about it because you weren't

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,880
bored while doing it

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,080
that's how much developers like to be in

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,919
flow we really want to avoid boredom

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
and then on the top side of the chart

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
everything about what anxiety feels like

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
when you're developing

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,160
if you've ever ended up with you have no

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,680
idea why it's working

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
you are ready to bang your head against

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,039
your desk you are so frustrated because

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,720
you can't figure it out and you have no

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
idea what the next step is

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
that's when it's too hard and you're

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,520
facing the anxiety and

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
you're not in flow

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
so this is what we want it to be like we

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,720
want it to be hard but we also want to

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
be able to be like el woods and legally

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
blonde and say what like it's hard

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,800
i just did it i worked through it sure

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,560
it took me a while but i got there

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
so what i want to do with the rest of

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
our time is talk about how we can

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
consider a developer experience

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,199
if we're really optimizing for flow

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,880
rather than easiness

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
so the first half of this i think a lot

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,440
of times when we think about developer

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
experience we think about getting

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
started

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,039
we think about onboarding and new users

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
and people who want to try our tool and

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
i think that's a great place to start

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,440
while we were building dark i got to

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
spend a ton of time pairing with other

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
people who wanted to build something

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
using the language

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,600
and over time i noticed that there are

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
three primary learning styles for

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,759
developers

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
this is different you might have heard

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,039
about learning style theory before

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,039
the idea that some people like to learn

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,720
verbally some people like to learn

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,240
kinesthetically through movement some

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,919
people like to learn by building things

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
this is a little bit different what i

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,440
found specifically for developers

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,960
was that there were three primary

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
archetypes of people how people would

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
approach learning something new

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,160
there was a set of people who just

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,039
wanted to read all the documentation and

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
load the entire system into their head

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,720
there was also a set of people who

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,600
wanted to go into the experience and

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
they had a stock

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
project they put onto every blank canvas

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,720
it might have been a fibonacci it might

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
have been a project oiler problem

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
it might have been a dummy app that they

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
were really confident making but they

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,280
wanted to make something from scratch

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
and then the third set of people wanted

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,440
to see a finished application

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
and be able to take it apart and go from

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
there in order to learn how to build

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
their own thing

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,280
now this is important because most of us

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
developed one of these three styles i'm

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,639
more of the third one

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,319
and if you approach a tool and it only

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,680
focuses on one of these and it's not

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
yours you're

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
in for a lot of pain you'll end up in a

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,680
situation where the level of challenge

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
is exceptionally high relative to what

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,520
you know

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
because you're not just trying to learn

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,479
something new you're trying to learn

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
something new

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
by learning in a new way and so for all

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,400
of us who are out there building tools

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and trying to make developer experience

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,880
better

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
we need to keep in mind that the way we

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,919
think about learning something new

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,080
isn't necessarily the way every

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
developer is and if we're only going to

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
have one type of onboarding we should

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
keep in mind

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,960
it's probably only going to work for a

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,599
subset of people who might otherwise

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,479
benefit

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,479
from using our tool

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,039
now that's only one type of too hard

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,360
what about if we want to remediate

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,800
that's something slightly too hard

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
the experience of something being

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
slightly too hard will probably show up

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
if you see

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,319
a lot of people getting excited talking

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
about the project on the hacker news

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,720
starring the pressure on github

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,759
but then not actually using it for

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
something or you see

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
a lot of excitement but it doesn't

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
translate into much usage

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,440
so there's a few things we can do to

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,720
make too hard better

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,759
the first one is to anchor on a familiar

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
onboarding

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
so people are accustomed to learning new

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,840
things by doing something from the cli

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,440
like that's great having a cli will make

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,879
them feel a lot more at home right away

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
because they're starting with something

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,199
they don't similarly

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
it can be connecting to an existing

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
skill so it's going to be a lot more

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
comfortable to pick up a new tool if

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
someone says oh here's the best way to

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
use this tool coming from javascript if

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
you have years of experience

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
with javascript or any other language

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,360
for that matter

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
but giving people an existing skill to

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
anchor to

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
is also really helpful and then the

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
third one

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,519
that i think is quite similar is the

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,399
idea that you can connect to an existing

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
workflow

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,919
perhaps it's adjacent to two other steps

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
in a tool chain

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
and it works in a similar way that's

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
something that's gonna help someone get

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,959
in their head oh

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,800
this is how i fit this in with

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,320
everything else i'm doing and that ends

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,480
up feeling a lot more comfortable

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
one caveat that i want to have here that

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
i think people often miss

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
is that sometimes having more expertise

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
going into a new tool

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,080
actually makes things harder so if you

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
have learned a very specific mental

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
model of the world

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
and you are shifting tools you might

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
have to unlearn something that you

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
already know

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,200
a really interesting example of this is

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,640
dark was functional

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
and so i spent a lot of time working

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,680
with a whole bunch of different

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,120
developers on some of the key concepts

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
and over time i found that if people

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
knew another functional language that

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,959
was the best they picked things up the

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
most quickly

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
if people hadn't actually spent that

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
much time programming so think like

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,720
data scientists or pms who were fairly

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
technical but didn't write code all day

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,279
as developers

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,560
they did fine they didn't really think

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
functional languages were weird because

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
they didn't have a point of comparison

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,920
the people who had a hardest time were

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,279
people who had really internalized

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
imperative models because they were

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,519
having to

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
undo a bunch of stuff they were assuming

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
about what dark would be like and then

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
figure it out

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
and that's not just true about

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,120
functional verse imperative languages

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,120
can be true about a whole bunch of

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,640
things um so

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
the more expertise someone has it might

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
actually make it harder for them to

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
learn a new tool even though you would

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,680
expect them to thrive

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,320
now the reason we were originally here

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,279
what about the opposite experience

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,120
remediating

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,680
when it is too easy and so it too easy

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
looks like

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
is people try something out and they go

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,720
okay

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
and then it doesn't really seem to

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,959
matter to them it may be cool but not

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
useful

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,720
the most painful example of this i

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
encountered was of course with dark

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
where what we had was you had the

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,760
ability to set up a data store that you

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
could use within your backend web

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
application

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,079
you was either one command or you

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,760
clicked on one button

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,839
you can get into keyboard mouse things

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
in the discord later if people want to

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,040
and it just made a data store and then

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
you could write out your schema and you

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,760
could use it

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,800
this did not work for people a large

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,519
chunk of the time people click the

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
button and go

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
that's not a data store and i would say

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,200
yes it is it says so right there

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
you can see the icon it says db on it

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
you can see where you put the schema in

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
you can put objects in you can take them

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,600
back

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,200
out and people just really didn't think

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,680
it was possible that they had

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,600
made a data store that quickly and it

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
was extreme cognitive dissonance and so

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
i would spend more time trying to

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,240
convince them it was a data store

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,920
than i would have spent if it had simply

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
been a little bit harder to make one to

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
begin with

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
so to show you what that experience

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
looks like i'm going to show you another

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
application

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
that i think did that really well but to

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,040
contextualize

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,040
you might remember kayak from kind of

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
the earlier 2000s

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,079
when you were searching to book a flight

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,079
in kayak

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,200
the little meter at the top the flippy

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
it was uh

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,399
like a trained carousel old mechanical

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
sign

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
would flip to claim it was searching

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
each airline individually

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,800
if you've ever worked on travel you know

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,880
this is like not how amadeus or saber or

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,360
any travel backend actually works

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,040
but it gave customers the feeling that

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,480
kayak was doing all of the work they had

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
been doing by manually checking each

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
airline

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
so you can do a similar thing with one

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,880
click databases

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
so there's this app railway app who's

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,240
done basically the same thing

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,040
you can see this here when you provision

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,040
your data store

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,760
they do this thing where it waits for a

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,279
while and then it sets up

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
and so what i like about this i'll let

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,600
it loop a few times so you can see it

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
is that it takes long enough that you

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
feel like it's a real data store

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
and then it lands you in the types of

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
things that mediate the experience being

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,240
too hard so it keeps it from being too

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
easy

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,680
and then keeps it from being too hard by

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
providing the next set of steps for what

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,720
you should do

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,680
connecting to your cli and looking at

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
where your project lives

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,519
so the remediations for when something

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,800
is too easy

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,720
you need to make it feel believably hard

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,160
you need to make it feel like whatever

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
you're working on you have actually

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,360
truly accomplished something

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
and you need to make it enough effort

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,160
that people feel like they've done

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,200
something meaningful not just like they

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
clicked a button

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,399
none of us want the experience of

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
developing software to just be like one

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
copy paste we want to feel like we're

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
making progress by doing it

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,279
and that's what helps us bring people

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,519
back up into flow when it's gotten too

00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
easy

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
so those are the three things i think

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,680
you should consider when people are

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
getting started

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
the learning style making sure that it's

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,480
not too hard

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,880
making sure it's not too easy the

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,560
goldilocks onboarding experience

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,160
but the key thing is you have to keep

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
going with this this isn't like a piece

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,959
of software that you use once when we're

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,680
thinking about the tooling that we're

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,040
using

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
we learn how to use it but then we keep

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
using it every day for years

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
and we get to many of us get to do this

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
at work all the time

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,360
and so we want our continued experiences

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,360
to keep having this feeling

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,160
so one concept we'll bring up here is

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
the idea of progressive disclosure it's

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,279
commonly used kind of as an information

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
architecture thing but it's the idea

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
that

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,880
you don't want to overwhelm people by

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
showing all the information at once

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,360
if you show all the information at the

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,959
beginning you're going to be up in that

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
anxiety state where it's too much to

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,600
comprehend

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
and you get overwhelmed on the and

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
plus if you do that first show

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
everything up front everyone's really

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
anxious

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,000
and then they learn it all and then

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,199
they're really bored because there's

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,959
nothing new

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,800
and so progressive disclosure is the

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,680
idea that you want to keep

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,360
meeting the information out over time

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,279
what i think is distinct for developers

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,560
compared to any other applications using

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,079
this concept

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,399
is that we have two great tools for

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,800
doing this error messages

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,639
and documentation so by having good

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
error messages when someone's getting

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
stuck

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
you might easily get into a state of

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,240
anxiety with an error message

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,720
having a good message means you can read

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
it you can understand what's going on

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
and you can start to figure out how

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
you're going to solve it so that

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
lowers the anxiety and gets you back

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,800
into flow once you've

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
figured out what's going on you can use

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,440
the documentation to figure out how to

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
solve your problem

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,639
and keep moving along with your new

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,639
skill

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
similarly you find yourself starting to

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
get a little bit bored and wanting

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
something new

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
maybe something gets pushed you

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,040
automatically through progressive

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
disclosure or maybe you

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
go to the docs and you see what else is

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,760
there and you explore

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
uh you reach out to the community and

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,760
you find out what else might be going on

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,279
and that'll also bring you back up into

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,800
flow because you're able to do more

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,440
complex work

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,199
and so error messages and documentation

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,959
are particularly important because

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,760
they're what helps us continue to grow

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,920
and use the tool

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,920
after that initial onboarding experience

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,240
once you're at that place where you're

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,639
consistently using

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
and growing in a tool there's also some

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
one more thing that i think is

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
particularly important when we're

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,800
thinking about experience

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
which is customization there's a reason

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
we all like to talk about

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,839
which terminal we're using and show our

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,440
editor theme

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
and like what our custom setup is or

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
even the peripherals of what camera and

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,000
microphone and monitor we use in our

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
workstation

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,279
it's because we really like optimizing

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,880
our craft

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
the joy of learning how to do something

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
and then learning how to do it perfectly

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
for us

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,160
is something that keeps you in flow it

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,680
keeps you continuing to get better and

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,959
you end up at a point where

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,240
you are a true expert over your domain

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,759
the other good thing about doing this

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,519
with tools is it allows you as an

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
individual to invest in the tool and get

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
something back

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
and so you have this virtuous cycle of

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,079
you're learning more but you're putting

00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,759
back

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,120
into the ecosystem or at least into your

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
own work

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,279
and so the ability to customize and

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
continue to be an expert

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,560
even after you've been using something

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
for a long time is really what keeps us

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,839
in this high end of flow

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,000
so i hope by now i've convinced you that

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
good developer experience

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
isn't about easy easy is the thing that

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
appeals to people when they're realizing

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,320
we want to save a lot of time and money

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,800
globally

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
but easy isn't that experience you have

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,160
that is indescribable

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
when you've lost track of time and you

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,279
are building something that matters to

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,600
you

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,040
a good developer experience really means

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
thinking about people's learning styles

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,079
when they're getting started

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,680
making it not too hard and not too easy

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,560
again think of a goldilocks if that

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,959
helps

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,480
giving people ways to learn over time

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,600
through progressive disclosure through

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
good documentation

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,199
through good error messaging so people

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,680
can solve their own issues

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
and think of customization as the expert

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,399
mode that keeps our developer

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,320
experiences interesting

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,959
even after we've been doing this for

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,959
years and years

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,440
when you're thinking about building a

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,799
developer experience we don't want magic

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
we want to get to be magicians

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
i hope you'll join me in the discord

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,679
after this to talk more about some of

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,039
these concepts

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,319
if you have a different learning style

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
that i didn't talk about i would love to

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,480
hear about that

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,760
if you want to totally disagree with me

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,600
and say you wish your job was easy and

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,839
you think no code is the next big thing

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,959
i would love to talk about that too uh

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,880
for any reason you're watching this

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,160
after you can't join in discord i'm at

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,600
ellen shusa on twitter

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
and i'm happy to talk more about this

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,520
anytime

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
