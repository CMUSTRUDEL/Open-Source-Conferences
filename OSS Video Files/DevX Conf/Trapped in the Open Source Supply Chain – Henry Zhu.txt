Title: Trapped in the Open Source Supply Chain â€“ Henry Zhu
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Let us talk about the perspective of open source projects as dependencies. As someone in the middle of it, I just wanted to share some thoughts on taking what is considered largely a hobby and going the donation route. What are maintainers free to work on, what is the lifecycle of a project, what is worth funding anyway?

hi everyone

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,160
my name is henry i'm a maintainer on the

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,119
babble project

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
i'm here to just share some thoughts and

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,599
experiences about what it's like to be

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,320
a maintainer you could think of this

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
talk as

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,040
xkcd2347 expanded upon

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,040
as a talk and going into how

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,079
open source can be seen as kind of like

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
a microcosm

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,360
of our greater digital culture so i

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
don't have like a grand theory of open

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,280
source i'm just sharing

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
some experiences and kind of what does

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
it

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
feel like on the inside to be that

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,199
random person that has been maintaining

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,520
something for a long time

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,480
think of it as a phenomenology of open

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
source

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,280
you know one way to look at open source

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,360
can be as a supply chain

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
from the company's point of view you can

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,360
see these dependencies as risks

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,920
anything you rely on becomes a liability

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
and every company is using open source

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,720
so

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,640
why do we assume that these projects

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
will continue to last

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,960
there's a sense where you're already

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
relying on all these projects

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
and trusting the people behind them to

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
maintain them

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
and you think about it the reason why

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
open source works at all is because you

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,400
don't have to know

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,520
who these people are so this question is

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
interesting because

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,200
we kind of outsource and we defer our

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
responsibility to these other people

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
sometimes they're unknown coding allows

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
us to

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
kind of abstract away not having to

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,479
think about

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
implementations and open source in some

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,640
sense

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
does the same thing except it hides our

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,719
dependencies and it also

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
hides the people behind them and so i

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
guess

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,719
maybe i just like to argue that those

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,520
people

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,159
matter and so you can think of open

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
source as

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
infrastructure i like the metaphor that

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,200
nadia makes

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,080
in her paper rows and bridges

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
right there's a lot of labor that is

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
being

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,319
done for this digital infrastructure

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
that we have

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
i think that heartbleed was kind of a

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
wake up call for a lot of people

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,640
2014 it was interesting seeing that

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
the the project for us open ssl only had

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,879
the annual budget of two thousand

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
dollars

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,879
and a lot of companies had to band

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,519
together to help fund that

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,400
effort for a few years even in

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
javascript

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,480
we've had many incidents of i guess

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
seeing where the supply chain runs and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
my

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,319
my own twitter handle is just based off

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
of this lift pad

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,599
thing that happened and there's a lot

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
you could say about

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,680
left pad how it's only 11 lines that

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
maybe we didn't need

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,440
to have that many dependencies but

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
that's kind of

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
what has been happening in our culture

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
of not really understanding how they

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
work or not understand who's

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,040
behind them event stream was a similar

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,480
thing that happened 2016

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,280
except in this case it was dominic who

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
has a lot of packages decided to give

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
the

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,480
publishing rights to someone that was

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,599
contributing but that person ended up

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
trying to upload malicious code

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,239
and so the dif the thing is it's easy to

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,599
blame someone for saying like well why

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,440
didn't you check

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
who that person was but like he was

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
saying that it's it's normal for people

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
to

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,959
share access rights and to allow people

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
to contribute back

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,680
and it's kind of hard to vet who is

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
worthy of being trusted if someone works

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
on a project

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,519
and like in his case for a few weeks and

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
they seemed quote-unquote normal

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
then it would be hard to say that he

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,280
made the wrong decision because that

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
sort of thing happens all the time

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,519
and so this this trust that's happening

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,360
it's happening at every level

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,560
and yeah it's hard to know like what

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
exactly the best

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,120
scenario is in terms of how many

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
barriers we want to create

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,799
to allow people to contribute back

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,880
yeah it's a hard balance and this is

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,600
just for like small projects right

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
i think that open source is such a big

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,160
word it's

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
kind of hard to know what exactly we

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,240
mean and github doesn't necessarily help

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
with that because everything looks the

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
same

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
you know in this example i just found

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
like a random project i had from a long

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
time ago

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
for a hackathon i'm never going to work

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
on this project again

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,479
i don't expect anyone or even want

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
anyone to contribute

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,240
it's kind of there as a time capsule or

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
you know you you

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
make something for your resume or

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,320
something or just an old project

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,680
that you want to just put up there just

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,199
so people can see but you're not

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,919
expecting collaboration so that's

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
different

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,199
well the source is open but nobody is

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
planning on

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
working on it you know repo could be

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
like a garden

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
or it could be you know archived it's

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
it's not actually being used or

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
dependent on

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
at all so there's no expectation of

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
funding or

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
any of that stuff and no one's feeling

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
entitled to anything and babel

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
and like other projects that could be

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
more like a whole town where like

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
there's not a lot of people working a

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
lot of people using it

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
and then you can get up to a level of

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,440
like node or

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
tensorflow and also a lot of people

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
working on it too they're maybe

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,000
full-time paid

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
all of these different kinds of projects

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
have different

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
feelings of obligations right if it's

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,759
smaller maybe you feel like it's not

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,440
that bad if you're not working on it but

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
if you're someone like syndra

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
who has hundreds of npm packages that he

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
maintains

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,120
then then you might still feel obligated

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,199
to work on all of them

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,520
a little bit but it'll be a lot harder

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
to ask for like funding because

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,680
that each individual project doesn't

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,520
seem as necessary

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
as like a big one and so yeah this this

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,039
feeling of obligation is mostly

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
self-imposed

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,360
but i think that it's fostered through

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
our environment and the workflows that

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
we create

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
trying to check all your github

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
notifications just like your email

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
and your twitter and your slack your

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,520
discord stack overflow

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,360
just seeing how many issues are in the

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
queue or how many pull requests

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,720
this is not even something that's unique

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,440
to open source we all

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,520
partake in this ritual of you know

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,240
internalizing these habits

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,080
you know we have to answer our ringtone

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,840
we swipe up to refresh there's the

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,039
infinite doom scrolling

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,520
the buzzing of your you know watch and

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
it feels like you just you have to

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,280
answer these things

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
and you know we learn sometimes to you

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,240
know create filters

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,199
lock the phone or do not disturb stuff

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,520
like that but

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
ultimately i think we still feel that

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
sense of like guilt

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,639
and you know i think that's not that

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
different from other

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
habits that are created in the

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
environments that are there

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,080
so one example would be in the mall

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,479
that's a great example of ritual as well

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,319
you know back when we used to go to them

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
it was a place that was enclosed with no

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,720
windows so that you lose your sense of

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,960
time

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,680
there's no instructions on necessarily

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,400
what to do but you're kind of guided by

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,599
all the different shops and even the

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,479
mannequins that tell you

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
how to dress or what to buy or how your

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,560
life would be better if you do it this

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
way

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
and so we're yeah we're constantly

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
shaped by the environment around us

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
even if you know you could say that it's

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,759
easy to just stop

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,840
or it's easy to just quit doing open

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
source you can run away

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,880
but i guess i'm just saying that like

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,319
that feeling

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,479
is still there and it makes it really

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,960
hard to make what is

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,759
considered a simple decision it's not

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,560
easy

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
nadia ekbar had this book called working

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,080
in public

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,199
written last year and she has a great

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
two by two

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
breakdown of how some projects work and

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
the

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
low contributor growth high user growth

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
section

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
she calls a stadium and it's funny

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
because the example there is bowel which

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,680
is the project that i work on

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,120
and usually i guess this is the type of

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,479
project that i'm speaking of when i

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,639
think about

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,240
the issues that i'm feeling at least

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,080
where there's not a lot of people

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
working on the project but there's

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,840
higher and higher amounts of people

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,919
using it and so as those users scale up

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,759
it's almost inevitable that you'll it

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,120
will lead to burnout because

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,560
even though the code is zero marginal

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
cost you can download it and that

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
doesn't affect anything

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,080
the the cost comes at the attention of

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
the people working on

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
the maintainer's attention where you

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,719
know that's obviously limited

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
and the scale of the requests that come

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
in not

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
necessarily downloads but people

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
reporting issues people requesting

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
features

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,000
chatting on various social media

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
those things can't scale if the number

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
of people don't grow either

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,920
and it's not that different from any

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
other kind of content creation

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,560
where you give something away for free

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,120
and you feel obligated to continue

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,680
uploading youtube videos or whatever to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,399
maintain a certain

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
i think it maybe it also leads to

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,600
pointing out that

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,680
you know these projects might not stay

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
in the different sections that they're

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,480
from maybe a lot of projects start off

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
as a toy

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,000
where you're just doing it for fun

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,680
you're not expecting anyone to use it

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
and maybe they feel like they need it to

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,800
turn into a stadium or a federation

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,800
just because other people are doing it

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,959
people should feel free to

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,959
work on open source the way they want

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,000
but then when they get to

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,000
a stadium like when i joined babel

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
it was already popular i wasn't trying

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
even to make it hyped up or

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
anything i was just like oh i want to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
help out and then

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,480
that opportunity might have eventually

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,880
turned

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
into a sense of obligation because maybe

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,959
you feel like you're the only one that

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
can work on it

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,080
even though that's not true yeah so

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,440
there's a lot of idealism

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,079
in open source on what open short

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
should be and how it's actually like

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
there's this assumption

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,000
that everything is just getting

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,600
to collaborate with anyone in the world

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
when in reality maybe you feel pretty

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
alone

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
even if you are working on a team um

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,920
there's this assumption that you have to

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,240
respond and help

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
everyone that shows up that you're

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
always on call there's no room to take a

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,120
break and

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
so you just feel like this loss of

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
control and i'm not like

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
saying that this is new or anything it's

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
not a new revelation

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,680
i've gone on and off on

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
dealing with burnout and this loss of

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,360
my boundaries and maybe you feel even

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
worse because you know that

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
you're still choosing to do open source

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
like no one's forcing you to do it maybe

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
it might not be

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
necessarily your job you could do

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,519
something else

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,279
and yeah that guilt interesting enough

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
hasn't really gone away even

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,600
in the different situations i felt it

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,399
when i was doing it for fun

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
outside of work i felt it when i was

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,920
doing

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,839
work on open source half time and now i

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
still feel it when i'm

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,640
getting paid to do it through donations

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
even people that are working on it full

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,079
time i think you know like

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
say facebook or microsoft i'm sure they

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,440
still feel

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,519
some sense of obligations to work

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
overtime or on the weekend or to answer

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
someone's question

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,160
and yet they're still getting paid for

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,519
it i guess it doesn't

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
necessarily make that go away this need

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
to

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
do more and more work leads to even more

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,160
and more work

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,040
that nolan wasn't even going into the

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,120
parts about

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,399
getting funded but just that he was

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
doing this in his free time

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
and i don't need to bring up too many

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,200
examples of all the

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,839
times that users have been entitled to

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
ask maintainers to fix their bugs and

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
stuff like that

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
but again something i have been thinking

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
about a lot is this

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
idea that you know we have a lot of good

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
intentions coming in

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
as a maintainer and then that leads to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
maybe a sense of

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,560
you know your own entitlement of feeling

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,959
jaded

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
and expecting something in return and

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,320
yeah i think everyone should be treated

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,720
fairly and and nicely but just you know

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,800
this quote from the dark knight that

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,959
you're trying so hard to help people and

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,639
maybe in the end you find yourself that

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
you become the evil one

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
you know the phrase the road to hell is

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
paid with good intentions

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,760
that seems to come up a lot or at least

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,200
i feel that way

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
you know there's sort of this backlash

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
that you get in the open source world if

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,320
you don't keep everything open

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
and it's interesting finding like a

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,320
project like sql lite where

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,000
the code is open source and yet they

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
don't actually ask for contributions at

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,079
all

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
because they want to make sure that

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
everything is in public domain and it's

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,720
perfectly in their right

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,079
to not be so open in terms of the

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
collaboration aspect

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
but maybe this is okay because they've

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
always done it that way

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,639
if you know we decided to do this then

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,920
it might

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,360
seem different or bad one example i

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,279
reminded of is

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
how view three at least in the

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,079
javascript world they basically made

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,120
that closed source in a way they worked

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
on it

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,880
by themselves worked on iterated it and

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
then they presented to the public or

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
sort of

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
similar with react hooks well you have

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,720
this backlash where people expect

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
everything to be open

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
including what you're thinking even

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,200
though you're not even sure what to do

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
next

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,880
and this funding issue isn't even

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,079
specific to a small project but even

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,279
mozilla right

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,279
with mdn this essay is pointing out

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,480
that it's like similar to applauding

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
healthcare workers

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
instead of actually funding them that

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
this work that is so important could be

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,399
done by volunteers when

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,480
in reality it should be paid for it's

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
not like anyone here had bad intentions

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
but

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
maybe it doesn't get to the root of the

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,639
issue that this

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,440
important work if it is deemed to be

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
important

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
it should be compensated in the end

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,079
maybe all we have is

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,440
guilt as maintainers fat had this talk

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
in 2013 where he creates this metaphor

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
of this

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,040
cute puppy syndrome where open source is

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,399
deemed to be something that we have to

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,720
take care of that's alive

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
that maybe it grows old and we are

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,560
afraid of it

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,000
dying and so and then we keep taking

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,480
care of more and more puppies

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
and then we're not we're afraid to give

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,519
it to other people

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,639
because we feel responsible yeah i think

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,120
a lot of open source

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
is prone to this quantification of how

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
many stars you have how many issues you

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,279
have how many downloads you have

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
you know we have somehow 100 million

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,760
downloads a month

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,560
and with this many dependencies and so

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
you

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,680
it's easy to focus so much on all these

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,040
things chasing

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,920
numbers and how many sponsors and users

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,000
that we have

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,320
that it can lead to la burna

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,040
and so i think of this good hearts law

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
where

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,560
when we target a certain measure it

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,720
ceases to be good

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,800
whether it's search engine optimization

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
or how many papers are cited or your

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,480
code coverage or

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,639
your stars there's over emphasis

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,760
sometimes on that measurement

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,760
i think that this is epitomized

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,120
in this this picture right the thing

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,240
that we think of

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,720
is the contribution graph but it a lot

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
of times

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,680
it's funny as a joke but also it maybe

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,040
it leads to a sense of dread

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
where you know you can see it on the

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
bathroom and the restaurant and that's

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
really cool

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
but you know what happens when you look

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,560
at someone else's contribution graph

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
and it's really easy to judge someone by

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
seeing oh they had a lot of

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
contributions that must mean they've

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,079
been doing a lot of work

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
we don't know it's hard to say is it

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,959
because they lost their job or

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
maybe they got a job or maybe they were

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
just busy

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,240
with other things monica has a great

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,120
picture here that does annotate

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,079
how she interprets our help contribution

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
graph

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,279
it's a cool artifact of just seeing how

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,720
your year went

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,120
in review but jen instead

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,079
she got to annotate how her github graph

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
looked and

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,959
seeing that just depending on different

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,680
problems at work or you had a new job

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,199
or you got pregnant or you were sick

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,600
there's different reasons why

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,880
the github contribution graph isn't all

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,839
green basically

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,120
and so i'm also reminded of a quote from

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,839
yvonne illich

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
and bringing up this measurement in

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,000
terms of

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,519
what grade level you're at that somehow

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
dropping out might be worse than not

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
going to school at all because

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
it just makes you feel bad that you

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,279
didn't make it

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,720
and maybe that's the same thing when you

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,040
know people

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,320
are trying to apply for a job and the

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
first thing we do is look at their

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,959
github and it's empty

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,639
then people will assume that you're not

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,320
contributing to open source and that's

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,639
like bad or something

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,800
i think it's good that we can use things

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,360
like all contributors to

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,320
add in contributions that aren't just

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,399
code

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
and to acknowledge you know whether it's

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
docs or

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
giving talks or making a video those are

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,959
all things that

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,880
are valued and can be valuable for open

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,120
source project

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,240
or we just decide to rebel against that

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,480
entirely

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
we can make programs that automatically

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,039
commit for us

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
because we know that it's absurd to

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,240
judge someone based on their commit

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,919
history and this is a funny way of

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,760
looking at it but yeah i think it gets

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,080
at some issues that

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
is just more subtle in terms of the

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
graph nothing's wrong with

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,520
having a streak or trying to maintain

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,480
writing code all the time but sometimes

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
it makes us

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
look differently at other programmers

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,600
yeah so if there's something wrong

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,120
in the technical system then we default

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,160
now to the idea that we are the problem

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,039
not the machine not the algorithm not

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,039
the program but rather ourselves in

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,000
seeing how amazon is

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,919
planning to create algorithms to make it

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
so that people can be more optimized

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,919
is literally treating people like like

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,240
robots

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
that we will become like machines and i

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
like automation just as much as any

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,559
other programmer you know

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
writing and using bots to make it so i

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,160
don't have to

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,360
do the same tasks over and over but you

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
know it seems like

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,559
these pursuits can some can lead to

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
counter

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,880
productive results right the means

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,440
become ends

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
and another thing that i've been feeling

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
trapped in

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,120
is this commodification of everything

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,799
you know not just you know an open

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
source but you know

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,720
the content is king right now right

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
making

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,280
you know there's youtube videos or nfts

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,160
or commodifying ourselves

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,160
it feels weird to even think of open

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
source sometimes as a liability because

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,520
it's sort of like the idea

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,799
of hr calling people resources and i

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,400
find that

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,360
maybe this whole patreon model

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,000
is similar to the gig economy where you

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,679
know

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,520
our time has become money and i have to

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,400
spend some amount of effort so that some

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,240
person will give me a few dollars for

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
doing x x tasks it's hard to focus on

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,600
writing code

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,520
you know or doing a lot of these things

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,720
in open source because

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,919
you're not even sure if you're going to

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,080
have enough money to sustain yourself

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,440
in the next few months and then that

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
kind of builds up on itself because

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,280
you're worrying

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,320
that you can lose money if anything you

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,000
realize that

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,919
the more code that you write the less

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,760
money you make because

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
writing code doesn't lead to more

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
donations necessarily

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
if anything it might lead to less

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
because people are

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,799
think that you're okay with making so

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
little in the first place

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,039
if you think about not a lot of software

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
engineers would consider even joining a

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,280
startup or company that makes less money

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,840
than just one person at google

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,720
in the first place and even when it

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
feels like

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
things can be entertaining or fun to

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
create content

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
it's really demanding on your time your

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,039
your time in your life becomes

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,679
monetized it's never more true that

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,360
time is money right and you see that

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,919
people are trying to

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
all stream on twitch and they all have

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,559
no

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
viewers and it's like what are we doing

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,240
this for nothing's wrong with

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
trying to attempt it in the first place

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,799
but you've seen plenty of videos

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
talking about youtube burnout or twitter

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,039
burnout it feels like

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,000
everything has to become a business or

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,919
selling a course

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,840
creating a consultancy making a

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
certificate for your project

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
or raising your vc money to create a

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
service

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
these are all things other than working

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
on the code directly because

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,000
writing the code directly doesn't

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,640
actually get money

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
there's a pressure lor i guess to

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
escalate

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,520
that it feels like the end goal of every

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
open search project has to become a sas

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,320
company

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
not that that's wrong but maybe that

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,440
doesn't fit every single project

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,280
i don't really see how babel it would

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
make sense to become a service you know

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
i think

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,000
people are doing a great job whether

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
it's like

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,480
apollo or denno or versailles or gaspi

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,120
but i don't think you know every project

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,159
should be doing that or feels like they

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,240
need to do that

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,919
yeah it just feels like the solution of

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
every problem is to become a giant

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
company

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,159
that tells everyone to install their app

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,880
and

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,280
build in their ecosystem but it feels

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,960
like the human is being left behind

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
and i do want to get back to this

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,280
feeling that craig

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
mentions that you know i can write code

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
and

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,559
i can feel like i'm in control and it's

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,600
fun and there's a sense of joy

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,080
but i find like how celery says

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
like a lot of coding isn't coding at all

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200
and i guess i

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
admit now that even though she's

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,360
mentioning that

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,559
for early career developers they feel

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,240
like they're not being productive when

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,400
they're not writing code i feel that

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,919
right now even though i've been working

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,480
on this for many years now

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,000
still feel that way illitch talks about

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,200
this idea that

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,720
you know the tools that we make are

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,480
tend to be made to work for us uh rather

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
than to work with us

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,159
he speaks of this word conviviality

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
which i really like

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
talks about this idea that instead of

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
relying on

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
services and products how do we create

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,840
tools

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,360
so that we can be autonomous and to help

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,760
one another out

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,799
such that we can be interdependent that

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,720
we help

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,159
our communities rather than outsource

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,600
everything to

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,320
some product some commodity and he also

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
has this

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
concept of shadow work which speaks of

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
the kind of work that

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
is inherent to work it's a shadow of

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,039
what's

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,919
needed yet it's not considered work i

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,720
think from an

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,400
economist's point of view those are just

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,919
externalities they aren't priced in

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,520
but there's a lot of work that maybe

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
has its own i guess he would call

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,039
dignity that maybe we don't need to

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,440
or we shouldn't price because

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,960
you know whether it's the commute time

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
are we going to start tracking that

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,440
even if you think about child care or

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
parenting it's a similar thing where

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
it's like it's necessary

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,360
and needed and maybe we should pay for

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,039
those things but at the same time

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
maybe there's something about it that

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,760
needs to be thought differently

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,640
and so i go back to this picture again i

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,440
don't know it's weird

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,200
i feel trapped in a jail of my own

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,039
making right i'm free to

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,919
leave open source whenever but yet this

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,600
feeling of obligation and quantification

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,080
commodification

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,240
leads to just be not sure what to do

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,840
you lose your agency and i guess the

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,080
only thing you can do is

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,919
you feel like you can leave i'm not sure

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,320
what the solution is really it feels

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,200
like the onus falls on the maintainer

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,400
all the time to support yourself to

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
raise enough money

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,279
to write the code in the first place to

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
fix your issues to make a new feature to

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,200
make a road map

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
it kind of seems inevitable that it's

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
going to feel overwhelming

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,760
that you're going to feel bad not

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,919
writing code doing

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039
the fundraising and then you're not

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,559
really going to enjoy fundraising

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
because that's not what you're used to

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,640
and that's not what you wanted to do in

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,120
the first place

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,720
what dhh tries to say in this talk about

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,520
open source beyond the market

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,559
is appealing it's like illegiti's desire

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
to find not

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,679
alternative economics but an alternative

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,760
to economics itself

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,080
the idea that open source thinking can

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,559
help us to move away from this quid pro

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
quo

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,080
transactional way of thinking of doing

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,679
things for

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,120
its own sake that has its own dignity

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,520
and enjoyment the realization of matthew

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,120
8 freely you have received freely give

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,279
but it feels like it's only possible

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,000
because you work at a company that

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,919
sponsors

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,840
open source work full-time or you have a

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
full-time job that supports your free

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
time

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
it's still important to lower the

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,000
barriers so that not just the people

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,520
that are doing open source now can

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,360
continue to do it but that more people

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,679
can do it that didn't feel like they

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,120
could

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,440
have the privilege to do it in the first

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,559
place it feels like our machines are

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,279
becoming more and more

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,200
like people with gp d3 and all that but

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
then at the same time

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
it feels like we are becoming more and

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,039
more like machines

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,080
we treat our tools like resources we

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,200
treat the environment

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,520
as a resource and eventually we treat

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,320
people like sophisticated machines

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,840
and ultimately then you see yourself as

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,440
part of the system

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
you see yourself as the cog in the

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,080
machine in this case

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,279
the supply chain is that the right

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,159
metaphor for us to

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
conceive of ourselves and i just know

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,440
that

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
going ahead to do work isn't going to

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,760
solve the problem

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,320
simply continuing on our way to build or

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,640
to code

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,559
is maybe what led us to this situation

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
in the first place

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:18,559
so maybe the only thing that i need to

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,559
