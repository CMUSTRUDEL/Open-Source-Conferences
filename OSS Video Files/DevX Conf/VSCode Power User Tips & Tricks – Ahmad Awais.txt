Title: VSCode Power User Tips & Tricks – Ahmad Awais
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	After 10 years with Sublime Text, I switched to VSCode — the new open-source cross-platform editor everyone's talking about. I've spent over 1,000 hours perfecting my setup to help you switch today. In this talk, you'll get to learn tens of VSCode Power User workflows that'll help you save time and code more efficiently. Text manipulation to multi-cursors and even Markdown tips/tricks. You name it.

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,119
we are talking about vs code power user

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,359
workflows

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,199
i'm excited about this talk because i'm

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
going to cover a lot of ground here in

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
the next one hour so

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
i hope so you're excited as much as i am

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
for those of you who don't know me

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
i am ahmad avez i am a full-time open

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,760
sourcer

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
i love the open source software

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
community and i'm a javascript developer

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,239
advocate as well

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
i've spent over 10 years with wordpress

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
community

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
i have contributed to all sorts of

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
things like default wordpress theme

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,559
customized component

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
the gutenberg editor i've built wp gulp

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,399
and create couldn't block maybe you

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,360
already use one or two of my open source

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
software

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,600
i'm a google developers expert and i've

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
recently been serving on the community

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
committee of the node.js foundation

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,159
to make node.js more accessible for the

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,799
next billion users

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,720
and it is beyond me that about one and a

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
half million developers use my open

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,920
source code and about half a million

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
websites run that

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
so it's it's just amazing it is the

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
power of open source software

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
and at the core of my heart i'm an

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,360
engineer but you know what

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,040
crash that i'm an emoji i love emojis

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
and the best place to find me or to

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,159
connect with me is my twitter account

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
mr motherwest uh should go ahead and

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,200
follow me there

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
because i use my twitter account as a

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799
mini blog i tweet daily

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
and i tweet all sorts of things

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
developer jokes and whatnot if you see

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,720
the fire emoji in my tweets probably

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
that is going to be a hard development

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
tip

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,759
and you can also find me on github my

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,759
website mls.com or subscribe to my

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
newsletter called developers takeaway

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,960
and if you follow me on twitter it would

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,680
be super califragilistic

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
xp alodecious i said it right for once

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,119
okay let's move on

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
i launched this course called vs code

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
power user

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
in this course you'll find about like 70

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
videos and i have documented

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,319
all of my personal escort power user

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
workflow inside of it i've talked about

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
javascript go

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,680
php css and all of those good goodies

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
and tasty sheets

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
what happened was in 2017 i was working

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
with these giant big

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,040
software firms from google to facebook

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,120
to you know amazon

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,520
and software developers that i have a

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,920
huge respect for using vs code

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
so i thought there must be something

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,239
really good about this editor

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
since it is a microsoft product and

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239
engineers at other companies are using

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,040
it

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
that was odd back then now microsoft is

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,360
this huge open source company

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,760
but back then it was not like that so i

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
switched to vs code to see how it is

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,519
turns out it is a javascript based code

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,120
editor so

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
i was able to contribute to the course

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,000
software of my editor which was amazing

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
by the way

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
since we are web developers we tend to

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
have this

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,640
you know friend among us to change

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
things and don't like them

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
how they are and that serves you well

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,959
when you are using an open source code

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
editor which is actually built with the

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,120
languages with the web technologies

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,640
that you have some command on so that

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
was one of the most exciting things

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,080
about vs code

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
but more than that microsoft has been

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
adamant

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,319
on improving vs code every single month

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,720
their

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
entire workflow and the timeline for

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,319
their open source

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
releases and everything is entire open

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
source you can just go ahead and see and

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
contribute to this awesome piece of

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
editor

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
about 6000 developers have already

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
switched to vs code by learning

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,599
my personal workflow through this course

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,680
and if you are interested you can go

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
ahead and sign up for the master class

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
at the link at the bottom there last

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
year when i was on word sesh talking

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
about different kind of developer

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
tooling workflows

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
i had just announced a theme for vs code

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
called shades of purple

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
lesson i know that it would become a

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,120
vital theme where

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,840
about 1.3 million developers would be

00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
using it

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,360
and all of these awesome developers

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
actually have helped me build

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
an entire suit of shades of purple

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
themes you can now

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
get a shader purple theme for vs code

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
item 2 hyper slack

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,959
alternate console segment you know you

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
name it and there is a theme for

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,079
shades of purple for that particular

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,840
software i was

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,239
just reading a tweet that a guy has

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,479
actually ported my theme to film as well

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,600
or you could use it on your website like

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,400
scotchio does

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
it uses prism css to include shades of

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
purple

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
inside all of their so it's an amazing

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
theme

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,360
and it is built around this amazing idea

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,759
that different programming languages

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
should have consistent colors for

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
example if there is a variable in php in

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,639
go language

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,320
in javascript or wherever it should have

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
a similar consistent coloring

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
if you start using this particular theme

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
it is not only accessible

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,880
easy on your eyes but like in a month or

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,520
so you will start picking up on things

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,040
inside of your own code just because of

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
the consistent colors

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
and all of a sudden if you write

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
something wrong that would turn red

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,000
and it would alert you that some funny

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,320
business is going on there

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
so go ahead and try out the shades of

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
purple theme

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
i built it because i love the perfect

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
color i think

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,639
purple can be genius okay enough with

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,720
the introduction

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,120
let's move on to the exciting part of

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
the stock vs code power user workflows

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,919
ahead

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080
so what i've done here is i have picked

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,520
out seven different videos from my vs

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,320
code dot pro vs

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,600
power user course and i've included them

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
inside of this talk

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
and we are going to review all of that

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,199
i'm going to teach you

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
some vs code basics some user interface

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
know how we're going to play with the

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,600
command palette

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,199
and i'm going to talk about key maps as

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
well that can help you switch today and

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
you know bring your

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
own shortcuts or snippets from your own

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
editor

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,080
right inside of the vs code editor after

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
that really fun videos about

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
file handling and file editing yoga

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,440
where i'm going to talk about

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,360
all of those multicultural things that

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
you see all of these advanced developers

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,479
use

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,080
and how you can manipulate with the text

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,240
in a very good way they're like

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
14 different methods in there many of

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,720
you already know that i love markdown

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,319
i use markdown in my blogs to build my

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
websites and whatnot

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,520
even the slides that you are looking at

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
right now this is

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
this right here is a exploding head

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,919
emoji and all of this

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
is marked down yes i write my talks in

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,880
markdown as well

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,199
and i'm going to teach you about how i

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,440
do that how customize of a market and

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,080
workflow i have inside of escort

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,240
so how about we get started let's jump

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
in

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
visual studio code as you might already

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
know does not share

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
any of its lineage with visual studio

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
it's a completely new editor

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
it's completely redefined it's free it's

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
open source

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,479
and it runs everywhere since it's open

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
source being an open source developer

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,240
i was able to contribute to the core

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
software of this open source editor

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
which is fantastic

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
while i'm gonna be teaching you this

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,160
course on a mac you can easily click

00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
here

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
and download the stable version for

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,680
windows or linux

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,680
there's also an insider version for

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,479
example if you click here

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
basically the vs code insider's version

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,479
gets the latest release

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
each day it is only meant for early

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
adopters to test the functionality

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,759
and i would not recommend you to use

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
this for writing code

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
visual studio code which is also called

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,639
vs code or simply code

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,560
actually came out of this monaco editor

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
the monaco editor is the code editor

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
that powers vs code

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,759
you can actually install it with npm

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,000
anywhere you want

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
for example here's the monaco editor

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,319
using my shades of purple theme

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
right inside of my chrome browser it

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
also contains the diff editor

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,080
as you can see here which is pretty

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,120
impressive so go ahead and download

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
visual studio code

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
first time you open visual studio code

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,680
you will meet the welcome screen

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,440
before going into the details here let's

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,720
explore the user interface

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,199
first as compared to many ides out there

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
visual studio code comes with a very

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,000
minimal

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
interface and it is one of those things

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,560
that i really really like about it

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
let's explore what this interface is

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
made up of

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
on the left side here you will find an

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,319
activity bar

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,039
with a bunch of icons in it this

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
activity bar helps you switch between

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,879
different views and gives you context

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,520
specific

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,160
indicators inside here you will find the

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
explorer

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,360
where you can explore all the files of

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
your project you can

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,479
find search replace anything throughout

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,959
your project

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,159
for example stack and there you can see

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,440
the packages in

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
and stack.js files have the word stack

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
in them

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
then there is the source control view

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
where you can see the changes

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,160
after that there is the debugger you can

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
set up the configurations here

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,080
and finally you can check out the

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,200
extensions marketplace here

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,920
with over 000 extensions for vs code

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,080
right now

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
so this thing right here is what we call

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
the sidebar

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:06,000
you can press command or control plus b

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,080
to toggle the sidebar this area right

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,920
here is what we call the editor group

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
it is actually the editor where you

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,320
write your code you can also press

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,360
ctrl tilde to view a panel

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,800
which has the terminal the debug console

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,720
output and it also has this problems

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,800
panel where you can see if there are any

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
problems inside your code a linter could

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
report these problems or whatnot

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
you can also find the information about

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
your open project

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,920
in the files you're editing in this area

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,800
right below here which is called the

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
status bar

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,760
for example right now i am editing a

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,839
javascript file finally on the far left

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
is the activity bar on the bottom is the

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
status bar

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,560
this is the editor group and below the

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
editor group

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,720
you can find different panels you can

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
also move this panel

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
to the vertical area here or

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
at the bottom whichever is your cup of

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,240
tea well the default theme that comes

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
with visual studio code is good enough

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,160
but if you are a power user like me

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
you'd want to change it you want to hack

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
it around

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,480
have some sort of a custom built

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
workflow around it you are in luck today

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
because i have just released this new

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,360
theme called shades of purple let's go

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,120
ahead and install it and then i'll

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
explain to you why i really like it so

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
i'm going to press command shift x

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
to go to my extensions remove everything

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,680
there search for

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,640
shades of purple there you have it and

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
then let's click

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
install well i happen to be a big fan of

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,920
purple color

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
i think so purple can be genius and

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,160
looks like it's already installed

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
and let's click reload well what should

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,120
have happened here

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
is that visual studio code should have

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
applied the theme that i just recently

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
installed but

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,440
it looks like that we have to actually

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,600
go to this gear icon

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
click on color theme select the shades

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,959
of purple as our default

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
and voila our theme is there so i have

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,320
done a lot of things with this visual

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,880
studio code theme called shades of

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
purple

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
and for example one thing that i can

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
show you right off the bat is the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,279
markdown syntax

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
while it is really easy to learn

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,959
markdown syntax

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
you can do it like in a week but i don't

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
want this syntax to be

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
very prominent to me because i do a lot

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
of my writings in my visual studio code

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,399
and i

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,880
want the syntax to be as hidden as it

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
could be

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,640
for example if you see that i'm trying

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,040
to bold this word the syntax around it

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,880
is kind of a hidden syntax it is more

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,880
prominent when you're writing code and

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,680
you have these backticks with the name

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
of a language

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
around it and they don't really look

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,519
very well in other themes but what i

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
have done is i have chosen a dull color

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
for these punctuations for markdown and

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
it looks really well

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,440
only the things that really matter stand

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
out for example let's go to the old

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
theme we had

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,480
i think it was the dark video studio and

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,640
take a look at this now this

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,720
looks messy there's a lot of syntax

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
which shouldn't be meddling around with

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,120
our code but as soon as we move

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,360
away from this theme to shades of purple

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,000
you can see that syntax that does not

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,240
matter to

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,200
our writing kind of goes away while it's

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,200
really minimal

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,399
i think most of the developers have

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
looked at it as

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
a welcoming change and there are a lot

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,000
of things

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,000
the css syntax is pretty cool here

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
borrowed a lot of syntax here from

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
the famous cobalt themes and the

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
taillight themes and then i

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,279
customized how react and javascript

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,399
looks

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,320
in this theme and also php because i am

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
of course a wordpress core developer so

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
there you have it folks

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
uh have at it go ahead to your

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
extensions area search for shades of

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
purple

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,720
and install this theme and then select

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
it from here

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,560
vs code is equally accessible from the

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
keyboard

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,839
one of the most important keyboard

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,720
shortcuts you're going to want to know

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
is command shift p or control on windows

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
you can also find

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
it written here when you have no file

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,920
open let's go ahead and press it command

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,920
shift p

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
this is what we call a command file you

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,839
can find all of these

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
uh commands that you can run from vs

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,279
code right here

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,240
for example let's say i want to open the

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,639
settings area

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,399
for vs code i'm gonna type settings

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,160
and there you go and it can also do a

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,959
fuzzy search for example remember when

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
we change this

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
vs code theme and we opened a color

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
theme panel

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,160
so i can do c theme and there you go

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,720
references color theme so again command

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,519
shift

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
p and there you have it there's a lot

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,000
more you can do

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,519
with this command palette i'm going to

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440
save it for another video

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,360
right now remember the most important

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,320
keyboard shortcut in vs code

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,720
is command shift p

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
i switched from sublime text to visual

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,600
studio code

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
and the first thing i did was install a

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
key map press command shift p

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
to open command palette and search for

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
key maps

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
here you can find a bunch of key maps

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,079
while i'm interested in the sublime text

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
keymap you might be interested in the

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
one

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,279
from web atom or notepad plus plus i'm

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
going to install this keymap so

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,680
microsoft has built this sublime text

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,079
scheme app

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
and about half a million users are using

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,360
it this keymap

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,680
is actually going to map the keyboard

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,279
shortcuts in visual studio code

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
in accordance with the keyboard

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,680
shortcuts i had in sublime text so it is

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
going to make it really fun for me to

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
switch from sublime decks to visual

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,399
studio code so click

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,360
install and then press reload you can

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
actually see

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
what this sublime text schema

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
contributes it contributes a lot of

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,680
keyboard shortcuts

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,760
which you already have built a muscle

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,720
memory for while using sublime text so

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,720
right off the bat

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,399
after installing sublime text keymap i

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,800
was quite productive in visual studio

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,920
code

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
after searching from sublime

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
a couple of years ago just like you i

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
was trying to learn

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
all these power user workflows today is

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
your lucky day because

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
i'm going to teach you how to deal with

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
lines how to juggle with words

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,240
and how to do those multi-cursors thing

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,639
if you know what i mean

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,240
anyway before we start i need to tell

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
you that i am using mac os

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,880
and when i say command that should be

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,720
control on windows or linux or other os

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
and similarly when i say option you

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
should know that i mean alt

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,440
on other os let's begin with our first

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,519
power user workflow first thing first

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
our current workflow is line iteration

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
let's say my cursor is here and i want

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,160
to go

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
here i have seen developers press the

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,240
right key and hold it till they get to

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,079
the end that is no way to live your life

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
you need to use the command or control

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,440
key see when you press and hold command

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
and then press the right key it jumps

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,199
the cursor to the end of the line

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,199
similarly when you press and hold

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,959
command and press the left key

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,320
you're at the start of line that is

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
pretty cool idiot

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,160
the next thing you do is how do you go

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,399
word by word

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,240
making your creature go after each word

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,320
let's say you want to add something here

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,440
what i would do here is i would press

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,519
alt and then right see how it is jumping

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
the cursor after each word and when i'm

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
pressing the left key

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,399
it's moving backwards so let's say i

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,880
want to say something like

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
power pro and then i go back and then i

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,160
delete it

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,199
okay that makes sense now what if you

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,440
need to select

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
while you are iterating over this line

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,199
well for that

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,880
you can add shift to the mix for example

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,440
press and hold command

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,399
along with shift and when i press the

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
left key

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,560
all of that line gets selected and

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,720
similarly when i press and hold

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
alt and shift and start moving to the

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,800
right

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
i'm selecting each word one by one and i

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
can go back by the left

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,920
that's pretty cool now let's move to our

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,600
second workflow our current workflow is

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,440
how you can delete a line i've seen

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,959
people select all the line and then

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
press delete that is nowhere to live

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,920
your life what you can do instead is

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
your customer could be anywhere let's

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,199
say in the middle of the line here all

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,240
you have to do is press

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,040
command shift and k and boom the line is

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
gone

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,639
command z and let's delete the first

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,519
line command shift

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,040
key go on it's not in your clipboard or

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
anything you don't have to do

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,399
cut over the line or anything just

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,199
command shift

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
k and it's gone the next workflow here

00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,839
is

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,519
how can we duplicate a line well this is

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,519
a fun one maybe you are writing a

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
javascript object and you need to

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,319
duplicate

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
the key value pairs what you need to do

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,760
is you see your cursor could be anywhere

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,439
in the middle of the line

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,400
all you have to do is press alt shift

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,199
and down duplicate this line down that

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
line

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
or you can also duplicate this line

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,000
above that line

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,400
if i press alt shift and up

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,720
the line that gets added is above this

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,799
line this next workflow is very simple

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,360
but i've seen developers who don't know

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,000
how easy it is to cut copy paste a line

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
in visual studio code you can have your

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,720
cursor

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,240
at any place you don't need to be at the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
end of the line or at the start of the

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
line

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
your cursor could be placed here and you

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,480
would just

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
press command x and then line will get

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
cut or

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,880
you can press command c to copy this

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,120
line

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,080
go to another line and then just press

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,679
command v

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
there you have it one more thing that

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
i'd see developers doing wrong

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,360
is they feel the need that they need to

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,559
move to the start of the line they are

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,120
going to paste a line

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,559
that is not true for example i was here

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
i pressed command c

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,720
now i can be here in the first line and

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,720
when i press command v

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
you see the first line becomes second

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,120
line and the

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,480
first line moves down i don't need to be

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,520
at the start of a line

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,520
so i'm here press command v i'm

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,000
at the end of the line press command v

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
see that simple

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
let's see how easy it is to move a line

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,320
up and down for that my cursor is in the

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,120
third line here i'm going to press and

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,640
hold

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,679
command and control and when i press up

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,799
my line the entire line will go up up

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,960
up up and then down down down see

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,280
press and hold command and control and

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
then up and down keys are here to serve

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,320
you

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,400
sometimes what you need to do is you

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,360
need to select the next occurrence of a

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,160
similar word

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,039
for example you see there is this user's

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,960
word here

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
and what i need to do is i need to

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,559
change the first two words

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,360
the first two users so what i'm going to

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,919
do is my cursor could be anywhere inside

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,400
or at the end of this user's word and

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,720
i'm going to press command d and

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
this user word will get selected and

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
when i press command d again

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,039
the very next iteration of that user's

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
word will get selected

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,600
command d again and there you have it

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
and let's change it to something like

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,559
user

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,919
what if you want to select all

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
occurrences of a word

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,039
for example here's this user word i want

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
to select

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,799
all of these all of these users

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,240
words and change them to something else

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
for example customers

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
make sure your cursor is around or

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,520
inside a particular word that you are

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,799
about to change

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,440
now press command control in g

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
and all of those words that are users in

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
this current file

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
will get selected now we can change them

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,919
to let's say

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,919
leads see how easy is that

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,600
let's learn how to move your selection

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,679
to the next same word

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,880
for example i have selected this word

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
students but really

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,480
what i want is to be able to select the

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
very next

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
student's word in the entire file of

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,000
code there could be a bunch of code here

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,200
between this and this so let's select

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
this student's word

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
now what i need is to select this one

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,640
the second one

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,320
okay so i have already selected the

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
student word what i can do is i can

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
press command k

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
and command d and it will select the

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,360
very next

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,159
word students similarly command k

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,120
command d

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
now my selection is here see command k

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,720
command d

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,400
that's pretty cool now let's talk about

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
one of my favorite workflows the

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
multi-cursor workflows we are going to

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,960
be using the mouse or keypad

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
for this multi-cursor workflow let's say

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,480
you want to change

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,559
all of these background colors to us one

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
single similar color what you can do is

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,400
you can press

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,799
you can press and hold command and then

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
click

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,640
wherever you want see my cursor is

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
growing in size and

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,400
now i can select it and make it white or

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,880
whatnot

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,240
again press and hold command and then

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,360
click see

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
now all these areas are editable i can

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,520
also drag

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,159
a multi-cursor for that i need to press

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,720
and hold

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
command and shift for example let's say

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
i want three cursors

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,919
here here and here so let's put our

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,799
cursor here

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,960
press and hold command and shift and now

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,600
drag this cursor down here

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,240
now i have these three cursors i can do

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,400
it in

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
a much larger way as well for example

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
let's put our cursor here

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,679
press and hold command and shift and

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
drag it down to here

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,360
see how many cursors we have one cursor

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,159
for every line from 7

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,200
20. what if you want to create a

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,360
multi-cursor

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
with keyboard without even using a mouse

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,400
or keypad

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,400
well you can do that very easily for

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
example let's again do the same thing

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,720
here change the background colors of all

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,280
these buttons

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
to buy tomato i'm going to press and

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,919
hold

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
command and all and then i'm going to

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
press the down key

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,039
now i can select them and tomato here

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,080
tomato is a real color

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,360
now i can press escape to escape out of

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,760
these multi-cursors

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,520
similarly i can go up as well press and

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,080
hold command and alt

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,400
and press the up button there you go

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
that's pretty cool

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
and now let's do the multi-cursor

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,559
selection thing with just keyboard

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,280
what i want is three cursors here here

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,280
and here

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,480
i'm going to use keyboard only to do

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
this so i pressed

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
shift and then down down down to select

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,039
these three lines

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,679
now i'm going to press command shift and

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,760
l

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,919
and boom there are these three cursors

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,799
that we needed let me do this again

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,520
shift and down to select these lines and

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,720
now

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,799
command shift and l there you go

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
we have as many cursors as we want let's

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,919
select all of this file with command

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
a and command shift l will put cursors

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,760
after

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,240
every single line that's pretty cool

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,280
so the last one here is how to undo the

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
last cursor

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
imagine you wanted to change these

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
colors you pressed

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,799
command and all and then down down down

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
and there is this extra cursor that you

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,919
didn't need

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,360
press command u and it will undo the

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
last cursor action

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,280
command u command you similarly if you

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
were going up

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,720
didn't command you command you command

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,760
you will just

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,600
undo the last action of your cursor it's

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,919
also true for your mouse and keypad

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
click here select command and shift and

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,760
then drag it out here

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
we didn't need this last one so i'm

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,679
going to press command u

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
and there it's gone and that's about it

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,279
i hope you enjoyed my talk today

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
and learned a bit about vs code and some

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,960
power user workflows

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,200
i've already gone ahead and tweeted the

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,799
