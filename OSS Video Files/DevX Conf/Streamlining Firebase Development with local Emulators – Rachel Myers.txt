Title: Streamlining Firebase Development with local Emulators – Rachel Myers
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	People love Firebase for making every read or write just an API call away. What they didn’t love was that, for years, the only development environment where you could reliably test changes was a duplicate Firebase project. It was expensive, prone to mishaps, and required an internet connection at all times. This is the story of building local emulators that let a developer set up a new Firebase dev environment in about a minute, and the mistakes we made along the way.
