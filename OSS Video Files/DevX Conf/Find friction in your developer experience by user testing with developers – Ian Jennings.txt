Publication date: 2021-04-26
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Do you know what's stopping developers from getting started with your product? Developer experience testing exposes the developer's point of view as they get started with your product. You don't need to be a UX researcher to start gathering feedback today. This talk will show you how you can run your own DX test in minutes with free tools.

hey this is ian jennings and this is how

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,400
to find onboarding friction with

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
developer experience testing in this

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
talk you'll learn how you can use

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,039
developer experience testing to find the

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
problems that are stopping developers

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
from getting started

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
with your api sdk or developer tool

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
again my name is ian jennings and i'm

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
the founder and ceo of hacksaw

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
developer experience testing before that

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
i've spent about six years as a

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,160
developer experience engineer at pubnub

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
and before that i co-founded a hackathon

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,719
organization

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,399
platform called hacker league which we

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,320
later sold to intel so i've been in this

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
space a really long time just really out

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
of pure

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,079
passion and love for coding so what is

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
hacksaw hacksaw tests and measures your

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
developer experience with on-demand

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
feedback

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
from real developers really all that

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
means is we're doing uh user testing

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,960
with developers on your products

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,520
and a lot of people call it

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,799
usertesting.com for developers

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,760
these are some companies we've worked

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,799
with sap amazon snapchat ring central

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
cinch and a bunch of startups and the

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,360
learning from working with these

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,799
companies is what

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,040
informs a lot of the recommendations

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,240
that we'll make in this talk

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
if you've never seen a developer

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
experience test this is what one looks

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,080
like

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,240
and really it's just a video of a

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,119
developer getting started with an api

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,880
sdk or devtool so here we can see a

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
developer using tesseract.js

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
they're you know on a github docs

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,119
they're getting started they're about to

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
copy and paste probably the cdn link put

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,960
it in your ide

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
and if you are a product manager or

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
someone responsible for developer

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,600
experience

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
you are probably responsible for what

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
this looks like right

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
you're in charge of making it faster and

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
easier for developers to get started so

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,759
that you get more developers and

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,759
developers are happier now um

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
we find a lot of companies have never

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
actually even seen developers use their

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
product especially new ones

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
so you might be looking at your

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,200
analytics you might be looking at your

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
maybe bug reports or support team to get

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,160
feedback from developers but you've

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
never really seen one

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
use your product start to finish so

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
that's what developers testing is all

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
about

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
it's watching a developer get started

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
with your product start to finish so you

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,560
can identify

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,080
all the little issues and friction they

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
encounter along the way

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
fix those issues and make it better for

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
developers who

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,879
the next developer is going to get

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,879
started

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,720
so to recap why do we do developer

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,920
experience testing it is to find out

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,200
what prevents developers

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
from getting started with your product

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
if we break that down a little bit the

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,239
reasons for developer experience testing

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,319
uh the most common reason is to

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
establish a baseline like i mentioned

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,200
most people have never even seen a

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,480
developer get started with their

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
products so just

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
you know seeing that for the first time

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
can be really amazing it can be kind of

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
stressful and frustrating too

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
because you've probably been ignoring a

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
lot of these issues you've never even

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
heard about them

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,560
so a lot of companies who choose to

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
start developer experience testing are

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
trying to gain an understanding

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
once they've gained an understanding

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
they've found that friction they can

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
watch developers get started they want

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
to use that information to make

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,720
changes so you're going to find out what

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
happens make a bunch of changes

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
and ideally those changes will increase

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,000
signups those signups will make

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
trials and trials will make money and

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
you'll be the hero of your company

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
because you have found the reason

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,599
developers weren't getting started

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,959
with the api so

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
how do you conduct a developer

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,879
experience test it

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,159
is not like software testing so it's not

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,360
automated it's a very you know it's a

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
human process

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,560
but it's not very hard and i think you

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
can get started in probably about two to

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,879
three weeks

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
from start to finish um to get started

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
here we're going to actually go through

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
each of the steps one by one and i'll

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
help you define your first developer

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
experience test so hopefully

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
by the end of the month you'll have your

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,239
own uh test all

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,599
done so uh let's get started here the

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,000
first step would be to define your

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,000
audience

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
you're going to say who's testing the

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,840
next step would be to write your test

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,280
script so what are we testing

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
finally you're going to run that test

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,239
and then you're going to review it

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,560
summarize and prioritize

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,359
changes let's dive in okay

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
so starting off we're going to define

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,639
the target audience now you can see here

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,600
there is a

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280
requirement column and a recommendations

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
column so a requirement column is kind

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
of the variable

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,759
and the recommendation is going to be

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,479
what we think the you know a really good

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
starting point

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,960
uh for you would be based on our own

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,840
experience at hacksaw so

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,840
uh requirement first off uh most common

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,440
question is number of developers and

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,040
five is a really great starting point

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
recommended by user experience

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,080
research for qualitative studies the

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
reason

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
is that five people going through the

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
same flow

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,880
will expose about eighty percent of the

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,440
problems

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
in that flow and any more developers

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
you're just going to get repeat

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
problems so it's going to provide you

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,039
with uh

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
a really good balance between like

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,759
coverage and value

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,520
right so um

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,560
moving on i you know start with five

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,560
it's easy if you have if you're

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,720
ambitious go to 10 go to 12 but

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,400
if you go to 20 you're getting into um

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,759
maybe quantitative

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,759
studies where you're going to have a lot

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,639
more uh informed and

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,919
calculated metrics but you're going to

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
see a lot of friction and that's not

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
what this talk is about we're talking

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,039
about friction points

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,960
problem areas stuff like that so five

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,639
easy good starting point

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
now language um go for the most popular

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,039
language

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,560
the reason is what we're trying to

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
emulate at least in this talk

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,440
is the most common flow for getting

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,680
started right so what is the largest

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
market that we can emulate in this test

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,560
and typically that's going to be

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
the largest programming language with

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
the most common api doing the most

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,720
common thing with the api because that

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,280
is going to make the biggest impact

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,880
into your um developer experience right

00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
it's going to have the largest impact on

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
your company

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
and and numbers because it's reflecting

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
the largest portion of

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,440
your target audience so if that's the

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
goal here

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
you should start with javascript or java

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,800
because those are the two most popular

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
languages now you might not support

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
these i mean you probably do but you

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,199
might not maybe you're

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
you know python shop or something go on

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
python so it's up to you but if you're

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
you know if you've got 70 sdks start

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
with javascript or java

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
as for experience we're talking about

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
the experience of the target audience

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
here

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,800
again and we recommend three years

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,560
experience the reason being is you don't

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
want developers to get stuck because of

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
their own

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
ability right we don't want developers

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
to get stuck doing npm install

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
because they've never done npm install

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,880
before we don't want someone who's doing

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
java for the first time

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
because they're going to get stuck on

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,360
all different things that don't even

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
relate to your api

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
now three years is a good balance point

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,919
because people have um

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
enough experience to you know to get

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,960
over those um little problems things

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
that aren't

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,759
related to your api but they're going to

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
be inexperienced enough where if you

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,440
don't hold their hand

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,240
they're gonna trail off it also

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
represents

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,919
the largest market again because there

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
are far more inexperienced developers

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,199
than there are

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,120
experience developers now special

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,240
requirements this includes like ide

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
or platform or ram right so if you're

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,880
doing like a machine learning api

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
or something and you need to have a

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
whole you know big video card or

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,039
something to get started

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
you want to note that just make note of

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
it because you don't want to waste your

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,199
time recruiting people

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,039
who are on a macbook air and can't run

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,400
it anyway

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,680
um so moving on another really big topic

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
here is previous experience with our

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,560
product again

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
you probably have a lot of data points

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
with people who use your product right

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
your own developers can critique

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
the product they made you know you have

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
your customer support team who's

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,560
who knows the problem so there are a lot

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
of problems there that you've heard

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,000
about and it's more valuable to go after

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,520
new developers because

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,080
you don't have you typically don't have

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,240
access to those as easily

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
now um big one here is incentive so

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
developers aren't going to do this for

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,360
free unless you've got a great brand

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
so or you got a good t-shirt to give

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,199
them out or something good credit so

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,720
uh most likely you're gonna have to

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
provide some kind of incentive for

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,879
developers to get started

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,080
fifty dollars is a great starting point

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
um this also ties into

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
the amount of time they're going to

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,160
spend so that'll be the next slide but

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,840
50 gift card is really the best point um

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,280
amazon money is basically as good as

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,000
cash these days

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,080
uh you don't have to worry about um kind

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,599
of crazy transactions or you know

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
uh rewards stuff like that you can

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
reward anybody um i believe it's under

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
400 without filing taxes don't take that

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
from me it's not a legal advice but

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,200
um typically if you're you know if

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,399
you're just sending out gift cards

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
you'll be fine

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
um you can also do things like venmo i'm

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
not sure about uh

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
you know what that looks like

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
financially or whatever but like venmo

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
paypal i've seen people do that

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,240
too um you know it's not it

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,519
you can it's way easy these days to

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
reward people

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,040
you might get creative with like

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,640
t-shirts and credits and stuff but tip

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,920
you know cash is king so there you go

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
once you've defined the audience you've

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,959
got your incentive who they are how much

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
we're paying them

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,279
um what are we testing right so these

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
kind of go hand in hand

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,640
but typically you probably have an idea

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
of what you're testing before you

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,839
you know before we even you know at the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
beginning of this test you go oh yeah we

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
should really test

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
at the beginning of this presentation

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
you're probably like oh my god yeah we

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
should really test this thing

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,040
so this is really about defining the

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,040
test details um

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
test length is one hour just start do

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,519
one hour it's a really great

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,959
starting point most people think that

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,480
developers can get started with their

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
api in 15 minutes

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
using the metrics that they collect or

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,680
the analytics but you'll be surprised

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,040
i'm sure

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
most developers won't be able to get

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,320
started within an hour and i know that

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,160
sounds crazy but once you do this

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
testing you'll see that developers

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,000
won't be able to use your product within

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,480
an hour it's i know it's crazy

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,040
um i'm going to skip starting url

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
because that's

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,560
uh i'm going to go right to test script

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
so test script is essentially what are

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,519
developers doing during this test and

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
again i mentioned earlier we're doing

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,880
the most broad thing

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
so if for example if you're a

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,200
telecommunication api

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,959
your getting started guide probably says

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
hey this is how you send an sms

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
and this is how you receive one so

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,360
you're getting started guide as a really

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
good

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,480
judge of what your test should be

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
because it's probably your most common

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,279
use case

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,519
and where you're sending developers

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,519
anyway so you can really just

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,200
set that starting url like i mentioned

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
to your getting started guy and say

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
hey record yourself while you follow

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
this right follow getting started guide

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
send

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,000
sms receive an sms and you'll know

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,200
you're done when you reach the end of it

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
if you have a good getting start to

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
guide

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,480
now if you're testing just like a random

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,680
you know reference documentation you

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
might have to be a little more clear

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
here and say hey

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,079
you know here's our reference docs we

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
want you to um

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,680
you know make an email list and add an

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,959
add an email to the campaign and send

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,959
the campaign out right you might have to

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,240
kind of kind of guide them a little more

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
but the funny thing is is when you make

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
that test script that's guiding them hey

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
that's the route to your future getting

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
started guide anyway

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,279
so by answering these questions you're

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,480
kind of defining your hello world if you

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
haven't already

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
and if you have defined your hello world

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,480
great you don't really need to even

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,480
answer these questions

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,800
again these can be shaped so after your

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
first test you might want to go and

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,959
actually

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,480
um dive into some single guide

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,399
deeper right oh we did it in javascript

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
but now we want to do java let's copy

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
and paste that test script let's copy

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
and paste that test and do it again for

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,839
java

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,920
um another note is like on starting url

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
so i just mentioned too like oh yeah

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,079
send them right to the getting started

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
guide right

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,240
send them to the docs now the broader so

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
if you if you go from getting started

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,839
guide

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
they're going to follow that guide and

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,560
they probably won't do any googling

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,560
unless they have to

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
if you send them to the docs you're

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,519
actually going to be testing the ux of

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
your documentation website and that

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
could be a good thing or a bad thing

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,079
depending on what your goals are

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,680
so if your goals are to understand how

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,639
good your developer experience

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,480
portal is right you actually might send

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,160
them to the home page and say

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,760
hey find the portal find the dots blah

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,880
blah we actually find that to be pretty

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,480
common

00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,839
if your goal is to say hey does our api

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,279
work at all and kind of more test the

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
subject matter and not the guide you

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,160
might actually

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,680
or the guide but only the guide send

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,880
them to the guide

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
now here's the the kicker if you're

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
feeling brave send them to google

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,519
and say hey using our api

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,800
send and receive an sms because what

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,079
happens when you send them to google is

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,279
they're gonna they the world is their

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
oyster now

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,800
and they might go to a medium article to

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,440
find out how to do it

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,959
right so that can be very interesting

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
but you're actually

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,920
losing um some of that high resolution

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
look at your docs

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,000
now you might say why would i ever do

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,639
that that's actually what developers do

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
anyway

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,160
so by only sending them to the readme i

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
mean that's great

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,240
but that's also it you know given the

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,720
chance that they find the readme

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,079
um we have found some crazy things by

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,839
sending people to google like for

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,560
example a company was

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,560
um uh running ads on their own

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,240
uh for their own keywords and a

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,600
developer got stuck in a loop googling

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,880
for answers hitting an ad

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,399
the ad took them to the portal which

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
wasn't helpful and they went back to

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
google

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,160
so this company was paying for ads that

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,800
were actually uh

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,399
not helping the developer while the you

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
know second third and fourth results

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
were actually would have helped them so

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
you can find you know wasted ad spend

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,320
like that

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,880
um let's see another answer to another

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
kind of uh

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,560
finding which everyone loves is one of

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,279
the first tests we ever did

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,200
we sent developers to i think it was

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
probably the portal doesn't matter but

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
um we found that developers you know

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
five out of five developers couldn't

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,959
even get started at all in the

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,480
documentation

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,760
uh sorry couldn't even get started at

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,279
all in the developer portal because they

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,519
had adblocked enabled

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,959
and some kind of metric collection was

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,680
not triggering because of adblock and

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,920
that wasn't

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,279
redirecting them to the next page so

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,720
they never were able to even sign up

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,920
five out of five devs couldn't

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,600
sign up so think about how you're

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
structuring that starting point because

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,399
it will expose different

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,079
parts of your developer experience and i

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,079
would say most certainly

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
do not provide them with accounts if you

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,279
can

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,120
make sure they sign up because there is

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,720
so much friction you have never seen in

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,800
that sign up process and the api

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,000
generation and all that stuff

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,560
which will be extremely valuable to you

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
okay so uh we're about halfway done here

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
and you've

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
set up your test right you've defined

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,320
your audience you've defined what you're

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
testing

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
those kind of go hand in hand now it's

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
time to administer

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,800
the test so um where do we get those

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,920
developers that we talked about in step

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,079
one right

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,360
where are we finding these people well

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,959
if you're lucky you probably have a

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
developer email list that has millions

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
of developers

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,079
right um and that may or may not be good

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
depending on how many you think have

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
signed up so you will really if you have

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,000
a marketing list that might be better

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,760
than a list of

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
trials because right if you're looking

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
for new people there's not going to be

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,360
great

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,120
there's a balance there right how hard

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
is it going to be to recruit versus do

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,040
we want that new user feedback

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
but for the most part you're going to

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
use typical um

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
you know advertising methods and you can

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
ask your marketing department about how

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,839
to get started with that

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
so you know send an email out maybe post

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,959
on

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
linkedin twitter job boards things like

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,920
that

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,440
um you know i've seen devrel departments

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,639
take this over where deveral posts on

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,079
twitter and they post on linkedin hey

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
we're doing a study

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,760
uh you get it you know gift card come on

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,519
help us out

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,760
now when you post these advertisements

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,519
um you want to include the requirements

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,920
and you want to include the incentive

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
the reason is is you do not want to

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,399
include anybody who does not match these

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,920
requirements

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,440
so it's a waste of your time to open

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
that thing up to everybody and then

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,160
screen them

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
screen start you know giving that

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,000
information about what you're looking

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,600
for as

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,360
early as possible okay so

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
say you blast it out to everybody you

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
know you did uh

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,320
you sent it out to a million developers

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,240
give them a screening form

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
so make a form that says you know how

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
much experience do you have have you

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
have

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,120
you used our product before blah blah

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,320
blah don't tell them what the answers

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,079
are um

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,839
you know make sure people are 18 or

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,480
older stuff like that not legal advice

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,639
again

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
um but essentially right you want to

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,360
screen the devs and make sure that

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,959
they're

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,320
matching your criteria in number one

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,160
yeah and you can do that through a form

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
if you're trying to go for five again

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,440
you're doing a real small one

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,199
you can just message them on linkedin

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
hey have you used our product

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,160
you have enough ram right easy enough

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,000
you don't need to worry about all this

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
scaling stuff

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
now we haven't talked about this much

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,399
but in ux testing you have two options

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,079
you can do an unmoderated test or a

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,839
moderated test

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,000
now there's pros and cons to each a

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,720
moderated test is when you do a video

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
call

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
with the developer and the unmoderated

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,440
test is when the developer records a

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,839
screencast

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
the pros of a developer on zoom is you

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,399
get to interact with them

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
you have to ask them questions you can

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,800
guide them if they go too far off

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
the cons of that is that's going to take

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,680
time out of your day to schedule those

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
calls and get on those

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,040
uh you know get on the phone with those

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,000
devs right and it's it's a really big

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,440
process to do that

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
you're looking at a you know we're

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
talking about five developers that's at

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,560
least five hours

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,559
it'll probably take you seven or eight

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
responses to actually get the five good

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,160
ones

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
so be considerate of that but it is a

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
much

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,120
more high engagement right you're gonna

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,120
get a lot more quality when you can say

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,160
oh why'd you choose that or what do you

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,919
think of this page

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
right there's a lot of guides on how to

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,799
do a moderated study for user experience

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
i'm not going to cover them in this

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,880
short talk

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,880
um if you're doing an unmoderated study

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,000
ask the developer to use obs and just

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
record their screen while they get

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,320
started and upload the video

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
to you over email or some kind of form

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,480
or something

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
i'm sure you'll figure out how to

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,320
receive an email through dropbox right

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,160
something like that um and then finally

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,240
you're gonna actually do the thing so

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,160
if you've chosen to do a moderated study

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
when you set after that screener

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
follow up with a scheduler so say hey

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,679
you know we have all these slots for

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,960
next week that's when we're available to

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
meet with you

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,559
they do their robo schedule you meet

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,320
with them

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,320
and you get on the phone and you walk

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
they start doing the test uh you can

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,720
walk them through that task

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,160
right uh and you're just gonna ask them

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
questions along the way don't prod them

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
too much again

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,240
look up how to run in moderated study um

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,520
otherwise if you're not doing a

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
moderated study you can just say hey

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,919
record your screen and get started and

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
send us the video and if

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
it looks good we'll send you 50 bucks

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
right you don't have to really worry

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
about that all

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,039
um the downside of an unmoderated study

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,559
doing that screen recording is they can

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
go do anything they want

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,280
they can go do crazy stuff you never ask

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
them to do you don't know what they're

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
going to do so

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
you might have a lower uh you might need

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
to find more depths

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,360
right because you might have throw some

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,160
away because people just did crazy stuff

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,280
now um i think i covered that all in

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
administration there

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,360
uh typical tools here again for a

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,520
moderated study go for zoom

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
zoom has cloud video recording so enable

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,880
that on your account

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
and if you're doing unmoderated obs is

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
the best bet

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
the reason being is it records high

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,720
resolution and high resolution video is

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,240
important for developers

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,000
who have like 4k screens right um

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,600
if you i'm not going to get into that

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
but there's a lot of cam

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,640
screen recorders that cut off after a

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
certain amount of time they don't record

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,200
high resolution

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
all that stuff so just go for the high

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
res

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,600
let's see finally reviewing the results

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,080
so let's bring up that

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,440
graphic just for fun and imagine the

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,720
developer test went well you've got a

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,400
bunch of videos right we can see the

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,880
developers getting started

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
what you want to do is then watch those

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,000
videos or the notes

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,160
that you took during those recordings

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,280
and analyze all the friction points

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,960
right you're going to start to see

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
trends or oh wow five

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
out of five developers couldn't get

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
started because of adblock or something

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
like that right

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,600
you'll notice those trends right away

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
you're going to make

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,280
lists of those those issues the trending

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,520
issues

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,320
um google doc whatever you do notepad

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
whatever you need

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,160
just make a list of them and keep track

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,720
of the developers that encountered them

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,160
right when you're done so what we have

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
here on this slide is essential of what

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
it looks like when you're done

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,240
you're going to rank those issues based

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,919
on how often they're encountered and how

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
early in the flow they're encountered so

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
basically if

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,240
you know five out of five developers

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,080
encounter an issue signing up

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
that's going to be a super high priority

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
item because

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,280
it's guaranteed developers are going to

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,200
hit that if one out of five developers

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,960
encounters a problem at the last step

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
it's like yeah i mean that might be a

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
problem but it's a pretty low priority

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,200
right

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,720
compared to the first one so try to look

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,559
at the number of devs and how early in

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
that flow that is

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,080
um typically you're going to find

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,960
problems in authentication getting

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,240
api keys getting started signing up and

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,080
navigation i mean those are the most

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,400
common ones

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
so this is an example of what a test

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,020
results might look like

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,159
so for example here we have

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,440
[Music]

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
developers on the free account were

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,720
unable to send more than five

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,320
messages right so developers are let's

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
imagine uh we did our testing you know

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
we got a bunch of recordings of

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,679
developers trying to send an

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,640
sms message and we can see that um after

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,760
five messages they

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,200
they encountered problems right so going

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,200
deeper into the notes or description of

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,840
that issue what were the problems well

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
developers run the script every time

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,240
they want to debug right they run the

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
script they run the script they make a

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,000
change they run the script

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
after five executions they hit a limit

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,840
on the free account

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,360
and they get say a 403 error with no

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,880
error message right so

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
to you you might have implemented that

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
issue um so you might have implemented

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,679
that

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,200
restriction you know for security

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,640
reasons anti-spam

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
and you're like oh yeah five is enough

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
for developers to get started but when

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
you actually look at it

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
developers go through those five

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
messages in 10 minutes because they just

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,159
keep running the script

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,280
or maybe they even use a live reload and

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,919
they just run that script every time

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
they make

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,280
you know they save the file so though

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,200
you'll see how

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
the expectations that you set match up

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,720
with how developers actually

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
act and you might not have seen this in

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
analytics right

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,840
now five is low it's probably higher for

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
you but you still might see these sorts

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
of things

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,000
another part of this issue here is that

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
let's say you return to 403

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,440
for bid and this is actually from a real

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,039
test that we did so imagine you turn a

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
403 instead of uh

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
an error message right well the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,919
developer's confused because they see a

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,120
403 and they don't see

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,360
a your trial account is limited to

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,159
five you know messages i see a 403 so

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,280
they're really confused

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,799
when you're looking at the test results

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,559
when you're watching those videos

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,240
these things will become clear i made

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,480
them up here and we're not looking at

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
any real results obviously but

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,159
you'll see the developer will go hey why

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
do i get a 403 all of a sudden that's

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
crazy

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,799
they'll go why you know i've been this

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,600
has been running fine why does it why

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,679
did it stop working

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,039
and you might even know the answer right

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,000
at that time don't tell them what the

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,039
answer is just keep

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,640
going let them see how it goes using

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,159
this information that you found now

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,080
you're going to propose

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,960
solutions right so

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
you might have already thought of

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
something in your head as i described

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,120
this right easy increase the number of

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,400
credits on the free plan go from 5

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,679
to 50. next solution well how about we

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
also include an error message with that

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,039
403 so even when they hit the 50

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,240
they know why right and then finally

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,600
maybe you provide a notice in the

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
documentation about the limit before

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,760
they hit it so there's

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,760
that's a three-prong attack on this

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,960
issue right we're going to

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
you know reduce the number of times

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,679
people encounter this issue we're going

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,520
to inform them when they do

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
like at the moment they do and we're

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
also going to inform them before

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,120
that they might hit it so that will

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
improve your dx because the next time

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,400
someone comes through they're not gonna

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,559
you know they're not gonna hit that that

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,880
five out of five limit

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,760
so the most important part of this whole

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
thing

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,039
and really what's going to tie up this

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,280
whole talk is that we're making

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,120
data driven decisions here right and a

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,880
lot of developer experience right now

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,400
you might feel this in your own company

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,559
are shouting matches about what people

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,240
believe how they feel

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
support and how often they think they're

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
getting issues versus what product

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,520
thinks is important

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,120
the thing about dx testing is that it

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,320
puts all the internal conflict aside

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,679
it's not about your company or what

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
people think or who wants a raise

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
anymore

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,279
this is about the developers and what

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,720
they report the problem is

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,559
so the most important thing here is to

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,200
cite the source

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,760
so wrapping it all up the sources says

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,279
hey

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,880
we hired this person named morgan

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,320
looking down here at the source

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
they have three years experience and we

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,240
know that because we collected the

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,600
information

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
from that screening form they spent 10

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,400
minutes trying to

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,840
you know debug this error five minutes

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
searching google for an answer

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
and then 10 minutes to create a second

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,520
account to avoid the error

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,760
imagine this happen right then what you

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,520
do is take that video file either on

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,159
zoom you know the obs file whatever they

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,080
uploaded

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,640
and you're going to say watch this at 23

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
minutes where this happens

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,840
so you're going to go through every

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,240
video identify the time period at what

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,440
some

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,679
at the point that people encounter

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,400
friction identify the issue and

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,799
offer solutions now you have a list at

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
the end of the day of prioritized issues

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,400
and proof that they're issues with

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
statistics that say hey this is you know

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,880
one out of five two out of five five out

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,520
of five

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,960
five out of 30 that are going to show

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,480
you that are going to inform your

00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,840
product

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,320
and you can't argue with that it's

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,679
giving you solid advice on how

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,279
to guide your product and make

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,000
developers lives easier from the

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,120
developers

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,919
themselves right the other great thing

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
about this too

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,480
is it beats conway's law where this is

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
no longer a department

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
by department thing you might have

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,880
noticed i talked about portals sign

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,559
up error messages right no

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,320
those are all different teams probably

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,080
in your company but when

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,600
a developer doesn't care right developer

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,440
sees the full experience

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,440
start to finish all the and doesn't care

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,600
about the individual teams

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
and it will expose how those teams work

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
together and where they're failing to

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,200
work together or where there's

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,559
miscommunication right

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,559
which team is lagging which one is

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,480
causing is marketing causing problems

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,480
for that sign up page right is

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,679
documentation failing to inform the user

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,240
of a future error they're going to

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,679
encounter

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,919
the developer does not care about your

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
internal structure so

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
this is really what i believe to be the

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,799
answer for improving your developer

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,640
experience overall

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
and i really hope to see it adopted by

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,400
every developer company out there

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,840
it's really insane to me that most of

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,159
these companies have never

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
seen developers use their own tools

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,480
right i mean this is a product this is

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
like

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,080
a giant industry and this developer's

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,760
time is very expensive

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,520
right if you're wasting their time

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
you're wasting money basically and

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,880
they're going to go to competitors

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,080
who's where their time isn't wasted um

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,679
i'm not going to get into that i want to

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
show you the chart you have competitors

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,559
now

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,679
people i don't know what else to say uh

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,120
there was a time when you didn't have

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,640
competitors and it didn't matter

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,640
dx matters now because they're you know

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,320
developers will just go somewhere else

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,279
um in conclusion in my conclusion

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,880
uh despite my criticism here in my final

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,400
conclusion

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
these are not problems or opportunities

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
right so the most important thing here

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,600
to remember is you're

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,520
going to be tearing down your developer

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,480
experience you're going to be

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,640
finding every problem that your dx has

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
every product and every mistake

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
every organization has made in your

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
company by doing this right

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,720
and when you go present these results

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,159
it's very important that you don't

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,840
take that in a negative light or put it

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
in a negative light make sure

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,880
you're saying hey we're giving a

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,320
holistic

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,080
overview of how we're going to improve

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,799
this dx and it's gonna and it's gonna

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
take

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,880
effort from the whole team right we're

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,200
gonna we're gonna work with everybody

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,279
to improve our dx across the board and

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,640
that is really what i think to

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,360
be the also one of the biggest struggles

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,200
for dx is you need to essentially align

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,840
all those departments

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
to get on board with making developer

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,279
experience easier

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,000
and so this is how you do it again

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,000
