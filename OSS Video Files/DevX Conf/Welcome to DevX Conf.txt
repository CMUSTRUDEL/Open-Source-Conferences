hello everybody and a very warm welcome

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,560
to the first staff xconf ever

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,439
a conference purely focused on developer

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
experience

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,359
a topic that i think we're all

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,760
passionate about as it affects our

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,400
day-to-day work like no other thing

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
and a topic we also believe deserves far

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,440
more attention

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
my name is johannes and i'm one of the

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
co-founders of getpod

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
and together with the rest of the getpod

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
team as well as the speakers and all

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,079
great human beings that attended the

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
conference

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
we'll be hanging out during the next two

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,200
days on discord

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,160
which you can quickly access via

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,000
redirect at get pod io slash chat

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
i have to admit that it was incredible

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,520
fun to help build a conference and

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,520
community

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
that is purely focused on developer

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
experience we also got a lot of

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
encouragement along the way

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
which helped with the fun part but

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,119
before we dive into specifics

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
we'd like to take a step back and give

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,760
you some background on why

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,560
we came up with the conference idea for

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
that

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,960
it is important to understand that the

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
reason why gitpod exists

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
is because we were and still are

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
frustrated with the developer experience

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
status quo

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
the team behind getpod built developer

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
tools for the past 10

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
plus years and all of them have been

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,560
open source and the most recent one is

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
skatepart

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,200
a platform that helps you automate the

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
provisioning of development environments

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
so developer experience is really at the

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,680
core of almost all decisions we make

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
when it comes to product design

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
go to market strategy etc it's even one

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
of our core attributes at the company

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
and if you look around there are more

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,200
and more projects individuals and teams

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,720
such as getpod that are almost obsessed

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
with developer experience

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,920
and with the fax conf we want to unify

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
their voice

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
as developer experience is also

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,719
sometimes used as an umbrella term

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
what do we actually mean by it and why

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,000
the hell do we call it dev x and not

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
dx put in very simple terms

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
devx is the experience of a developer

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,160
when she tries to get the job done which

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
encompasses her whole workflow

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,000
and all of that should be efficient

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,640
should be sustainable

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
and should be joyful and if you want to

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
dive a bit deeper into the concept

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
we highly recommend you reading the

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,560
great article from christoph around the

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,360
principles of developer experience that

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,480
is linked

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
at the slide now to the price issue wide

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,480
fx

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
there is the kind of smart answer to it

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,440
and there's the

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,720
not so smart one and for now i will only

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,319
give you the smart one

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
and we can chat about the other one in

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
discord

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,200
a lot of people refer to developer

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
experience as dx

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
in reference and close reference to ux

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
but we believe it should be a more

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
standalone term that is more descriptive

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
and has a better reference to the

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,280
developer as a specific

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,840
not a general user i hope you understand

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,640
us and that makes sense

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
unfortunately the status quo in death x

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,080
is not

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
that efficient and joyful the myriad of

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,760
new tools released

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
every day initially sounded like the

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
promised developer land

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
but also led to a continued

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,440
fragmentation in the industry

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
on the one hand that is great because it

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
gives us choice

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
but it also makes our lives increasingly

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
difficult

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
what happens is that developers need to

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,159
chain

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,480
oftentimes not really orthogonal tools

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,200
together with brute duct tape

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
there is this psychological concept of

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
tyranny of freedom

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
and happiness reaches research that

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
describes the current situation

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,879
quite well opinion if you're not so much

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
into psychological concepts

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
the guy in front of the cncf landscape

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,080
also brings the point home

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,640
steve from redmonk will have a great

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
talk

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
later today about what he calls the

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,080
developer experience gap

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,080
but luckily there is light at the end of

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,200
the tunnel and individuals

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
teams projects and companies start to

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
think deeply

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
about how to reduce friction and

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,479
essentially turn that

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,440
duct tape into a swiss clockwork and

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,479
fxconf

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,479
is for them and aims to unify our voices

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
towards a better developer experience

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,639
when trying to get the job done what can

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,759
you expect from the next two days

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
primarily i hope a lot of fun personally

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
i'm really looking forward to all the

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,280
insight from our great speakers and

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
engaging discussions on discord

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
topics will cover developer experience

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,520
along the whole software development

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,080
lifecycle

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
from develop collaborate test build and

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
deploy

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
to running software you can find more

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,000
information about that

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,400
at fxconf.org schedule

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,680
without further ado i'd like to hand

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,320
over to christine

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,680
who has been doing an amazing job and

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,400
organizing literally

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,440
all of this without her the conference

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
wouldn't exist

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,120
so thank you christine and the stage is

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
yours

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
thanks johannes hello and welcome

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
everybody to devxcon also from my side

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,160
my name is christine and it has been a

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,600
pleasure organizing devexcon one thing

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
that's really special about this

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
conference

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,639
is that it's a non-profit event and that

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
we will donate all surplus to open

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,360
source projects

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,080
and best of all all the titles can take

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,160
part in it

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
and decide where the money is going to

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
go to

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
in total be having ten thousand dollars

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,440
that will be distributed between open

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,840
source projects

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,680
to take part in the vote you can simply

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,400
go to devexconf.org

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,520
slash open source authenticate via email

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
or github oath

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
and vote for your favorite project

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
let's have a quick look why it's

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,680
actually necessary to support

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,000
open source projects for that i find

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,720
this image

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,880
explains it really well currently

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,160
developers rely on many tools that are

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
built and maintained

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,080
almost exclusively by unpaid open source

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
maintainers

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,720
and we got to support these projects to

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,039
make sure our infrastructure

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,960
won't collapse furthermore we would like

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,639
everybody to be able to contribute to

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
open source projects

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
not just the people with the right

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
financial background that can afford

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,400
paying the resources

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
and taking the time for it

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,639
we think it's time to start giving back

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
if you would like to know more about

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,440
this initiative please have a look at

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,840

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,080

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,440
open source starter kit by very cell it

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,360
was a great great help to
