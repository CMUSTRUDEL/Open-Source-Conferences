Title: Using Observability to improve the Developer Experience â€“ Borja Burgos
Publication date: 2021-04-26
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Observability is often associated with production and live environments, but it shouldn't be! In this talk we'll explore innovative ways in which modern observability tools and best practices can be leveraged during development to: improve developer productivity, identify regressions earlier in the SDLC, and increase the performance and reliability of our CI/CD workflows.
