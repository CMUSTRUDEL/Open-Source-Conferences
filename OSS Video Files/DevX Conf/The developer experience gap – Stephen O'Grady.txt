good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
depending on where you are as you hear

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
these words

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
i am stephen o'grady i am the co-founder

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
of redmonk

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
redmonk if you have not heard of us is a

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,920
developer-focused industry analyst firm

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,199
and what that means in practice is that

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,440
we spent a lot of time

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,320
thinking about essentially developer

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
needs

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
developer preferences developer trends

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
because it's our belief

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,200
that that is essentially what's driving

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
the technology industry today

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,440
and what we wanted to talk about

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
essentially was something that we've

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,239
come to call the developer experience

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,760
gap

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,840
now we'll get into what that means we'll

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
get into sort of the particulars and

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
and at the end of the presentation some

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,039
things that we think can be done to

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
address it

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,960
but just at the top i think it's worth

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,199
you know just spending a second

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,199
to talk about why you know we think it's

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,560
an issue talk about sort of the level of

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,720
the problem

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
and you know one of the things you

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,799
probably won't be surprised to hear

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
as a developer focused industry analyst

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
firm is that

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,119
we spend a lot of time talking to

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,439
developers and you know

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
one of the things that has come up over

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
and over

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
and over again in our conversations uh

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
you know with

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
practitioners frankly across the board

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
is

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,079
this sort of low level uh friction you

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,159
know this

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
this essentially these these issues that

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,720
are always there

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
that tend to fall in between the cracks

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,119
and

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
you know it's the kind of thing that we

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,680
as an industry and certainly developers

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,640
sort of more particularly have tried to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
learn to live with

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
you know to some extent and you know

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,079
because you know there's a

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,759
there's an element of this where you

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,920
know developers being developers they've

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
automated everything they can

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,680
and so any any aspect of the experience

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
that can be attacked programmatically

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,119
has been

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
and yet you know there sort of remains

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,759
these these

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,840
um you know these gaps you know if you

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,200
will

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,160
between uh you know the the different

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,040
tools in between

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
you know sort of the the pieces that we

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,879
use to build infrastructure today

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,319
and you know the the result is you know

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,360
just a really sub-par

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
experience and you know so we'll get

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
into sort of

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,000
why that is and how that is and as i

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
said before

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
you know what we think might be done or

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,000
it might be possible to do

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,040
uh to address it so you know the

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,040
the first step is

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
you know when we think about sort of the

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,720
experience right

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,239
what is that what does that mean what do

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,040
we when we talk about experience what do

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
we mean

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,480
and the example that we we tend to use

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
is so this is

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,360
steve jobs on stage in january

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,360
of 2007 and he's introducing

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
the iphone uh surprisingly i thought it

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
would look a lot different you know than

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
it does today and

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
of course it is different but not not as

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
radically as you might expect um

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
but anyhow you know sort of focusing

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,879
sort of more particularly on

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,080
you know the example here you know prior

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,840
to prior to

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
january of 2007 we obviously had um you

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
know we had

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,239
music players you know we had cameras we

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
had phones we had all the sort of

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
different things that make up an iphone

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,319
and in some cases we had them on the

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
same device right there were phones that

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
would play music and and so on

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519
and if you think about the experience

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,799
that you were used to

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
uh at least those of you who uh

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,000
those who have been around long enough

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
to remember those

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,040
you know it was almost as if these these

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,200
tools

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,480
had been designed by you know completely

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,280
different teams that had nothing to do

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,640
with each other

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,920
all right so you know the music and

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
phone just wouldn't work together

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,599
because they weren't designed that way

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,439
which is what made that experience with

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,879
the first iphone you know so

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,360
memorable right so uh it's so novel

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
uh you know frankly it was a revelation

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
and

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,879
you know so you know everybody

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
i would assume listening to this has had

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
some experience with this at some point

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
it's very difficult

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,040
to get away from phones is that you know

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,720
you're listening to music

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,919
you know call comes in so what happens

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
the music fades out you pick up the call

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,520
when you're done with a call the music

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
fades back in

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
now on paper this is pretty simple right

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,800
this is

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,240
yeah okay this is exactly how we would

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
you know sort of you know draw this up

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
this is not rocket science this is not

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,840
you know some impossibly complicated uh

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
you know

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
experience to deliver and yet it just

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
wasn't the standard

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,000
and it wasn't the standard because you

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,960
know we had all these individual pieces

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
that had to be integrated together and

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
there was

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,720
you know much less oversight of what

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
experience do these pieces in the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,759
aggregate deliver

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,800
to an end user and that was and sort of

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,720
arguably still is

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
you know sort of apple's genius it's not

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
a matter of hey i could deliver the best

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,759
music player or the best phone or the

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
best

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,440
camera or whatever they're thinking

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,479
about sort of the experience

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
qualitatively in terms of okay what is

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,720
it like to use these these individual

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
pieces

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
in conjunction with one another in the

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,039
aggregate

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,479
and you know that is something that you

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
know has

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
you know it's a lesson frankly that this

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,479
industry still needs to learn

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,440
on some level which brings us to

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
heroku now heroku many of you sort of

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,240
may be familiar with

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,759
uh was a property currently owned by

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
salesforce

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,520
bought by salesforce in 2010 it was

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,759
founded way back in 2007

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,919
and you know what heroku represented

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,000
from an industry standpoint

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,199
was essentially a break you know from

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,479
uh the norm at the time so

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,360
about five months before uh steve jobs

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
stood on stage

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
with his iphone the uh you know folks

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
from amazon

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
came out with you know a a couple of

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
different

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
uh primitives if you will first it was

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,199
storage in march of 06

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
the simple storage service s3

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,580
later in august of o2 was the elastic

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,759
compute cloud

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,360
[Music]

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,280
and you know these two services

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,039
you know basically kicked off the cloud

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
era right and obviously they've been

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
followed by

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
uh not dozens but literally hundreds of

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,120
different services um which is

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
in itself uh an issue as we'll talk

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
about but

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840
you know the that was sort of the advent

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,160
of this

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
you know era which was dominated by you

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,440
know here are the primitives

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,120
you know you developer you know use them

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
and go build what you will

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,479
heroku represented a sort of

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,560
fundamentally different approach

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,160
which said okay what if we took some

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
off-the-shelf

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
you know projects and technologies you

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,080
know things like the postgres database

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
you know rails is a framework um you

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
know git as a versioning and deployment

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
mechanism

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,880
and brought them together to deliver a

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
different quality

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
uh experience to to try to think about

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,080
not just

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
hey how does git or postgres or you know

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
rails or

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,720
whatever work individually but what is

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
the experience

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,199
overall that they represent to customers

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
so you know heroku has has done fine you

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
know it is

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,960
it's too constrained it's too

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,520
opinionated you know for for

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,360
many in the industry but you know it has

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,800
consistently throughout the years

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,400
you know delivered a certain quality of

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
experience

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,639
now you know the interesting thing to us

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,759
at redmonk

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,199
is that you know when we look at this

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,319
you know we are in a position where

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
you know heroku represents uh you know a

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
certain ideal

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
but certainly it's not as if it's taken

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,080
over the industry it's not as if it's

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,400
ubiquitous

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
and yet you know over the last you know

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,520
probably about 18 months

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,879
you know we've heard more uh chatter you

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
know in the industry we've been

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,960
asked more about heroku than the entire

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
decade prior

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
so what accounts for this sort of

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
otherwise inexplicable surge in interest

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
it's otherwise

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
uh you know really surprising and

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,199
unexpected

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,039
um you know renaissance of heroku you

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
know not even necessarily as a company

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,840
but as an idea

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,440
and you know we have a you know a couple

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
ideas on that

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
so on the one hand if you think about

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
the world that we live in today

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,880
it is it's a golden age for developers

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,640
right in the sense that you know we

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
talked about the primitives that amazon

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
launched

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
uh you know which kicked off the cloud

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
era so anything you want as a managed

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,600
service compute storage database

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,120
sort of what have you uh you can have as

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
a managed service

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
and importantly there are more arriving

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,480
by the day all right so my colleague

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,000
james governor talks a lot about

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,240
progressive delivery

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
you know which is this idea that you

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
know you can

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
you know sort of you know test things uh

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
progressively

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,320
you know sort of across um you know

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,680
rollouts you know so

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
you know blue green deployments you know

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
can area rollouts and so on and so forth

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
you know it used to be that you'd have

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
to build that uh you know if you wanted

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,320
that kind of functionality now

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
you know it's just available to

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
developers you know who want it

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,920
and you know there are many other sort

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,519
of contributing factors here open source

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,000
continues to explode of course

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,399
you know we have this huge array of of

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,160
projects at our disposal

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,120
that you know represent a huge huge uh

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,959
you know essentially win you know for uh

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,080
developers right because they have this

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,399
this essentially inexhaustible library

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,720
of

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,240
assets and resources and services they

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
can bring to bear

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,480
on any given problem which is great

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,440
but you know one of the issues is that

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,440
it is

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,800
not uh an unmitigated good

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,480
so uh if you are a gen xer

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
and you grew up in the united states i

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,720
have no idea how this plays in

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,120
in other geographies uh you might

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,240
recognize the source of this gif

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,519
uh if not it's from a 80s television

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,959
show called

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
the a-team and for reasons that i don't

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,200
understand at all

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,480
um there was a montage sequence

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,320
in every episode of the a-team

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
in which they had to get together and

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,040
take all these individual parts

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
corrugated or uh iron there you know

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
some

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
you know some regular flat pieces of

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,120
metal cones

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
whatever and they had to weld it screw

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
it

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,399
um duct tape it wire it together to form

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
whatever i think in this case it was

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,959
like a tank who knows

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
the point is is that you know this was

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,160
you know taking a bunch of primitives

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,720
and assembling them by hand to build

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,399
something else and that effectively is

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,040
what we have told developers

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
they have to do and they have to be the

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,399
industry

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
you know as long as uh certainly as long

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,440
as the cloud has been around

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,720
has de facto told developers you have to

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,800
be the a team

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,399
you got to take all these pieces you

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
have to put them together

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,360
and not just put them together but you

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,560
are responsible for

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,200
their assembly but also their operation

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,720
their maintenance and their support over

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
the long term

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
and you know that is just a you know

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
it's a

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,720
it's a problem um because

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,880
what you end up with excuse me is

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,519
uh you know essentially you end up with

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,000
a gap right you end up with

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,399
well okay i have these individual pieces

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
and then collectively

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,839
they don't work all that well together

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
right um

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,680
you know i have these this this constant

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,600
low-lying friction

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,760
of trying to make these pieces work

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
together of trying to be responsible for

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
operating them

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
trying to be responsible for their

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
integrations

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,279
and you know we're back to a world where

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,760
i have a music player and i have a phone

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,480
and nobody's really thought well about

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
how to

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,680
sort of make these two pieces work

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
together

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,920
so you know then the logical question is

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
okay even if we sort of acknowledge that

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,600
this is a problem

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
what's who cares like why why is this

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,639
important and

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,320
you know really what we tell people is

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
that it's important for a very simple

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
reason

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,440
right which is that um you know this is

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,360
a quote from andy jassy

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:41,440
uh andy uh is obviously gonna be the

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,440
next ceo of of amazon um

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
but this is you know from his time at

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
aws

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,959
and it's a quote from a couple of years

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,480
ago and what it essentially says

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,880
is that the success of aws

00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,320
uh is and has been uh delivered by

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,600
uh developers developers are the driving

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,880
engine of you know amazon uh as

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,480
you know aws more specifically as an

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,800
organization

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
and i think it's reasonable i think we

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,000
can probably all agree

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,440
that amazon is not a small organization

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,240
and that amazon is sort of in many cases

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,720
driving

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
you know trends that impact and affect

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
the entire industry

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,399
so if developers are as important to

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,360
amazon

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,360
as they are to you know sort of the

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
industry as a whole

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
then sort of logically you would infer

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,639
that you know

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,760
they are an enormously important

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
constituency

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,720
um you know for everybody you know

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,079
regardless of where you work you know

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,920
regardless of what kind of organization

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,480
you're a part of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,079
so if developers are that important you

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,760
know therefore

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,600
well one of the things you might want to

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
do is try to eliminate friction

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
uh you know from their day from their

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,639
process

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,760
and you know that is something that you

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
know you will

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,959
sort of want to take a look at you know

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
sort of over the longer term

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,880
because you know one if you can you know

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,279
sort of get them

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,560
you know get developers focused on uh

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,920
you know sort of what

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,360
uh you know the basically writing code

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,440
if you can address the developer

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,839
experience gap for them

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,160
they're going to spend less time duct

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,199
taping baling well you know

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,519
wiring welding and so on and more time

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,800
writing code that makes them

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,959
it makes them happy it makes them

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,120
productive so they're happier

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
your organization moves more quickly

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,680
therefore everybody wins

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
so if we if we can acknowledge that this

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
is a problem

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,519
if we can acknowledge that the problem

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
is important you know the logical next

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
question is

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,279
what do we do about it right and

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,120
you know there isn't going to be one

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,959
answer right there's not going to be

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,720
sort of one solution to this there's not

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,480
even going to be one approach to this

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
they're going to be a bunch of them we

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,560
don't have time to talk about all those

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
today

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,079
what we do have time to talk about

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,399
however is

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,160
characteristics of what we feel you know

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
solutions regardless of sort of what

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,839
approach they take

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,279
are going to have in common and the

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,880
first of these is that they have to be

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,600
comprehensive

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
right so the days of of you know sort of

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,760
being able to sort of just focus on

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,959
one tiny area of uh you know the

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,240
the developer tool chain and you know

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,959
try to be

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
you know so focused on that that you're

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,360
ignorant to everything that's going on

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,759
around you

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,759
uh those days need to be over right you

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,800
can't just come in and say i only do

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,320
this one thing

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,639
whatever happens outside of this

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,639
particular space is somebody else's

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
problem that's not going to work

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,759
so the solutions themselves have to be

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,480
comprehensive

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,680
now it doesn't mean that any one vendor

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
is going to be able to

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,480
offer everything that's required that's

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,440
you know not likely to happen anytime

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,399
soon

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,959
uh but the solutions have to at least be

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,600
sort of

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,680
self-aware enough to say look people

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
often use this service in conjunction

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,839
with this two

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,399
you know these two three four five other

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,800
services and

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
i need to go further than just a oh hey

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
we have a partnership and the apis work

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,800
together

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,560
you need to think about what is the

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,120
actual experience

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,959
of using these things together right

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
because we've all had that

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,480
you know we've all had that experience

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
at some point where

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,480
you know you're you're using you know

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
sort of pieces of software and there is

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,440
theoretically an integration

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,680
and you're sitting there saying has

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,079
anybody actually used this has anybody

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,800
actually

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,519
tried this and you know it's such a

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
common

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
sort of breakdown and experience these

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,839
days

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,079
that you know literally anything that is

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,880
sort of more thoughtfully

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,560
approached and integrated is really

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
going to turn heads so the solutions

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,880
here

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,959
can't be sort of siloed they have to be

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
comprehensive in nature

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,120
so likewise they have to be developer

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,759
native uh so what does that mean

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
well this you know the background here

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,160
is a

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,919
is a tool called marp what marp is is a

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,480
tool that you know essentially does

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
uh slides and you can output slides in

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
powerpoint or pdf or

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
you know a variety of image formats but

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
you design the slides

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,319
in the context of visual code or visual

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
studio code sorry

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,600
so you know basically it's a it's a

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
developer native

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,600
slide tool um you know for for lack of a

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,520
better term

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,280
and this is the standard you know it's

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
not we don't obviously need to focus on

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,000
slides it's not a

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,679
developer's primary output but the

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,400
example here i think is worth

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
emphasizing because basically you're

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
going to want to work with

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
you know the tools that are popular and

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
used by developers vs code being sort of

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,080
you know perhaps one of the best

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
examples

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
in the industry today uh you know the

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
days of being able to say hey i have

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,200
this interface you come to me

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,720
again are over you you know whatever the

00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
solutions here are going to be they're

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,000
going to have to be

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,000
natively integrated into the tools that

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
a developer is going to use day to day

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,919
they have to be developer native by

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
design

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,600
likewise they have to be elegant right

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
so if you think back to that

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,039
you know the the iphone example that we

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,919
used earlier uh

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,280
that is you know sort of inarguably an

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,480
elegant solution

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,320
right it is just simple it's uh you know

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,160
a solution that is delightful you know

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,400
from a user standpoint

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
because it works how you'd expect you

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,320
know the the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,280
music fades out take a call music fades

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,440
back in it's

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,799
again it's not brain surgery it's not

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,880
rocket science

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,799
uh but it is an elegant you know

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
tasteful solution and the thoughtfulness

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,160
of that design comes through

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,240
and that's always been appreciated by

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
developers you know it is you know if

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,120
you look around the industry at

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,360
platforms that have been successful

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,880
if you take a github as an example

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
github is a lot more than just

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
hey we can host your git repos right

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
github has

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
you know done many things over the years

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
you know that are

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
uh you know elegant in nature right the

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,200
aesthetics that go into it the

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
thoughtfulness of the design

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
um you know for the tooling you know

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,400
which is not to say it's always perfect

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,240
but those are the kinds of things that

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
are appreciated you know by developers

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,760
you know that that sort of elegance and

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,240
thoughtfulness and sort of

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
uh attention to the aesthetics uh you

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
know are going to matter

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,600
and are going to be important to to

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,080
include and to think about and to focus

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,160
around

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
you know as we think about um you know

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,799
solutions

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
you know for this developer experience

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,240
gap

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
uh you know likewise it needs to be

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
multi-run time uh

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,919
you know if you were designing a

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
solution you know frankly if you go back

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,080
to 2007

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,600
you know when uh the

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,200
uh you know heroku was was first

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,160
developed um

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,559
then you could design you know single um

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,960
or

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,880
sort of very few runtime solutions uh

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,520
because that was the standard

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,160
you know many many years ago um you know

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,320
when

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,919
when i was out sort of as a system and a

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,360
systems integrator myself

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,280
you know most of the shops i dealt with

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,840
were either java shops or microsoft

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,240
shops

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,440
um it might do a little bit of both and

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,720
of course there's always you know tons

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
of other stuff running in the background

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
that

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,320
nobody pays enough attention to you know

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,240
pearl and otherwise

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
but basically most of these shops were

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,640
you know one or two runtimes tops

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,240
in terms of sanctioned uh languages

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,159
that's just not the case any longer

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,919
right so the backdrop for this is our

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
the plot that we produce you know twice

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,720
a year

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
uh for our redmond programming language

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,480
rankings and as you can see

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,919
you know when you look up at the uh

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,919
upper right hand

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,280
uh of this chart excuse me

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,440
you know there are a number of different

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
uh you know examples of of

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,200
um you know languages that are

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,720
enormously popular right so javascript

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,440
obviously is sort of taking over the

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
world

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
you know python and java are huge but go

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,039
further down the chart

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,799
um you know dart and rust are two

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,720
languages for us that are coming up

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
um you know kotlin has already done that

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,480
go did that sort of before

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
and you know so you know typescript is

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,120
you know a huge huge gainer

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,919
so the point here is is that

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,360
whatever the solutions are going to be

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,640
excuse me

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,320
uh there are absolutely going to be

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
multi-run time in nature you're going to

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
have to support

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,640
um the different languages and the

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,480
different uh runtime uh

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,919
you know platforms that developers want

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,120
to use

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
certainly don't need to support every

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
everyone on this chart but you know

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,400
you're going to have to be pretty

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,120
flexible

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,919
in terms of what you accommodate and

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,280
then lastly

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,440
you know we've already sort of touched

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,840
on the fact that it is extremely

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
unlikely that any single vendor

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,280
uh is going to deliver everything that's

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,360
required uh

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,840
you know for a um

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
you know for a sort of integrated

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,960
developer data tool chain

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,760
there's just too many moving pieces too

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,760
many services

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,480
excuse me um so

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,320
it's just not going to happen therefore

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,360
you know nobody's going to be in the

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,799
position of apple right where

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,559
they control the runtime they control uh

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,640
the music player and they control the

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,799
phone app

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
what's going to be required is a bunch

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
of vendors are going to need to come

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
together

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
and think about again sort of a wider

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,039
world than just their particular space

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,880
and think about the experience what is

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,120
it like to use these together

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,640
how does that work how elegant how

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,640
thoughtful how comprehensive

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,280
is that experience um and that

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,799
ultimately is going to be

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,480
you know what's going to define winning

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,039
workflows from losing workflows you know

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,360
regardless of approach

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,360
so with that um and not least because i

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,080
appear to be losing my voice

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
uh that is essentially where what we're

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,039
what we're thinking about the developer

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
experience gap at present

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,440
and some some suggestions in terms of

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
how to address it

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
uh okay you know with that you know

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
here's a uh

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
a couple ways to find me i'm not

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,000
terribly difficult to find online

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,640
and again i'm stephen o'grady co-founder

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,320
redmonk

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,320
