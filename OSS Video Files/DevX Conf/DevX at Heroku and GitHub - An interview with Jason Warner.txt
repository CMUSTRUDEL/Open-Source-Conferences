okay

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
hello everybody out there um i hope you

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,520
already enjoyed the sessions with eric

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
gamma with alan and with mael and i'm

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,880
now happy to

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,720
welcome jason the cto of github for a

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,119
quick fireside chat about developer

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
experience so thanks for taking the time

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,079
and welcome to the hacks confrontation

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
um i mean i'm actually quite excited i

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,960
think this is my first

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,000
fireside chat in jogging pants so

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
how are you today i'm good it's a nice

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
sunny day over here where i am and i

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
already got out for a nice walk with the

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
uh

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,160
little puppy we have so great that is

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
what what kind of puppy do you have

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,160
so we um we got a bernice mountain dog

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
and she's about nine weeks old at this

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,840
point so full of energy but also

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,879
showing her future size already so we're

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
in for

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,000
extended treat with this one nice that's

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,119
that that sounds that sounds like fun

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,880
times

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
so i think maybe it makes sense to do a

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,159
brief round of introductions

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,759
and if you don't mind i'm happy to start

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,759
so i'm johannes one of the founders of

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,240
gitpod the company that actually is

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,560
behind this conference and

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,920
i mean want to keep it brief so actually

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
i think that's it and my

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
career is also not as long and

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,640
accomplished and impressive as yours

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
jason so

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
so over to you here well i think the

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
long part is what you were keying in on

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,640
there

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
um so um yes i'm jason warner i'm the

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,439
cto at github

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
i've been github about four years at

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,320
this point prior to

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,439
github i was the vp of engineering for

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,079
heroku where i ran virgo engineering and

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,040
product for about three years and then

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
before that

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,479
i ran engineering for a company called

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
canonical

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,840
people who make ubuntu linux so i was in

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
charge of ubuntu for

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
five years and before that was a host of

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,800
other companies that um

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,120
are as interesting as those three cool

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
yeah um so and very very relevant i

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,239
think because you really saw the whole

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
um the whole developer experience kind

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
of movement from the

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,599
beginning and to where we are now and

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,080
where we're headed in the future

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,280
so i think the kind of goal i have for

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
the conversation

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,879
is to yeah allow myself but i think also

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
the audience to learn and also mainly

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,120
listen to some of the

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
more war room stories you experience

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
throughout your career

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
and potentially also extract one or the

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,239
other tactical advice

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
and i think for either teams that are

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
building tools for developers such as

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
getpod

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,319
or teams that want to increase their

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,160
developer experience and productivity

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,720
of their own engineers right

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,760
so to to start i'm kind of intrigued

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
what was the first

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,920
piece of software that really felt

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
magical to you in terms of developer

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,640
experience

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
so there's pretty simple answers here so

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
i got

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
into computing quite late i didn't

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,120
actually start programming until i was

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
um going off to college i didn't have a

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
computer at home and all that so

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,319
you know i didn't really start

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,800
programming until around mid 90s

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,040
which and then you know by that time i

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,799
started doing internet programming and i

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
then i think that the tools just weren't

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,159
that great to be honest with you

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
even microsoft hadn't been developing

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,840
great tools at that point

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
so it took me a while the first really

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,440
magical tool i think i ever saw

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,799
was rails when rails came out

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,239
and we saw that video that dhh put out

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
there for the blog

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
kind of blew my mind i was stuck in java

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,159
land for a long time

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,840
ejb 2.0 i people who follow me on

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,480
twitter know how i feel about

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:02,640
ejb 2.0 j2ee this all that sort of stuff

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,599
then after that it was um

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,799
get pusher rook master get push heroku

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,599
master heroku

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,200
blew my mind in so many different ways

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
and that is what led me down the rabbit

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,159
hole

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,000
of developer experience cloud developer

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
oriented tools platforms all those

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
things in general

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
so the one i'm most obsessed with is get

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
push heroku master because

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,600
for its time it literally was a

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
spaceship being sent down to

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
a very primitive population as far as

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
i'm concerned and still the best in the

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
industry of what it does

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,880
yeah yeah i fully fully fully agree and

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
i mean that actually leads leads quite

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
well to the

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,800
to the to the next um topic which i

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
think it's fair to say that you know

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
heroku was among

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
the first orcs that were really

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
obsessively focusing on developer

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
experience

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
and i think to date is probably still

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
the example like a lot of people

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
reference right around that topic um

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
similar to

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
to yourself i mean you headed their

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,360
engineering efforts for i think

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,600
more than three years correct yeah so um

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
what do you think what was kind of baked

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
you know into the

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,199
heroku culture that really nurtured

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
and or enabled that that that focus back

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
then

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
you know we didn't have the words for it

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,080
at the time but i think that

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
people at heroku had that customer

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,600
obsession that so many people talk about

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,960
on a daily basis now but we just we just

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
talked about it being deaf first

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,639
like developers are touching this every

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,840
day we need to understand

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,080
what they're doing why they're doing

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,800
what their pain and frustration is

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,800
so one of the very very obvious key

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
things was that everyone at roku almost

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,039
everybody was a developer and they used

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
the product on a regular basis and they

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,160
wanted to get better

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,880
and i will go back to 12 factor the 12

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
factor app

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
i think again this goes to how forward

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
thinking i think heroku really was

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,360
breaking down not just that the

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,720
experience was there but how to

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,199
construct an application

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
for a modern a modern web application in

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
a way that makes it very sustainable and

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
can grow horizontally

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,479
and i think that with getpushworkmaster

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,880
and that obsession with developers

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
really was one of the secrets to heroku

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,280
i also think it was one of its biggest

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
frustrations

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,440
then too because the world didn't always

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,800
work the way that we

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,880
hoped it would in some cases

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
and we hadn't evolved the product to the

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,240
point where it would

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
be able to encompass get push roku

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
master with

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
the multitudes of the ways in which

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
developers in the world were going to

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
work

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,600
yeah that that that that makes makes a

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,919
lot of sense

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,440
any kind of um more detailed um stories

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
you can you can share about that

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,479
frustration there and what maybe also

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,240
has changed

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,720
right now well so the so i joined heroku

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,599
post

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,479
acquisition by salesforce yeah so um a

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,160
lot of the

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
pre-acquisition folks were still around

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
though the founders were not

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
and one of the interesting things that i

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
saw was

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
just like any startup as it grows

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,360
there's a very early cohort a mid cohort

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
and a late cohort and i was part of the

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,400
mid cohort let's call it people

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
who wanted the spirit of the early but

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
you wanted to scale it

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,240
and i think one of the interesting

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,919
things that we saw as a frustration was

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,039
inside of salesforce a lot of the focus

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,120
necessarily changed to a set of things

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,080
that didn't allow us to complete the

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,520
mission

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,520
the first part of heroku was done that's

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,000
what got it acquired but the next three

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
four five

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
steps that we wanted to do never really

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
panned out and they would have allowed

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
us

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
to become the serverless heroku or the

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
kubernetes heroku or a bunch of other

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319
things

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
but because we couldn't do that we

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,879
basically we basically boxed ourselves

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,479
into a corner of the market that we

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,440
could serve

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,319
and when you take that and then you

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,039
start to

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,960
ramp up the revenue pressures you stop

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
focusing on how to expand

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
and innovate and just really how to

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
increment

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,400
and i think that frustration got to a

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
lot of people including myself which was

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
we know we can do more and we're serving

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
a set of people but we're not broadly

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,039
serving them so

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,319
my classic example that i talk about all

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
the time is

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
there is a person in the middle of the

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
country whatever country you're in

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,319
who is underserved from a um product

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,520
perspective because there's not a lot of

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,879
money in their market but they're a

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
developer who goes to work every day

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,879
hoping to make a living

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
most people don't have that person as a

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
persona they want to serve

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,240
heroku wanted to they wanted every

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,120
developer around the world to be served

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,560
by them

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,800
and we just never were able to fulfill

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,839
that

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,159
okay but others still i mean um

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,760
as you described heroku was really

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
developer first and probably one of the

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,640
first

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
companies probably they had no words for

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,920
that but

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,279
that really lived that right so what do

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
you say they're kind of two

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,560
three really tactical things um you

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
learned

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
during your time there that other

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
companies can adopt and can learn from

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
that actually build an engineering org

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
that puts

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
developer experience at the center and

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,399
at the core of their product

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
and building efforts well so one don't

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
try

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
my opinion is don't try to find a way to

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,880
quantify the value

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
of developer experience it's going to be

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,360
very difficult to go do just

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,399
figure out that developer experience as

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
part of who you are

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
and why you're going to serve and what a

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
differentiator would be it'd be like

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,560
apple saying um our design aesthetic is

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
valuable here's how valuable it's going

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
to be they just

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,080
you know they just know that apple just

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,200
knows that this is part of who they are

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
what they're going to go serve so just

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
do that

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,399
the second is um this was a shortcut i

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
learned from somebody at roku i

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,640
loved simple design specs and this

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
person

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,560
um basically designed everything with on

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,000
heroical in the command line just showed

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,000
command line

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
heroku new features running and this is

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,560
how it's going to work and then you

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,600
figure out everything else

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,080
behind the command line running and it

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
took

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,800
it took away distractions what you know

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,399
what x y or z is going to go to another

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
this is the developer experience they're

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
going to touch it this way they're going

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
to feel

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
it this way we did the same thing with

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,959
the dashboard mockups when we were doing

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
um cicd stuff

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
and pipelines we just we didn't talk

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,519
about some of the derivative effects of

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
it we said this is what the experience

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,399
that's going to be it really helped us

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
focus

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,600
and then a couple more things tactically

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
is do not

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
try to be everything to everyone right

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
out of the gate just won't work

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
pick a cohort people that you really

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
want to go serve um

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,279
and then serve them but um there's a

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
concept of called ten to a hundred to a

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,560
thousand raving

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,320
fans really camera at home build that

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
out get ten people who just can't stop

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
obsessively using you

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
and are talking about you build that out

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
to a hundred build that out to a

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,040
thousand

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,279
um and even more tactically speaking

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
you're going to have to have some sort

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,320
of conviction

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,079
around some element of what you do that

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,200
will feel a little bit counter-intuitive

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,200
in all likelihood or is is different

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,399
than what is happening in the market or

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
open source or wherever um but

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,240
understand why don't have

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,200
religious dogmatic conviction around it

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
have some

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
some sort of pragmatic we can verify or

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
talk to people who can help us

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
understand if this is

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,279
indeed something that we can actually go

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
and do

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,959
yeah that makes that makes a lot of

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,440
sense when you speak about this

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,480
kind of i'm picking the first and 10 or

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
100 people

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
and there i think this is also something

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
we really saw

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,360
at getpod that if you want to have that

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,040
frictionless experience you cannot build

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,600
it for everybody right especially

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
especially in developer tooling um how

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,640
would you say how

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
how do you kind of approach that should

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
you grow with communities or how do you

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,079
you know

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,480
pick that kind of niche there this is a

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
it depends answer entirely based on what

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
you're building

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,959
so if you're building something where it

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
makes sense to go with a community and

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,720
you know rails or

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
next or a gas fee or whatever figure

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
that out and then go

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
to that community and go build with them

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,160
if you can if it's a language

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,279
or if it's an ecosystem maybe you're

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
building something that just works

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,560
inside

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,839
amazon or azure or gcp ecosystems or

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
you're doing something that's broad

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,600
sweeping across the java

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,360
landscape as opposed to the specific

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,760
frameworks

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,839
all those things will likely change but

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
what doesn't change is inside of there

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,120
inside those communities the ecosystems

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,920
or whatnot

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,079
there's what you can call anchor either

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,480
anchor people or anchor pillars or

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,000
anchor services so a good example is if

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
you're building amazon stuff

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
understand who you're building or

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,160
building on top of the amazon ecosystem

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
for people who are

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
doing things like roku or whatnot well

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,839
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,200
of the value can be derived from some

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,639
subset of services

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,639
so don't focus on the five percent

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,079
service focus on the 55 value service

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
and that and because what's going to

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,120
happen is you box yourself in too

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,000
early so um you know kind of understand

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,639
what you're building and how you're

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,760
building it

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,800
and also find every community this is

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,880
going to sound a little bit like

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,480
instagram influencing and i

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,079
guarantee you people are going to

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,639
land-base me for this one but it's

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,480
it's actively actually true there are

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
taste makers in every community

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
and if you understand who the taste

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
makers are in that community

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,959
you can understand that community really

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,760
well

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,120
and there's not thousands of them

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,160
there's likely not hundreds it's

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,680
probably dozens

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,120
maybe even less than that just

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,880
understand those folks and what they're

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,480
trying to go do and engage with a couple

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,079
of those folks and what you're building

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,680
and you'll get high high density high

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,519
yield feedback

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,800
yeah that's i think the last one that's

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,680
that's really really well

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,959
valuable and tactical advice um probably

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,959
we should move a bit

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,120
away from the kind of product building

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,839
focus in dev tooling

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,160
and look more in towards and kind of

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,519
into organizations and the

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,959
developer experience that um orgs

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,800
essentially provide to their own

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,440
developers that means

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,480
ensuring that my devs are as productive

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
as possible

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
what would you say what is um today kind

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,240
of github's answer to that

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
to that um question we we use github to

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
build github

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
um just like we use roku to build github

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
so

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
github at this point um mostly uses

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
their own

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
room tools to to build it um we have our

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
we have our own uh obviously of actions

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,959
we have our grown internal ci cd we have

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,399
our own pipelines all that sort of stuff

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,600
um i would say that um

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,600
i'm very privileged to have worked at

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
github and roku and to see these things

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
firsthand

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,320
probably see some of the best of the

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,079
best in terms of their internal tooling

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
what i will say is this i'll say most

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,120
organizations don't have a great

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
internal tooling story

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,360
um what a lot of them do is end up

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
trying to recreate

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
a heroic like experience internally not

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
using roku but building on top of

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,920
kubernetes or

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,000
something else that's kind of cobbled

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
together i would encourage those folks

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
to think about

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,560
um taking that more seriously because a

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,720
developer's productivity internally and

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,800
their experience with the internal tools

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
goes a long way to their satisfaction on

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,279
the job and also just honestly their

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
efficiency

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,480
if you have a build system that takes 30

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,399
minutes to run

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
builds as opposed to two minutes as

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
opposed to 30 seconds as opposed to

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,199
incremental fractional builds

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
you you're going to have a very

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,600
different experience and engagement with

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,600
work

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
now one of the things that i think our

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
industry does poorly

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
which i think will happen will get

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,839
better over the next couple of

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,360
um years is um we will understand

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,560
developer productivity and efficiency

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
more and i don't mean like big

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,519
brother-esque like

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,480
is johnny or sally or susie productive

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,399
i mean hey we were able to do a thousand

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
releases today we were able to

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,959
fractionally deploy and migrate x y z

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
services or whatever

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,959
um so a couple of key metrics that i

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,959
care about here are i like

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
cycle time and i like mean time to

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,600
recovery and i

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,839
not because they're super valuable

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,480
metrics but because it takes

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,240
a lot of effort to understand if you can

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,279
do a thousand releases a day or two mean

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,920
time to recovery

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,279
down minimally speaking there's a lot of

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,560
effort that goes into your entire

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,480
internal development pipeline

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,079
internal development systems to get

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,720
those things um

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,240
running smoothly and i think that those

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,519
are good ways for you to start tracking

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,040
whether or not you're doing well

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,959
or not there okay that that that makes a

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,600
lot of sense um

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,240
so i think for a lot of devs that work

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
in

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
certain orgs and care about developer

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
experience it's probably sometimes hard

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,920
to justify to work on that because it's

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,399
you know not part of the actual stuff

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,639
they're working on

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
which oftentimes probably most likely is

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
a function

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
of how to quantify it and i think the

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
metrics

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,240
you mentioned there they they they they

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,279
potentially help

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,399
um help in that but are there any other

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,519
things and where you say hey do that

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,920
um and tell that your vp of engineering

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,240
or

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
kind of um what what would you like to

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,920
give developers

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,040
um and at their at their hands to

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,440
essentially

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,639
um justify to work on on developer

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,639
experience

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,480
so this is a very difficult question i

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,679
think unfortunately for me to answer

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
because um i find that you this is a

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,799
little bit of a

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,600
binary situation the organization

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
understands

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,679
developer experience and developer

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,120
productivity or it doesn't it doesn't

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,959
and if it doesn't your what metric could

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,959
you possibly give them

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
to start selling them on developer

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,520
experience this is almost like we're in

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,199
the dark ages

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
in some organizations and sectors of the

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,360
industry imagine going back to the 50s

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,640
or 60s to talk about sales efficiency

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,160
because it didn't quite exist yet the

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,160
entire concept didn't

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,080
quite happen but it happened in the 80s

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
sales efficiency even 90.

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,679
so i think that much of the industry

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
understands this and they'll spend money

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
on dev tooling

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,400
but it wasn't even less it was less than

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,840
10 years ago

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
when most people said you can't make

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,640
money in dev tools and now obviously the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,160
golden age

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,760
for devtools because people are starting

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
to realize that you know

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,799
this is happening um one last story and

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
then i'll give you actual tactical

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,160
advice here too but

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
when i started my career i was at ibm

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,679
and i remember when i started

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
i looked at my pay stub and it had like

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,640
this code on it and i looked

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
asked somebody what it was and said oh

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,280
that's cost center you are a

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
cost to ibm like well i'm a developer

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
i'm like

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,720
creating the thing that everyone's

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
selling like yeah but we think of you as

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
a net negative like

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,360
from a balance sheet perspective it'd be

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,080
better because you don't generate

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
revenue

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
and it was like super head stretchy i'm

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,600
young i don't know what i'm doing like i

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
don't understand this like how

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
yeah i don't generate revenue but i'm

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,280
generating the thing that generates

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,799
revenue that somebody goes and sells and

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
i think that that

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,039
mentality is not gone in the industry

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,240
yet in some cases like

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,080
wouldn't it be better if we didn't have

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
to have all these costly engineers on

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,240
staff

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,679
to build these things so you know i

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
think that and when if you find yourself

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,080
in a situation like that it's going to

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,640
be frustrating

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,640
my tactical advice to you is understand

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,400
what the organization values

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,200
if it values um just pure dollars out or

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,799
if it values

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
features and functions being released

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,440
and that sort of thing talk about those

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
things

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,080
in conjunction with this so if it's

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
features and functions and release

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,919
cycles

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
talk about the fact that developer

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,160
efficiency is low

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,360
leading to confusion or too large a

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,039
cycle time or

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,039
you can understand your org better and

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,320
kind of create a narrative around it

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,000
metrics are going to be harder to come

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,840
by but you can probably find them too

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,080
but use the ones that matter to them

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,039
not to you that's going to be one of the

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
most important things

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,039
you do yeah it makes a lot of sense

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,080
looking at the time a bit um and also to

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,559
to close

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
our quick chat the final question is

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
what area

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,840
do you think will significantly kind of

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,160
also advance developer experience in the

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,520
next two to three areas or

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
which area are you most excited about

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
i think a couple of things are going to

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,720
happen in together

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,039
i think the entire data landscape is

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,919
being rewritten on the fly right now

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,360
i think if you look at snowflake and

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,480
what it's doing for data warehouses and

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
the kind of derivative things that are

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,799
happening there but if you've got

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,039
you've got snowflake you've got dbt

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,000
5 train like the entire data ecosystem

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,440
is being

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
overhauled on the fly not to mention

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
when even once you get into the ml and

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,760
ai space

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,640
over there for for those things so i'm

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,679
pretty interested in what's going to

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,240
happen there i think

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,679
they'll start to get more um tooling

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
around their specific needs which i'm

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
very excited for because

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,400
as far as i'm concerned that is they're

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
on the archaic and if we're on the

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
medieval end in the developer land data

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,520
is on the archaic end

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,640
um escape i think that we'll see some

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
people try and take another swing at

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
heroic

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,240
it hatches out um and i think that we'll

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
see more and more cloud native

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,760
stuff happening you've got get pod we've

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
got code spaces we've got things that

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
are

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,440
out there i think we'll try to bring

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,520
more of that cloud native

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,320
feel to um to developer experiences it's

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
gonna be tricky

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
to get right in a couple of scenarios

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
but i do think that we're going to see

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,600
more and more of that

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
yeah makes makes a lot of sense and i

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,360
think we definitely

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,559
agree that um or that we are in the in

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,559
the joint endeavor

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,240
of moving kind of software development

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
knowledge in the cloud i will i would

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
like to add

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,919
one because i am super um i'm super big

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
and bullish on edge and serverless i

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,799
think that serverless has a lot of

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,799
potential for us to go do stuff

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,159
i think serverless is one of the most

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,919
frustrating things in our industry

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,360
because the developer experience is so

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,280
cool so i don't know if it's going to

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,880
happen but i wanted to

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
i want serverless to get a better

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,720
developer experience um

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,080
somewhere some way somehow because i

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,400
think there's a whole lot of untapped

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
potential for us in that

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
great yeah i think we have we have

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,480
anurag from render also speaking

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,559

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,840
