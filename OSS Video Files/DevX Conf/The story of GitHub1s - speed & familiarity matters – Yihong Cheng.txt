Title: The story of GitHub1s - speed & familiarity matters â€“ Yihong Cheng
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Almost everyone knows VS Code and probably has tried it. With GitHub1s, you can use VS Code as a web app to browse open source codes without cloning the repo. And even switch to a PR or a tag to see the changed files side by side. We will share how GitHub1s achieves this and what open source community means to us.

hey everyone

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,400
this is ihong chen today we will talk

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
about the story of github ones

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
the speed and the family aerative

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,199
matters

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,599
there are three major contributors for

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
this project and all of us will join the

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
discord

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
channel and we will share the link of

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,480
the slide

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,840
first of all what is github wise

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,200
github once is one website the url is

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,440
githubwise.com the purpose of the

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,800
project is one second to read

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,440
github code with westcode the project

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,039
gains

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,079
more than 17000 stars on github

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,719
in less than two months you can read

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
more about

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
it on this link

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,680
when you hit the githubwise.com

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,479
you will see very similar ui

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
like your local west code editors like

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
this

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
its support not only will the code

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
online

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,720
but it can explore and switch branch

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,360
tags

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,799
commit and will single file history

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840
and west coast extension support we have

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
packed

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
a lot of built-in west coast utility

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,640
together

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,600
for this web version and of course we

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,200
have bundled other extensions like dark

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,040
jupiter scala and cuddling

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,040
talk is cheap let's take a look

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,840
let me move my video to right hand side

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,719
okay you can see it immediately open

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,479
our official repo here

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,000
then open the redmi file

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:15,360
you can do some file search like

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,360
let's say what's the sponsors

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
you can immediately jump here it also

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,879
supports the file

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,120
search based on the campaign for example

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
you will want to find git file

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,000
this is largest source graph api

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,640
that searches the entire repo not only

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,319
this file but the entire label you can

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,440
find something readme something in the

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,440
sponsors and github.ts

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,480
uh i mentioned it supports the file

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,319
history

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,519
file history can be found on the

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,239
let me zoom in a little bit

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
so you can see it clearly there are two

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,720
icons if i click

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,760
the left arrow it means go back by one

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,760
commit

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,840
you can say last commit someone changed

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,280
those lines you can go back another

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,400
commit etc

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,080
we mentioned its support switch

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,080
branch and commit if you click this icon

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,200
inside this source code related

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,799
you can see there is pull request list

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,920
you can expand that let's commit

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,680
it also have the ui like if you click

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,120
this header it can go jump to different

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
tags

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,440
go to different branches

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,519
it also supports the cli like

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:59,120
github os i can search a commit

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,200
you can search fix and i hit

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
enter it will jump to the comment

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
also support search for requests let's

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,200
take a pull request as

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,519
an example i remember

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:20,320
it's previewed os

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,320
so you can see we directly jump to the

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,800
uh website the poll requests wheel

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,080
if i go here it also has the

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
file changes

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919
also it kept the commit history based on

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
the current

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
pull request header

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,040
you eat pan they also have similar wheel

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,120
and you can jump by click as well

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,400
i mentioned it supports extensions

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,960
let's try that

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,880
the wim extension is uh really popular

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,759
right now 2.4 media

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,960
and they support the weber version i

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
just

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,039
install that and go

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
to whatever file

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,880
interest okay you can see the cursor

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:22,160
cursor is already changed to

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,160
the shape and it supports search

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,840
and also here

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,160
you can see the match and you can see we

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,800
change it to

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:41,440
insert mode go back to normal mode

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,919
yeah that's pretty much we want demo

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,919
today

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
next we want to talk about how to

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,720
rebuild github wise

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,520
github wise is a static web application

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
the only intake the only interaction

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,400
with

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,199
our backend is retrieve the javascript

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,039
file

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,720
html file etc

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,639
the project leverages the code server

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,880
which is an open source project port

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:20,400
the west coast to web version

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
and we build the customer intention to

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
support

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,680
all the integration uh all the

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,639
interaction with github

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
to for example to choose the file

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,880
content

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,600
and integrate with graphql uh not

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,080
graphql

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,280
source graph to get the

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,160
file search and you can find

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,880
more detail about the architecture of

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,240
this link

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,880
next we want to talk about the

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,560
development happiness

00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,479
uh i believe that's why this

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,400
project is so popular and so active for

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,280
other contributors

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,080
we have a very good ci make every

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,319
contribute

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,360
confident because all their

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,880
ip all their change regardless is big

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,240
one or small one

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,440
it will get test on the

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
ci environment and we leverage the worst

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
cell

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
intro all kind of changes are available

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,800
before

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,479
you before anyone actually reviews the

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,080
pull request and we did our best to make

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,160
sure

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,440
it's fast and convenient to develop

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,000
the project let's

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
take some demo for this probably i don't

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
need to open a new one

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,160
but if i just open this one

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,280
first of all let's open that in the git

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,879
pod

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
this will load the actual development

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,960
environment

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,639
in your browser you can see it might

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,280
take a while in meanwhile

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:10,840
we can take a look of the ci setup

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:16,000
github wise probably just open this one

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,800
and let's go back

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
go back here

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,400
let's take local file of our

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,039
pull request for example this one

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,640
upgrade west coast to 1.55.0

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,599
let's open it in github.com

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,959
you can see there is checks let me just

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,720
zoom out

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,680
there's all kind of uh

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
ci test like build test with full west

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,000
coast build

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:57,200
and build test let's append that

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,560
or say i actually try to

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,560
clone the code set up the environment

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,200
and try to build and load

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,640
the build output to have less

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
broader and try to make sure the

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,080
critical function

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,519
still works as effective

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,320
they also have the code scan result it's

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,519
static code analysis to make sure your

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
code is still good

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
let's go back to the

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,640
git part okay open the ide

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,640
and you can say there's two terminal

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,839
let me just zoom in

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,320
too much i see here it's already

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,480
installed all the dependency

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,320
and i should run there and watch

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:05,839
on the next session i need

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,839
long games so

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
it will immediately open another tab

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,800
that preview our change i better click

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,560
ok to dismiss the binder i already knew

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,200
that

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,000
okay let's make a code changer to see

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
how it works

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,720
probably max is

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:39,200
lower and let's try to add the

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,200
sponsors as

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:48,320
here now i need

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,320
add nam let's add github

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:56,800
i don't know whether p to be uppercase

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,680
or not and link

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,680
should be yes

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,920
dial description

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,839
reading please

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,360
let's sell this

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:29,839
and you can see it try to rebuild

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
now we can go to the next tab

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
refresh let's see whether it appears

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,959
here

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,360
oh cool there you go we have

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,120
brazil soft graph and git pod heavy

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,320
coding with git power

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,120
that's how we let's hope not a way but

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
if anyone wants developers this project

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,880
with

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,079
github you can do this way

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,440
also i mentioned we mac

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,880
it's really fast to develop let's

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
show some data here

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,160
i mentioned we have the worst cell to

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,600
deploy that let's take a look how

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,120
how fast it could be let's say it's only

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,200
three minutes to deploy that

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,760
and if you check the history

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
you can see it's almost two or three

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
minutes

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,800
multiplying ourselves

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
and they will go back to probably 10

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,440
days ago

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,040
attack more than 10 30 means my video

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,079
usually is more than

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:50,399
13 sometimes 16 the same story apply

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,600
for the github actions as well

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
that's because we use the pre-built west

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,480
coast

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,160
let's speed up the process

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,680
a lot like you can say that four three

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,959
minutes here if we go back

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,839
17 18 minutes

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,839
nine days ago

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,079
yeah uh let's talk about the

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,360
collaborations for this project because

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,839
of course we collaborate

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,399
with github we just show you and we show

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,120
you

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,920
the worst cell and source graph in the

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
previous

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,760
demo we already showed that you can

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,240
search the file

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,399
and we will have feature collaboration

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,680
with source graph as well

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,680
and another one really make

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
my life and probably all the major

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
contributors

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,199
left you there is there's tons of other

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,959
contributors

00:13:51,199 --> 00:14:03,839
that write further intentions for us

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:03,839
let's see here

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,639
yeah here you can see all the

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,920
third-party related projects

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,440
chrome extensions firefox extension

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,160
microsoft edit extensions i promise you

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,240
that

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,240
all of those extensions are from other

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,240
contributors not

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
the major contributing methods

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,560
and a lot of other computers probably

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,079
not

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,360
focus on the technical but

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,880
they try to improve our

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,240
like documentation like we record the

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,160
really nice gif file

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,560
that like show how the project works

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,560
um we really appreciate those app

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,160
and as i mentioned there's other

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,120
active contributors confused to this

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
project

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
right now there are three major

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,000
contributors netcam

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,199
sithan and me and

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,480
also there's other

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,320
20 small contributors

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,360
let's just double check i'm i'm not sure

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,600
the screenshot is the most updated

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,639
one yeah uh

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
let's talk about our root map i think we

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,279
already have a

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,320
usable product but there's

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,680
there are more requests comes almost

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,120
every day

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,440
this is just a summary of

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,360
we commit to do and there there are

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,320
more requests in the our usual page

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,720
we definitely will support github gis

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,440
and

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
will support other platform like gitlab

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
bitbucket

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,600
support modify code and create a pll

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
commit online

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,399
uh why not try to create a clone of

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
github

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:14,560
we will only support the very minimal

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:18,880
edit we we probably will never

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,320
try to execute the code online

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,440
or attach to docker

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
and another two major one i want to talk

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,040
about

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,240
is local west code extension we want

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,880
publish the extension

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
not only for the web version but for

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,279
your local west coast

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,240
editor so that you can have similar

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,800
appearance because

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:48,000
i find there's a lot of handy features

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,199
like just will some

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,639
github ripple with that clone that is

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,120
really convenient for me and

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,880
sometimes i have my best code editor

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,519
open i probably kept it open

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:06,480
all day so why not just load it locally

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,039
but of course the code is still on

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,319
github.com

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,880
and another famous one is jump

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,360
jump to definition of symbols the symbol

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,400
means probably a wearable

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,600
or function so like

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,720
whenever you explore new codes

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,200
like i don't know like where

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
the code the function is defined the

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,600
variable is defined

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,600
if i can directly jump to the

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,720
functioning implementation that would be

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,480
great

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,160
and you can read more on the our

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
wiki page

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,120
okay uh now is the qa time

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,559
oh as i mentioned before all the major

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,000
contributors will

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,120
join the discord channel and

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
um and we're happy to answer all kind of

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:08,480
questions
