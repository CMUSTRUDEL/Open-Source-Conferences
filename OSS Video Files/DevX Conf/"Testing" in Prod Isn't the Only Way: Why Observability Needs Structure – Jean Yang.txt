Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	The rise of APIs and service-oriented architectures has made it easier than ever before to build complex web applications. But the developer tools we use were made for a simpler time, one where developers had more control over all of the software they ran. Today, web applications contain many heterogeneous components, all talking to each other across the network, many of them SaaS apps. "Testing" in production has become the only way to make sense. I'll talk about why we need to update our idea of testing, how we can do better at understanding prod, and how bringing structure to observability is the way forward for both.
