Title: How to build a dApp â€“ Nader Dabit
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: DevX Conf
Description: 
	Decentralized apps (dApps) are continuing to gain momentum in the industry. Blockchain developers are also now some of the highest paid in the entire industry. Building decentralized apps is a paradigm shift that requires a different way of thinking than apps built with traditional centralized infrastructure, tooling, and services.

As a React developer, I had a hard time understanding this entirely new (to me) ecosystem, how everything fit together, and the mental model needed to understand and be a productive full stack developer in this space.

In this talk, I'll give a comprehensive overview of the space, how you can get started building these types of applications, and the entire tech stack broken apart then put back together to show how everything works.
