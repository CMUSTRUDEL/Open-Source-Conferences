Description: 
	In order to innovate and deliver new products that your users will love you often have to design & build very complex features. You may even be the first doing that in that particular way, so you will often struggle to find experts on the topic to help you. With incremental delivery you can empower your team to become the expert and still have a shorter time to market by delivering value to customers one mini feature at a time. At Snyk, my team has used incremental delivery to deliver countless technically complex features – this is definitely one for your toolbox.
