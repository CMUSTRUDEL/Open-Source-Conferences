Abstract: Advertising auction, product pricing optimization, anomaly detection, network optimization and application monitoring all require an infrastructure that provides a low latency access to data so critical decisions can be made in a very short amount of time. Apache Druid is used as the backend for these use cases to empower users to analyze their data in realtime.  Rommel will be talking about the architecture, deployment model of Druid and how to tune it for performance.
