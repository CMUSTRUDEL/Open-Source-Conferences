Abstract: I will reveal the lessons I learned while discovering how to test React components using Jest and Enzyme, an open source testing framework built specifically for use with React. This talk will be centered around my personal experience of building one of the applications for the Red Hat Marketplace, an open cloud marketplace. I will reveal tips on how to enhance your applications by ensuring it's bug free using the best features of Enzyme. In contrast, I will also expose the pitfalls of using Enzyme and the best ways to overcome them. Attendees will learn how to install and run Enzyme as well as how to debug their applications.
