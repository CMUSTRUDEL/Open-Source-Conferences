Abstract: Godot is a completely free, open source game engine with features to rival the proprietary titans of the game development world. Godot is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy, and is a mature, powerful product. But not enough people know about it. Let’s fix that? In this session, we’ll show you how amazing Godot is by building a 3D game in 45 minutes… live, in front of you.

You’ll get a hands-on, rapid-fire introduction to using Godot’s IDE and its programming language, GodotScript, as well as a look at Godot’s visual, block-based programming environment as you learn how to build games that run on almost any platform in a powerful, entirely open source environment.

Topics include:

- How to install and set up Godot
- How to import assets, like sound and art, into Godot
- How to set up your scene in the Godot editor and create nodes and scene objects
- How to create input actions to receive input from keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, and the like
- How to add scripts to objects
- How to export and build your game

By the time you’re through, you’ll have no excuse but to go forth and build games (using open source technology!) Godot runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You have absolutely no excuses not to make games. Fun, right?

	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,080
hi

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,519
hi welcome to live coding again in 45

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
minutes with open source

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,559
tech next slide uh so hello i'm tim

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
from paris you can tweet us at the the

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,640
handles on the screen we love to talk to

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,880
you

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,560
and we should be responding live because

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,279
this is the future we're mostly friendly

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,119
so uh we're here to talk about games uh

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,720
so we work on games this is a game we've

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,760
worked on actually we didn't do a huge

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,000
amount on that one but we did help a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
little

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
bit uh we also write a lot of books

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,120
write a lot of books around all sorts of

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
different things uh we've got a bit of a

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,480
bent towards mobile development and

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
gaming games

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
so today we're going to be talking about

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
gotto the uh

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
open source game engine now the most

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,719
important bit is this next bit right

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
here how do you pronounce

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,000
godo now we're going to be pronouncing

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
it gotto like dot

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
gotto not gotto like godot

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
you can pronounce it however you want no

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,600
one's going to mind we're pronouncing it

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
this way because this is how patrick

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
stewart pronounced it

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
we're not actually sure which one's the

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,399
official pronunciation but we're

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,680
australians and we're founders of

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,640
patrick stewart and mckellen so we're

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,840
going to go with godo

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
gotto you pronounce it however you want

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,360
all right so that's the hybrid of the

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,439
way all right so godo is a

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
fully open source game engine game

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
development tool whatever sort of term

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,759
you want to use

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
it's uh part of the software freedom

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,159
freedom conservancy group uh it's

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
one of those sort of projects and now

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,960
what we're going to do is paris is going

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560
to jump into godot

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,159
and i'm going to talk a little bit about

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
game engines just as an abstract sort of

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,119
concept so if you're not

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,920
used to game development uh and

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
depending on your background you've

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
probably never done it

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,920
the old school way of doing games was

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
you would basically just sit down and

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
start coding up the game you do

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,759
everything in code

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
other than obviously artwork and audio

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,720
and that sort of stuff but it would all

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
be built entirely

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
uh done in code effectively you'll be

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
building out the whole

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
sort of tool set yourself that sort of

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
changed uh when this concept of

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
engines came about which was basically

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,479
taking reusable bits of the code

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
and then uh being able to reuse them

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,759
over time the engines got more and more

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,399
flexible and they sort of became their

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
own

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
almost spin-off projects to the games

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,920
themselves gotto is one of them

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,520
we're going to jump into god and we'll

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
talk about how to build actual video

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,759
game

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,879
so tim's going to kind of narrate what

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,080
i'm doing i'm using a computer so

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,280
apologies are not looking directly at

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
you at all times there is a computer

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
below

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
uh trust us on that so i've fired up

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
goto here got it looks like this you can

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
see its icon down in my dock

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
gotta runs on linux macos windows and

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,239
probably anything else you could name

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
because it's actually written in godot

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
so uh that's a very common thing you'll

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
you'll see a lot in game engines both

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,720
the open source and the proprietary ones

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,200
they're generally written in their own

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
libraries um so which has some advantage

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
and some of this oh i find i've got it

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
here and i'm going to click the new

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
project button and we're going to make a

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
project live in front of you in the next

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,879
you know 40 minutes or so

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
hopefully so we'll click the new project

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
button we're going to call our new

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
project

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
paris and tim's game i love that game

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
then we're going to put it on my desktop

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,239
because it's where all projects should

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,400
go

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,440
all work should go on your desktop at

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
all times that's

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
professional development so i'm going to

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
click the create an edit button and god

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,440
is going to create a new project for us

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
and then relaunch itself because that's

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
what it does

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,480
now this is uh depending again on your

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,159
background and sort of game development

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
pretty much every game development tool

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,840
now sort of starts with this sort of

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
like empty void with a grid on it

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
um it's like tron have you ever seen

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
tron this is the grid

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,000
the digital frontier is that what the

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
line is currently something like that we

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,879
don't have bruce box

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,440
we do not oh that would be great if we

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,440
did though oh it will be um

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
we can't afford it here we go um so

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
they're now actually built up in these

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
sort of uh

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,040
virtual 3d environments you build the

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,519
world you want to create you then drag

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
in the

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,480
you know gameplay elements themselves

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
you'll have to actually code them which

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
paris will do in a moment

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
but you've got sort of this like this

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,760
open world that you can do things in you

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
no longer start with like code you start

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,080
with

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
the world and you add the code into it

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
so we're going to make a quick little 3d

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,239
gaming godo for you today so i've got

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,599
this empty scene here it's completely

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,879
empty it's not even saved you can see it

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
says empty right here

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
and i'm going to add a thing to our

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
scene so this inspector here shows us

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,080
our seating gutter

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,319
scene is what's comprised in a specific

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
view godot is made up of scenes you

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,000
compose your game of scenes scenes have

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
nodes in them so this scene currently

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
has nothing in it so i'm going to add a

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,680
node

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
right to our unnamed c so i'm going to

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,239
click the little plus button here

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
and it will come up with this box which

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,040
lets me pick a type of node i'm going to

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
pick a spatial node

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
so if i click spatial it'll tell me what

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
it is uh so goto actually has a whole

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
bunch of sort of out-of-the-box

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,440
convenience

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,280
nodes which do all sorts of things a

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
spatial node is just one that basically

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
exists in so we now have a spatial node

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,160
in this scene our spatial node doesn't

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
have much more than a

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
transform which is a position in 3d

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,919
space you can see it there it's got no

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
visual elements though

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,720
uh it's it's got an x a y a z

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,280
a a z sorry an x y and a z uh z

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
and it'll have a rotation and a scale

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
anyway it's you know anything i've seen

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
now we've got it here it's right here

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
the

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
expansion is the parent of all 3d things

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
in in godot

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
so i'm going to click the plus again

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
while i have this spatial modifier

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,600
selected and add another node that node

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,080
is going to be a mesh instance

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
so a mesh instance is another it's like

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
a subclass basically

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
this allows you to have meshes which is

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,120
the

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
game term for models one helpful thing

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
about godo's

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
node adding ui is it actually shows you

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,800
the framework uh the relationship

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
between things so if you see note as the

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,080
top of all things below that is spatial

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
and then we can go down we can find our

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,800
mesh but if i just filter so if i type

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,160
mesh

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,240
you'll see that mesh instance descends

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
from node and so on so we've got a bunch

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
of other things

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,479
yeah a mesh is basically just something

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,400
that will hold a 3d model

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
you know so i have a mesh instance as a

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
child to my spatial node

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,880
i'm going to add a cube to the scene so

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
over here in the inspector for the

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
currently selected node which is mesh

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
instance over on the right side of the

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,039
screen

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
in the top right i'm going to add a mesh

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
godot comes with a bunch of primitive

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
meshes we want a cube

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,199
i'm going to click that cube you can

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
also import

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
you know 3d meshes made in blender or

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
that's for speed reasons today we're

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
going to try and do everything within

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the engine

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
because you know otherwise just be

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
boring jumping back to blender going

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,000
saving the file dumping

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
so i've added this lovely i've added

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
this lovely cube mesh and i'm going to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,199
go oh

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
it's amazing it's such a great it's

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,840
amazing i'm going to have it over here

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,440
material and i'm going to add

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
a new spatial material a spatial

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,759
material is just a thing that can give

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
something a color

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,919
tim's going to tell me what color to

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,039
make this though because i am very

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
colorblind so we're going to say that's

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,039
albedo

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,560
to a specific color oh let's go

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,919
let's sort of go with an orangey wheel

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
so you got something right there yeah

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,120
yeah looks like this

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
yeah we'll go with that this is more

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
yellow this is gonna be our floor so our

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,840
floor is gonna be orange

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,960
okay so i'm very colorblind so tim is

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,319
going to pick the colors for me this is

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,840
that's our professional relationship tim

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
picks the colors and i make the cubes

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840
so we have this nice orange cube here uh

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
which is uh descending from our spatial

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,240
mesh

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
uh it's really really good so now i'm

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
going to select the mesh instance over

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,440
here in the scene

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
inspector and i'm going to click the

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,039
little mesh button up here

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,240
okay so this button will allow me to

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
create a

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,400
tri-mesh static body this is a thing

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
that will allow

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
collisions to occur so currently this

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
cube does not exist in any sort of

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,400
physical sense it's just a picture of a

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
cube

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,919
but by giving it a try mesh static body

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,759
we're going to say this thing

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
has a body it exists within the physics

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,599
engine that godot ships with

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
this is a an interesting sort of side

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,759
effect i guess or quirk of

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,599
of modern meshes being really high

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,199
resolution so in very very early games

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
very early 3d games

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
you could actually just use the mesh

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
itself as the collider

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
but now in modern games and they got

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,759
like you know gazillion little triangles

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
if you use the

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
mesh as the collision system it would

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,360
just be too slow so instead you add

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,039
sort of an additional collision uh

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
object around it to help down it you

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
don't have to do that because we're

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
doing with cubes

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,400
we can probably get away with it but

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
gotto is sort of working on the

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
assumption you're making one of these

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,000
you know nice

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
lovely pretty things so you you need to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
add a collage you'll see over here that

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,919
our static body and collision shape have

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
been added

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
a static body just means it's not going

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,840
to move so a static body is something

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
that exists in the physics engine can be

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,240
collided with but is unlikely

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,919
or strongly discouraged from moving it's

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,520
a literal unstoppable

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,199
immovable object not unstoppable we'll

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
get back to things that can move later

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,120
on

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,280
hopefully so i'm going to select the

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
mesh instance again

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,800
i'm going to push the r button which

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
switches to the scaling tool you'll see

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
when i push the r button the scaling

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,639
tool became active up here

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
so you can see all the different tools

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,560
we can pick but the r button is the

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
sculling tool

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,840
and now i'm going to squish this cube a

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,039
little bit to make it into a floor okay

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,720
so all this is doing is just changing

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,680
its parameters

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
actually i'm finding that's not very

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,160
precise so instead of squishing it i'm

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
going to go over here

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
in the right side and use the transform

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
uh inspector to change its scale to

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
something so i'm going to say it's about

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
on the x nice and long it's about 0.5

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
high

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
and you know maybe 10 on the other one

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,520
so it's a nice big flat floor

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,440
so uh what paris is doing over in the

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,479
inspector there is he's modifying the

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,959
transform values

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
this is sort of a an approach taken by i

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,719
believe every game development tool out

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,560
there now uh both the proprietary and

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
the open source ones in that they they

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
have this sort of like a

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
component flow model is sort of how i've

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,080
seen it described

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,160
basically you you give components and

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,360
attributes to these nodes in this case

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,959
and then they

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
control how it actually works this is

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,240
sort of like this clear separation train

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
here's the thing in space

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,160
and here's the properties it has on it

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
absolutely um it's very very common uh

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
it's not just a godo thing

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
but so i've just renamed that spatial

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,320
node to floor just because it's a floor

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
uh you do that by clicking and pushing

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
enter or you can right click on it and

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,920
go rename

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
and that's everything for our floor but

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
you'll see it's still an unsaved scene

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
so i'm going to push command s on my mac

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,720
and controllers on windows

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,640
and linux and i'm going to save it for

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,519
dot tsen is fine name for that so i'm

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
just going to leave that

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
and click save so now you'll see our

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
floor scene has been saved it is also in

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,399
the file system inspector down here as a

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
file that we can actually move around

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
and do stuff with that's everything for

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,959
the floor

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
so something's kind of uh interesting

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,160
about gotto

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
and it's something that other game

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,360
engines have started taking and i think

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
they've been very inspired by gotto is

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
gotto sort of builds everything up out

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
of these scenes

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
and you're designed to import and nest

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
scenes so

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
like you might have a something else

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
that the floor will have

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
you might have a player and then you'll

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
have sub players and you'll see that in

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,480
a minute

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
you build a lot of these sort of like

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
these nested scene objects and then

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
import them into other scenes and so on

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,360
and so forth

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,640
and at the time that was sort of uh now

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,320
it's very common

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
you'll see it everywhere but godo was i

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
believe the one who really pioneered

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
that

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
uh as as the idea of like go nest mad so

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
i'm going to make a new scene now and

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
then speed things along a little bit so

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,760
we actually see what's going on so i'm

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,200
going to click new scene you'll see a

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
new empty scene my floor still exists up

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
here

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,120
back on the grid in my new scene i am

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
going to do the whole process i did last

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,040
time which is create a nice spatial node

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,880
inside that spatial node i'm going to

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
add a mesh instance it's pretty much

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,360
exactly the same as it did last time

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
inside that mesh instance my mesh this

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
time will again

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
be a cube and tim's going to pick a nice

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
new color for me to set the material to

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,519
when i create the material

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,959
so my color will be should go like a

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
yellow these are the walls you want

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
yellow wall like this

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,079
oh that's more green you don't like

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,000
michael let's drive it up a little bit

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,839
that's too green yeah that'll do one

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
thing yeah

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
static body because the walls don't need

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,120
to move and then i'm going to scale the

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,560
wall so i'm going to do the transform

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,440
over here and i'm going to say maybe the

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,360
wall should be

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,519
0.25 or 1

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,800
and ten so it's a nice long wall well

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
it's miraculous you're just picking the

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,880
exact

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,880
right numbers it is amazing yes

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,959
totally didn't totally prepare this yes

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
i'm going to rename spatial mode over

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,880
here

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,920
to walls the walls and i'm going to save

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
the sea

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
walls that's great now we have two

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,640
elements that's that's actually amazing

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,760
so that's our two scenes so far wall and

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,800
floors and they're both saved in the

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,959
file system

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
so i'm going to create another new scene

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,560
now and in this scene

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,320
i am going to add a spatial node

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,640
surprising absolutely nobody

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
i mean you surprised me sure yeah i'm

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,440
going to rename that spatial load now to

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
environment because this is the

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
this is the scene that's going to hold

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
our level this is going to be the world

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
that our player exists in and has their

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
adventures in

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
and then i'm going to select that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
spatial mode that i just created and

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
click this link icon instead of the plus

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,440
icons the plus icon lets me add

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,920
new fresh nose to this scene the link

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
icon lets me bring in existing scenes

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,200
then click this link icon and you'll see

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,079
it knows that there's two saved scenes

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
in my project

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,959
right so i'm going to add the floor bam

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
this is linked to that other scene so if

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,920
i went and edited this floor it would

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
take effect in this scene now because

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,360
it's just bringing

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
an instance of that floor in for me i'm

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
also going to

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
add the wall so i'm going to select

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
environment again before i add the walls

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,800
because i want the wall to be a child of

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
the environment not a child of the floor

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,399
i'm going to add a wall okay that's

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
that's amazing

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
i love it i love it i'm going to move

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,120
that wall around using this tool here

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,320
the move mode so i'm going to push w on

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
my keyboard and you'll see these arrows

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
change into arrows and i can move it

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
around

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
now that moving around isn't quite as

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
you know snappy as i want it to be so

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,959
i'm going to click this button up here

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,200
which is enabling snap mode and we'll

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
make it snap as i move it

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,160
you can also configure the the snap grid

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
if you want we're just going to use the

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,240
default

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
i'm going to click top view so i can see

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,959
where i am so this thing up here lets me

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,920
move different views top view means i

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
can just position things a bit more

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,399
effectively

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,360
so i've got a nice thing there i'm going

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
to click while i've got this wall

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
selected i'm going to push

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,880
command d on my mac controller in

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
windows and duplicate it and i'll have

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,279
another one exactly the same position

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,120
i'm going to move the other side because

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,079
i want to have walls on both sides

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,839
now if you're not sort of used to uh

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,440
moving around in 3d space

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,279
this might be a little bit like hang on

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,480
what's going on um but this is

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,800
definitely the way you do it in games

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
now

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,079
you're going to be spending a lot of

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,160
time moving things around in 3d space

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
because it does actually work out fast

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
so i've duplicated the wall three times

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,519
here i've got another one in the middle

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
this one i need to rotate to go up on

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,839
the sides

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,760
so with this wall selected i'm going to

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,560
go into its transform inspector over

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
here

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
and i'm going to rotate it 90 degrees

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,760
minus 90 degrees on the y

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
so it's flipped the other way i'm going

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
to put it up here

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,760
then i'm going to duplicate it again and

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,360
put it down here

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,800
look at that isn't that amazing i love

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,399
it i could fiddle with the snapping but

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,519
i'm lazy so i won't but you can go and

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,480
click here in the transform and

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,000
configure the snap

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
so you can make it you know more precise

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
so i could um actually do it because i'm

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
not as lazy as i thought it was but you

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,199
know i can uh

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
you know click this thing and then i can

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,079
move it around so you know it's

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
different different snap different snap

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,519
distance but you know we don't need to

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
look pretty good how it was i'm going to

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
save that as

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
environment so now we have this nice

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,880
saved scene

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,040
beautiful look at that oh it's stunning

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
can

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
so there's a couple of things a couple

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,120
of things wrong here i need to move

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,160
these wall up a little bit so i'm just

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
going to grab them and slide them up a

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,240
little bit

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
because they're not quite in the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,639
position that i want them to be so i'm

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,000
going to grab that one and then i'm

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
going to grab that one and move it up a

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
little bit

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
and i'm going to grab that one and move

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,560
it up a little bit and i'm gonna grab

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,000
that one and move it up a little bit so

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,600
now they're all kind of

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,800
more wall-ish love it beautiful okay so

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
i'm gonna push command just to make sure

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
that's saved

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,040
that's amazing so have this beautiful

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
floor it's great

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
we're done everyone's we're done that's

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,199
the entire no it's not okay so what i'm

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,959
going to do is i'm going to rename this

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,000
floor to lower floor

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,720
because we're going to be adding an

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,639
upper floor i can't put spaces in i'm

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,959
just an old-school unix beard at heart

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,959
and

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,240
you know i don't believe in spaces i'm

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
going to link another instance i'll

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
trust them

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,959
the environment scene ah no no sorry

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,000
that was a mistake

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,480
i'm going to link another instance of

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the floor scene you can't nest yourself

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
can't notice yourself yes because sorry

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,519
i

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
think so now i have two floors on top of

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
each other i'm going to move this one up

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
and move it away

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
and put it over here somewhere for now

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
that's pretty good it's pretty good oh

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,959
yeah it looks that's fine

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,160
i'm going to rename that to upper floor

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
i'm not going to put any walls

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,240
on that one because i like to live

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,160
dangerously yeah yeah uh

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,000
you know guy to building it's the star

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
wars approach to building things

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
uh where you know you don't actually

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
want to make sure there's any safety

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,880
features at all

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
you want you you want your employees to

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
fall clean off clean off into the big

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,279
green beans

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
so now that we have our two floors one

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,320
with walls one with that

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,160
we probably want a way to get from one

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
floor to the other floor so i'm going to

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
make a new scene again

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
it's the first thing they teach you in

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,920
game dev crazy make sure there's a way

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,040
to get from one floor to another it's

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
actually not the first thing to teach

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,320
you

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,399
new spatial node called ramp

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,839
okay so we're just pointing out we

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
didn't have to do these as sort of like

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
uh

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,639
individual scenes it's just sort of it's

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
the the more godo way to do them as

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,560
individual scenes that way you can sort

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
of keep

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,079
uh moving them around as needed making

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
changes in one and not having i was

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,399
getting slightly ahead of myself here

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,839
but what i need to do is i've made a new

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,199
spatial node with a mesh instance and in

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,000
that mesh instance i'm adding another

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,680
cube

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,199
tim's going to pick a color for me again

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
oh i mean we're sticking with the green

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
yellow palette so i guess we're going to

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,880
go with that again

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,040
i don't know what color do you reckon

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,759
let's sort of

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
yeah there yeah yeah there that looks

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
like that that that screams ramp to you

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,199
yeah

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
that's got screens right we've got big

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
ramp in it big grab energy okay we're

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
clicking this mesh instance we're adding

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
our nice static collider again

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,959
and now we're going to scale this mesh

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,320
i'm going to use the inspector to scale

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,839
it again just because i'm lazy

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,079
and with these totally not pre-prepared

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,720
numbers i'm going to go 1.44

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,399
or 0.1 and the very precise 5.47

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,240
that looks like a ramp to me it looks

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,600
fairly rare it almost looks like a

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,880
mini golf swing it does that was the

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,000
idea yeah so i'm going to save that

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
scene as ramp

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,240
now we have that done amazing back in

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,040
the environment mind-blowing so over

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
here i'm going to go back into my

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,639
environment tab

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
and i'm going to link in the ramp so add

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,360
in a ramp again i'm going to click the

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,959
environment root node instead of

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,240
loading we're going to ramp things up

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,959
we're going to ramp things up thank you

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
tim

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,480
okay we're going to link in the ramp

00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
it's very interesting i so hope no one

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
laughed

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,079
if you laughed that yeah if you didn't

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,600
laugh

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,640
yeah that was actually good yeah okay so

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,919
we've got the ramping i've seen now

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,959
that's pretty good uh it's kind of

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,079
facing the wrong way but we'll get to

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,360
that in a minute or i'll just move the

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
floor the other side depending on my

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
mood

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,880
oh we'll see how that goes we control

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,839
the universe we do control the universe

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,039
i'm going to rotate it just to show you

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,720
rotation work so you can see you get

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,799
this nice rotating thing here

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,640
so i can grab one of these probably that

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,679
one right yep

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,439
look at that pretty cool i'm going to

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
move it over here

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,760
and then i'm going to rotate it a bit

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,360
more i'm going to rotate it that way

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,880
so that's kind of you know very steep

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,960
ramp yeah well

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,799
it's a hard world life his life is tough

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
tim life is time life is life is hard

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,080
life is not full of joy

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
games are not at all for a scheme now

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,360
sorry so we've got a ramp it's kind of

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,919
connected to the two platforms together

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,280
ah we're done right that's it now we

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,320
need a player so we actually need a way

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,320
to play this game so i'm going to make

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,679
another new scene

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,200
again i'm breaking things up into scene

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,559
so you can see the componentized

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,760
approach that godot takes

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,600
i could have just made one scene and put

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
all these objects into it but then if i

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
wanted to modify something i would have

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,520
to undo it all the

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,440
the main advantage really becomes when

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
you're building bigger games than just

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
one sort of

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
mini game like this in that you can sort

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
of actually create proper reusable

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
components like you can have the player

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
used ever instead of

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,200
basically making a bespoke lovely player

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,559
for each and every level so the root

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
note of my player scene is actually

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
going to be not static

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,440
because it needs to move so it's going

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,160
to be something called a kinematic body

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,640
kinematic is just a fancy word for moves

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
it

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,240
participates in the physics engine but

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,840
pretty much like all the other scenes

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,200
our camera body is the root note but our

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,760
next thing will be a mesh because you

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
know

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,320
it's a 3d game most things are meshes uh

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
mesh this time is not going to be a cube

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,720
it's actually going to be a capsule

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,840
we're you know mixing it up as this

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
tradition you know the video game

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,720
character for

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,080
prototyping is a capsule tim's going to

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
pick a nice color for our player

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
character here

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
i'm thinking we go down into the blue

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
palette so we're going to spend much

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,640
time there

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
yeah ah that definitely screams player

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,360
to me screens play okay yeah we've got a

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
nice blue

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
thing here but let's rotate it upwards

00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
maybe no we're not going to rotate

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
ourselves yet

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,840
we're going to rotate once later okay

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
i'm going to add a collision shape to

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,640
this to this

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
uh player though so i'm going to go here

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
and go collision

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
shape so we can pick collision polygon

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,600
if it was 2d but shape is 3d so

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
uh so god oh essentially has two engines

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
that work

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
the same they they've got a 2d and a 3d

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
one

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,720
from your perspective how you interface

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
with them they basically work the same

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,919
as just

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,760
you know use the 3d forms of the nodes

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,840
in the 3d one use the 2d ones in

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
the 2d form the reason they're separate

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
at all is just i'm assuming for

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,880
performance i don't

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,840
actually know in time every game engine

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,960
does it that way you'll see our

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
collision shape is currently chucking a

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
little error there for us because it

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
doesn't actually know what it needs to

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
be the shape of

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
click this collision shape and just like

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,760
i did when i added a capsule on a cube

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,799
go over here to its inspector and say

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,919
your shape is actually a capsule

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,679
because i haven't modified the default

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,120
parameters or rotated the capsule it

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,240
knows it's exactly the same position so

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,080
it's good for now

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
so right now we have a player that can

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,960
move because it's kinematic

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
it can collide with things because it

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,080
has a collision shape and it knows its

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,200
shape which is capsule

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
you could conceivably make your

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
collision shape a different shape to the

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
physical

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
visual shape which is something video

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,799
games do commonly because you know you

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,600
don't want the player to squeeze into

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
small spaces

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,760
it's also very very common in most video

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
games even if they have a super accurate

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,799
player mesh

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,320
at least the initial crude physics

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,080
system mesh will just be one of these

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,280
like tic tacs with the the crude sort of

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,440
capsule shape

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,799
um just for doing really quick and dirty

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
checks and then you can do a more

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,200
precise check with the better high

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
quality so i'm going to

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,080
save this scene now it's called player

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
so it's traditional to use capsules for

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,440
your temporary player i've also renamed

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,320
the root note to play so the scene is

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
called player in the root noise called

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,400
player that's it

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,400
okay we're gonna go back into the

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
environment now we're gonna bring in the

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
player so i'm gonna click the

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,919
environment route

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,360
click the link button click the player

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,559
node this should be familiar by now

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,480
and now our little tic tac has appeared

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
okay uh we're going to transform him out

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
of the ground or him it

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,039
whatever i always call these things him

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,320
it's very you know like signifies

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,520
the tech industry as a whole really we

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,720
shouldn't be calling him it's it's a

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
cube it's a

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,720
it's a capsule thing if it does help you

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,360
will start falling in love with your

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
terrible

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
capsule children almost immediately so

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,799
absolutely so you will start naming them

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
i'm going to rotate 90 degrees on the x

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,440
so it comes out of the ground and then

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
i'm going to move it out of the ground

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
manually it doesn't really matter that's

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,720
floating above the ground right now just

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
because we're going to actually add

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,120
gravity to the scene later so the

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,159
capsule is going to float slightly above

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,080
the ground for now

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,280
that's absolutely fine so that's done

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
now i'm going to get another new scene

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,960
after saving that one so c new

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,559
this scene is very simple it's going to

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,840
be

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
a rigid body

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
okay this is slightly different than the

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
other ones because it

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
needs to move around the scene in a

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,159
different way we'll explain that as we

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
get to it i'm going to add a mesh

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,000
instance

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,280
i'm going to add a bowl

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
tim's going to pick me a color for this

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
bowl i mean balls should be red balls

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,360
should be rocco yeah

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,280
definitely red yep

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,240
ah love it love it okay we're going to

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
add a collision shape because we want

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,600
this to be able to collide

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,480
you can actually add proper textures to

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,159
your models

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,679
you don't have to use just solid colors

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,799
it's just you know for time consuming so

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
we've added a collision shape in the

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,200
shape of a sphere as well so this ball

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,799
is a rigid body which means it can move

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,799
around in the physics system

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,840
uh using impulses it has a mesh instance

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,120
showing it's a bowl

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,720
has a red texture on it and it has a

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,240
collision shape which is also a sphere

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
i'm going to save that as ball

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
i love it i'm going to rename the route

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,679
to ball as well save it we're done

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
okay that's everything we needed to do

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,280
here back in the environment get back in

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,640
you know where this is going i'm going

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,240
to click the environment and link the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,520
ball

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
ah amazing i'm going to move this ball

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,080
up to the upper platform

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,919
uh the reason it's always sort of

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,400
starting in the ground is because

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,280
the center of these objects when put at

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
0 0

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,120
zero is only half their height so

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,600
they're sort of

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,640
halfway through the ground um yeah

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
trying to show you where i'm moving it

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
to

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
without confusing myself so it's going

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
to go over there

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,280
and then i'm going to go top view and

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,880
we're going to put it on here somewhere

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
paris is using a trackpad these tools

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
are much easier with a mouse

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,880
yeah so it's fighting above it as before

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,080
it doesn't really matter that's floating

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,360
because gravity will come into effect at

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,320
some point

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,280
but right now it's gonna sit there i'm

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,559
gonna make a goal now because we're

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
gonna make a little game where this

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,120
little player tic-tac has to push this

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
ball into a goal

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,400
that's what we're gonna do marvellous

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,400
marvelous new scene once again

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,840
very simple i'm making another spatial

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
root node so spatial

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,640
no that's not that's an audio stream

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,520
player i'm going to delete that

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,799
and add a spatial node instead we could

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,159
have an audio string yeah i'm going to

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,880
rename my spatial node to goal

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,360
just because in advance it's very useful

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,480
uh

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,760
mesh instance once again i think some

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,200
goals in america

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,120
i don't know i actually don't know i

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,760
have no idea okay i'm going to add a

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
cube

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,320
what color's a goal tim that's a good

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,320
question what color is a goal

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,880
let's have a look at our colors here

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,000
let's go like a cyan

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,640
what kind of sign tim yeah there

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
there yep nice and bright yep yep good

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
enough yeah

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
cool awful but yeah okay so i'm gonna

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,919
make a little bit of a collision body

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,760
again this is static again because it

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,679
never needs to move so we've got that

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,600
so we've got goal one i'm going to

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,559
duplicate that

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,679
actually i'm not going to look at that

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,360
yet i'm going to scale it a little bit

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,919
with my squishy thing here so i'm going

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,720
to

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,080
smoosh it smoosh it a little bit yeah

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,640
that seems fine

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
that seems fine gonna make it nice and

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
tall

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,200
yeah it doesn't really matter that's

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,799
good i'm gonna duplicate that

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,720
move it move it over here so we're

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,520
making you know a bunch of goals

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,400
basically just like

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,039
gold as it were uh that's probably good

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
enough

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,760
yeah i think so that looks like a goal i

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,400
mean i could see someone kicking a

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,480
football i'll save that as goal

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,840
done i love it so once i go again i go

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,240
back to the environment

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,120
i'm going to import my goal so i'm going

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,400
to click environment

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,400
click the link button bring in the goal

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
amazing we're going to move the goal

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,039
into where it's meant to be so that's

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,880
probably over here somewhere because

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,799
it's up on the big platform

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,840
that's where i want it to be back a

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
little bit more yeah back a little bit

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
more you can never figure out how to

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,200
move with the tracks

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,279
okay so the goals are over there that's

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,240
pretty good i think i mean

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,919
fabulous fabulous that's amazing so

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,200
right now i'm now going to make a

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,559
another little thing because it's a

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
video game video games new pickups i

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,640
probably won't get time to actually make

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
the pickup do anything but

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
traditional video games have a little

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,799
pickup that you can you know run over to

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
make it have something happen

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,720
go make another new scene very simple in

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,679
this scene i'm going to

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,440
add an area so an area is something that

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,400
exists to be collided with or trigger

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
something

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
okay so it's something that is just a

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
general purpose thing that exists in 3d

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,640
space and has some sort of volume

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,159
like not sound volume like a volume you

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,080
can exist inside

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
facial volume yeah a spatial volume it

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,640
doesn't have a thing inside in this case

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
it will have a thing inside because we

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
want to see a cube

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,400
but the point of the area is to be a

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
thing that exists for people to collide

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,919
with so i'm going to add another mesh

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,039
instance

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,159
add a cube what color is a pick up tim

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,080
what color is like the

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,240
the gold that you already use red didn't

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,600
we uh

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,360
let's have a look let's go do we have a

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,200
dark purple i don't think we do

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,559
no yeah there yeah let's go with that

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,919
okay this is the color of our uh

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,400
that looks like a shield pick up you

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
know i'm going to add a collision shape

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,000
to this

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,159
once again because it's something that

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,679
exists in the world

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
needs to be collided with it's gonna

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,039
also be cube shaped

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,480
uh where is cube box there we go okay

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,000
box not q yeah not cube

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,320
okay all right yeah so i'm sorry i need

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,480
to make that the uh

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,320
child of that all right yeah sorry

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
okay so we have our area ready to go i'm

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,360
gonna rename that to pick up

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
just because that's what it is and save

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,720
it as pickup now i'm gonna go back into

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,799
the environment

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,279
and add it to the uh the scene the scene

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,720
i'm going to click environment link go

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,880
pick up add it in

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
i'm going to move it over here and then

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,080
pull it out of the ground a little bit

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,679
yeah and put it in the corner you don't

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,200
be able to find it immediately yeah

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,240
this is the goal of our game is to push

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
the ball through the goal and to collect

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,799
the pickup it's a very complicated video

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,640
game yeah

00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,919
it's going to sell sell millions

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,440
millions and millions

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
so back in the environment here uh we're

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,919
going to add some codes we haven't coded

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,840
anything yet you'll see

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
i can run this guy we'll fire it up and

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,000
then do absolutely nothing because hey

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,279
we don't have any code and we don't have

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,240
a camera to show you the scene

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,000
so we're going to add those two things

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
now it is actually running though right

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
now

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
paris and tim's game right there i love

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,440
it oh it's beautiful

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
let me go back into godot and add a

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,000
script so

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,240
i'm going to click my player which is

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
here this thing yep gonna right click on

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,880
it

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,880
and go attach script amazing and it's

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
gonna say what sort of script you want

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
supports a bunch of different things

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,399
it'll support c sharp depending on the

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
build you get we're gonna use gd script

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,720
which has got a built-in scripting

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,799
system there's also a visual scripting

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,760
system with nodes and also other things

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,880
we're going to use gd script it's very

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,080
similar to python

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,320
it's sort of yeah python ish i guess

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,360
inspired by python 5. it's going to ask

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,120
us what we'd like to call what we're

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
going to leave this player.gd gd is judy

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,880
script

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,720
i'm going to create and it's got a

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
built-in code editor that's great

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,440
fabulous we don't need

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,559
to touch much of what's there which can

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
add some variables so the first thing

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,600
we're going to add is a move speed

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,559
so you declare variables with var we're

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
here to teach you guys script so we're

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
going to kind of gloss over how the

00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,919
coding is working but if you've done any

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
programming in a relatively modern

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
language it should be pretty obvious

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
what's going on

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
uh so var is called move speed we're

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,840
going to say it's you know maybe 500

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,880
it seems like a good move speed to me uh

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
programming is a lot about making

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,919
numbers up

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,840
it's gonna be a lot of that today uh

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
there's a lot of game development where

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
you find yourself just sort of just

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,120
tweaking values going like

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,760
this doesn't feel right what if i double

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,520
it oh this is even worse okay what if i

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,960
oh this is great what if i harvest again

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,600
okay that's no good and then you sort of

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,559
just like

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,520
keep honing in on the specific imaginary

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,200
numbers

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,240
to do it uh there's a lot of that so we

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
have a move speed which is just an

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,039
integer we have a direction which is a

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,960
vector three it's a three part vector

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,080
three d space x y zero z so it's just

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,159
our direction could be

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,279
you know a direction uh we're gonna do

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,039
gravity so gravity

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,640
just arbitrarily you know making numbers

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,679
up on the spot here obviously no bearing

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
on the rule we're going to say gravity

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,399
is minus 9.8

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,760
yeah i wonder if that has any

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,960
relationship to the real world totally

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,640
arbitrary i'm going to give a velocity

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,360
as well so velocity is important in 3d

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,840
space

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,679
so velocity is what vector 3 as well yep

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,799
yeah

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,159
so i'm going to ignore this ready

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
function this video is called when a

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,440
node is summoned into the scene by gotto

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,480
this is your entry point into the code

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
yeah but i'm going to actually implement

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,159
a brand new function called

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,480
physics process which is a thing that's

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,919
called every physics tick uh so

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,880
gotto has predefined uh functions that

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,960
you can use

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,159
they are underscored at the start so you

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
know them apart from the ones that

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,480
you're using

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,679
uh we could go through all of them but

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,960
honestly just look them up i want to

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,080
make something that works here and not

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
explain the golo so we just want to get

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,919
you excited about god i rather than

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,440
teach you god

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,559
so inside this function physics process

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,679
this is going to get called every time

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,120
the physics tick happens

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
with the delta which is the time since

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,440
the last tick uh physics ticks are often

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
slightly slower than frame rate so our

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
direction is going to be reset to zero

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,320
that's good

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,919
and uh we're going to then check for

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,559
some input so if input

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,120
is action uh pressed which is going to

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,399
check

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
the action table and got o so we're

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,000
going to check ui left which is whatever

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,279
key we've mapped to left

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,520
i'll show you where this is set in a

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:03,200
second so goto has a full input system

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,880
you can both set uh like imaginary keys

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,799
such as left right up down or you can

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
say actual keys you go like no i want to

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,679
know that the e key

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
itself was pressed so i'm just going to

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,080
duplicate that four times and i'm going

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,200
to go ui

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,480
right uir up

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
and ui down

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,440
and for i might come back and tweak

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
these depending on which way i've

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,960
oriented the scene but for right now

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
i have it back for ui left the direction

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,399
is going to equal to one

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,320
uh ui right uh

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,159
minus one lineup yeah you are right uh

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,279
well the direction x is

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,200
equal to minus one uh and then

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,559
for this probably should be plus one

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
right yeah

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,799
um direct we'll see in a minute yeah i'm

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
gonna look like that for now

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,080
uh go ahead now yep so direction z will

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,240
be

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,240
uh

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
we'll see what happens uh yeah so that

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,519
one should be plus equals and direction

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,919
z

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,279
shall be minus one e graph b minus

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,720
equals one yeah so this is

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,320
like uh so you've got x y z

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,440
so we want these keys to move the player

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,399
around in the scene that's basically

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,679
what we're doing here now i'll just

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
quickly show you you can go up here to

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,880
the project

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,519
settings and then the input map and you

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,679
can see the ui right

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,880
okay is mapped to a key or a d-pad or

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,640
whatever is connected so

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
it's about to write up down it comes

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
with a bunch of sensors you can add your

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,120
own if you want to add an action by name

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,399
and then map keys to it so this is so

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
you can abstract the action away from

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,039
the platform it's running on because god

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,240
lets you build apps for

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,480
android ios consoles whatever okay so

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
that's done uh we need to normalize the

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,559
direction so no matter what direction

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,159
we're going in

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,840
we want to go the same speed so we're

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,480
going to say direction equals

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,080
direction.normalized

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,679
now one thing that you will have to if

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,399
you do want to do any game dev you are

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,840
going to have to be

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,240
okayish with 3d movement um it's not as

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,880
like

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,760
life or death as it's often implied in a

00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,519
lot of sort of like

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,679
people but you do have to be okay with

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
mapping 3d movement and a little bit of

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,799
3d mouths

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
and we're also going to make sure the uh

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,559
thing moves at a useful speed

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,840
because we don't want it to you know

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,799
zoom out the resistance too fast so

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,159
we're going to multiply

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,679
direction by the move speed we've set up

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,440
here and also by the delta because this

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
is being called every physics tick

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
uh the reason we're multiplying by the

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,039
delta is because otherwise if the frame

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,760
rate or the physics rate in this

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,360
case was inconsistent the movement speed

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,600
would not be nice and smooth it'd

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,960
be like jumping or teleporting or that

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,159
depending on what the uh

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,240
the time difference is so we're

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,480
basically just adding in

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,080
um how long has it been since the last

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
update that way we get a nice smoother

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,360
movement so games are all about tweaking

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,200
so in this case i would like us to

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,200
fall faster than we jump so i've just

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
done a little check for velocity here so

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,720
in this case we if we are not jumping

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,840
we fall and we fall faster than we jump

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,039
so we move down

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,840
last time we move up and that's all this

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,840
if it's doing there's a lot of like um

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
lying

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
you've got to trick a lot of the way

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,240
your brain works in game dev you

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,000
don't actually fall faster than you

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,159
should in real life

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
but if you fall at a normal rate it

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,960
feels weird so

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,480
we tend to make you plummet down we're

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,000
going to apply some gravity now so we're

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,200
just going to fill up with the velocity

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
on the y so velocity.y uh

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,279
is you know add some gravity to it but

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,559
multiply it by the delta so it doesn't

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,600
add all the gravity at once otherwise

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,440
we'll add 9.8

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,960
negative every single time it got hit

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,399
whereas we want to add a bit of 9.8

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
based on the frame rate

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,000
that's going on the physics tick yeah so

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
we want velocity dot

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,760
x equals direction.x just so they're the

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
same and because velocity is a three

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,320
part vector we want to also do velocity

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,679
y is direction

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,440
z z z not y sorry z

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,799
or else otherwise when you went up

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
versus z is direction z

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,840
okay and now we want to actually make

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
the player move so either use this input

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,000
to actually make it do something so

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
we're going to

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,120
store it in the velocity because the

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,000
velocity started as zeros and after this

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
we're going to end up with an actual

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,799
velocity that we want to keep using

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,960
so we're going to use a function called

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,799
move and slide which comes in

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,840
uh as part of gotto it basically stops

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,279
the thing from hitting anything in the

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,679
environment so if it hits something

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,120
it will stop uh pretty much every game

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,560
engine especially gotta comes with a

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,480
whole bunch of

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,760
you don't want to have to think about it

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,520
functionally and you'll see here like

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,119
i can actually command click this move

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,480
and slider it tells me it moves the body

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,919
a longer vector if the body collides

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,839
with another it will slide along another

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,040
body the other body rather than stop

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,639
it's great right

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,159
it basically just means otherwise you

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,359
don't have to do the calculations

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
yourself for when you're building

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,000
documentation is great though so we're

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,599
going to pass velocity into that

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,040
and pass a vector in telling it which

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
way is uh up

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,320
that's pretty simple so so the way up is

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,679
up why also if we want to be able to

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,079
jump so we're going to add an ability to

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
jump

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,560
so if is on floor which is another

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,960
built-in gotta function you can see that

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,320
by command clicking on it is on floor

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
uh returns through the body is on the

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,960
floor only updates when calling move and

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
slide

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,760
pretty simple right this is just gotta

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,280
inbuilt awareness of its own physics

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,960
engine

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
because physics maps can get hard very

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,880
quickly so eve is on floor

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,079
and input is action pressed

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
uh i want to make a jump so i'm going to

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,359
leave that blank for a second and i'm

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,640
just going to go velocity

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,400
dot y equals minus 10. so

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,160
we want to jump so that's what we're

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,560
doing here uh

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,160
sorry yes you're not going to travel

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,480
because uh inverse jump yeah we want to

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
uh

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
so we if we're on the floor and we push

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,240
a button that is mapped to jump we want

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,920
to go up in the air

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,040
currently we do not have an ease action

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,960
press for jump so i'm just going to go

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,240
into the project settings

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,720
input map and go game jump

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,240
click add game jumpers out at the end

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,839
i'm going to add a key

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,760
jump is going to be space bar so you can

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,640
see here space bar

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,680
i pushed another button aha game jump

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,200
add key

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,520
space okay space is mapped to game jump

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,800
now we can go is action pressed game

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,040
jump gonna keep an order completes it

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
for me it's pretty useful

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,400
that's actually everything we need to do

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,680
right now in

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
the code for the player so i'm going to

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,640
save this player.gd command s

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,079
and go back into the environment and

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,160
then i'm going to click my player

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,760
and you'll see he has a little script

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
attached to him

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,320
down here player.gd i'm going to push

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,359
command r to run it

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,440
absolutely nothing will happen because

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,720
we haven't got a camera that was

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
deliberate

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,520
trust me it is putting things underneath

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
i didn't forget that i'd not put a

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,240
camera in the scene

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,520
not even slightly uh so i'm going to add

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,960
the camera to the environment by

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,880
clicking the environment clicking

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,320
here and then i'm going to add a camera

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,520
uh goto actually comes with a few sort

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,960
of like pre-built cameras though it's

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
got a pre-built arm i'm going to move it

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
over here

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,240
and you can see this like frosting thing

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,880
which is showing us where the camera's

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,440
pointing

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,400
which is currently pointing over there

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
click this little preview button i'm

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,359
going to rotate the camera

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,359
to be something more useful

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,520
yep that's slightly useful i'm going to

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,119
rotate it down a little bit love it

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,960
okay i'm not gonna run now we should

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,240
have a view in our game and we move the

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,200
player around yep look at that look at

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,320
that he moves

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,280
it's great jump hopefully whoa look at

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
that as he jumps

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
he falls much quicker than the right he

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,560
moves at

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
yeah that's pretty cool uh but you'll

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,040
notice the camera isn't following the

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,320
player which is you know slightly not in

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,119
a video game you often you know if i go

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,400
over here

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,440
you might you know my keys are actually

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
not mapped correctly which is why i'm

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,200
having trouble moving around

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,160
i think you have to you have uh equals

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,800
when it should be a plus

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,839
oh it's working good enough it's fine so

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
i go this way right

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,400
it's not going to follow me so i can

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,520
jump off the world

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
camera didn't follow me so what i'm

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,000
going to do is i'm going to go back to

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,280
godot

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,119
and i'm going to drag the camera onto

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
the player so now the camera is parented

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,359
to the player which means it'll follow

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,920
around this is a very crude camera

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,960
follow

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,640
you could write a nice script so it

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,079
follows you around like mario 64 with a

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
little cameraman but yeah you normally

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
have like a

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,359
a low up as well so you don't you're not

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,520
hard following yourself

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,000
the camera will move with the player and

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
i can you know do something useful

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,800
this is actually hard with these keys

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,520
map like this i should probably fix the

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,720
keys

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,480
let's fix the keys let's fix the keys uh

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,480
so we need playing on duty

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,960
yeah okay let's try to figure out what

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,720
to fix have a look

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,079
it's always the fun in life tonight so

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,079
that should be a plus

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,480
equals one i think you're sure yeah

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,480
pretty sure

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,040
what's going on it's just

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
i think so our left is forward i think

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,560
that's correct now

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,079
uh well you gotta there's strings you

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,280
need a little yeah

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,480
what's that thing called yeah look okay

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,200
so now we can drive are those things

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,800
called again

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,640
quotation marks so this is all working

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,760
properly now i can drive around you know

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
i can jump up that ramp the rest

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
probably

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,119
slightly too easy if this was actually a

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,560
video game but it works uh we're gonna

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,560
add some code now to make the goal work

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,599
okay so kind of i can move that around

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,359
but it doesn't really

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,480
it won't it doesn't move very well and

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,839
it doesn't know that i scored a goal

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,800
it's good enough for actual soccer it's

00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,839
good enough for actual stock so i'm

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
gonna go back into mine

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,760
no you don't know where i'm sorry i

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
don't know i'm going to go back into

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,520
environment click on my uh

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,119
ball and i'm going to tick this little

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
box says can sleep and turn it off

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,000
because that means the ball will fall

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
asleep if we don't move it which means

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,720
it won't respond to physical impulses so

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,839
now if i go and push that ball

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,400
it will actually respond much more

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,520
pleasantly sleep is just the way the

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
game can so you see if i give it a

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,640
gentle nudge

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,160
you'll see that it uh it's a little hard

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,520
with the camera rolls nicely now instead

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,760
of just flying forward

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,520
which is much better uh what we're going

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,640
to do now is add some code to make

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,720
the goal know when it's hit

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,200
a goal but first i'm going to go into my

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,240
uh main area here which is this

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,760
environment node i'm going to add a

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,200
script to it i'm just going to quickly

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,160
write a script that lets us reset the

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,440
game

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,920
the reason you would want this is

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,520
because often you're when you're

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
tweaking values and and basically

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,280
getting the

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,040
game feel right um it's really useful to

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,720
be able to just reset the world without

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,000
too much work

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,200
i'm going to go is key pressed and just

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
look for the key enter so i'm not going

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,359
to map a nice action here like i did

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
last time it's just

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,640
brute forcing the enter key and i'm

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
going to get the tree and

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,839
reload current scene so basically you're

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
just telling that scene too

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,920
we're going to run the game again and

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,359
you'll see now that if i move around and

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,359
push enter the game resets to wherever

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,560
that sweet i love it pretty useful it's

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,920
really useful to debug your game as well

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
so now we've got that in place i'm going

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,000
to quickly

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,720
uh go into the uh

00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,839
the goal so on the upper platform i'm

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,560
going to add an area so i'm going to

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,319
move my

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,599
scene so i can go here and i'm going to

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,720
click on that upper floor

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,680
and i'm going to add an area to that

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,319
so what we're actually doing is we're

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,599
not adding a goal to the goal as such

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,319
we're going to be adding a goal

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,560
to the floor that it's on but you know

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,599
from the player's perspective that area

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,160
is here yep just need to sort of place

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,480
it roughly

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,760
it's close enough for now yep uh in the

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,960
area i'm gonna add a collision shape to

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,480
it so i'm gonna click the area and go

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,760
collision

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,680
shape quickly add a box to it this box

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,040
basically says what shape is the goal

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,319
it's straight you can see it over there

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
a little bit i'm going to scale it a bit

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,200
so it's you know

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,640
a goal that the ball so anytime the ball

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,640
goes through this thing over here

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,760
we will score a goal very simple we may

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
have made this a little too easy but

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,839
that's probably made this little too

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,240
easy

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,480
come on a little bit thinner not a

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,440
little bit as in like this one

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,200
because like you can just hit it

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,760
anywhere there we go it's better yeah

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,280
okay

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
that'll do that that's good enough you

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
can spend a little bit more time making

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,119
that

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,319
yes yes okay so we're going to add a

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,480
script to

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,280
the game to now let us score a goal so

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,680
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,280
click on this little area

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,599
and i'm going to go to the node tab over

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,960
here and you'll see this area emits a

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,720
bunch of signals

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,880
okay so these signals are things that we

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,000
can connect up to our code to make it do

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,720
things and we want to use the signal

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,920
body entered so because this node allows

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,880
us to detect when something enters it

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
we're going to use body enter so i'm

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,839
going to click body entered i'm going to

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,960
click connect down here

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,800
it's going to ask me where i want to

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,839
connect to i would like to connect it to

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,760
the environment

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,880
so we're going to click connect it's

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,960
going to add a nice

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,319
on body entered for our area to the

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,440
environment our gds script which we made

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,240
earlier i'm going to delete paths and

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,599
inside this

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,200
i'm going to go if body is rigid

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,880
body which means this can only be the

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,400
player

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,680
we will print hooray goal

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,119
into the terminal we haven't got time to

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,680
make a ui today but this will print it

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,599
into the

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,280
console i'm going to click save on that

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,800
and then i'll run the game

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
you'll see the terminal is down here

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,400
underneath this thing here where it says

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,680
i have a facetime camera so i'm going to

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,520
move up here

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,040
to the ball and try and push it through

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,359
the goal

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,560
and it says hooray goal because it knows

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,520
the ball has gone through if i do it

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,119
again you'll see

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,960
i can do it multiple times and all know

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,319
the ball has gone through that's pretty

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,800
great great

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,160
goal and that that's pretty much

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
our whole game i'm just going to go

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
quickly and make the power up do

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,520
something because you know power up

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,119
should do something

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,000
so i'm going to click on our little cube

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,839
here which is that pickup

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,440
i'm going to add a script to it because

00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,480
you know everything needs a script

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,640
inside that script i'm going to say on

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,520
process so every single frame please

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,800
make the script

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,720
the script rotate the cube so we're

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,240
going to say rotate

00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,200
x dag to rad

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,800
so uh process is called literally every

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,880
frame so that'll be running at

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,760
probably about i what what's your first

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,839
screen frame rate 120 120 yeah so it'll

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,400
be called 120 times a second give or

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,319
take

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,599
yeah and rotate on the y as well and

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,960
we're going to run that and now our cube

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,760
will rotate like a proper video game

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,440
power up

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
uh you could make the same open body

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,640
enterthing you'll send

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,000
to that to pick it up as well now we're

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,440
going to go quickly back to our slides

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and finish

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,560
uh so i mean that was you learned

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,839
something

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,400
good out of it thank you for coming
