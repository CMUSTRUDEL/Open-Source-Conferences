Abstract: This talk is about the time I became responsible for over 300+ accessibility issues in one day. As designers, developers, and managers a lot of our lives are spent beholden to the product backlog by creating, assigning, or fixing issues. But accessibility audits don’t have to be bad news! I’ll share some strategies I found to eat the proverbial elephant by using modern spreadsheet applications to breakdown and visualize your accessibility problems from a variety of different angles. It’s my hope that we can improve the accessibility audit handoff process, the development process, and the entire concept of backlogs all while preserving a sense of autonomy for everyone involved. Together, we can achieve the ultimate goal of creating more usable and accessible products.

hi

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,480
i'm dave rupert i uh i work at paravel

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,639
uh it's a three person agency based in

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,679
austin texas the best city and the best

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,320
state and the best

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
country in the whole world and uh so

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,119
we're gonna get started

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,520
uh this is a story um about unblocking

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
your

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,800
your backlogs but the story starts uh

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,880
the story starts here uh

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,559
one day hundreds of jira tickets showed

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,880
up in my inbox

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,760
my i was working uh i think it was a

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
wednesday

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
uh then all of a sudden ding ding ding

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
ding ding my my email client was kind of

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,680
just popping off it was

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,640
going amazing wow it's very busy

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
and i didn't know what was going on um i

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,440
thought there was a mistake i thought i

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,879
literally was like

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
ah there's a glitch in the the jira and

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,520
somebody made a made a big oops and now

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,199
i'm getting jira tickets

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,799
uh so i emailed the uh scrum master who

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,720
you know i didn't really like at the

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
time but hey you know that

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
that happens you know but you have to do

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,400
that sometimes so

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,799
emailed that person and uh their

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,119
response was oh i thought you knew

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,200
and that was well that triggered my

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,920
fight-or-flight response to be honest i

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
was

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
in shock uh i i didn't this was like an

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
amazing

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,119
amount of work that just showed up on my

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
desk and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,640
you know my amygdala was it was

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
triggered and so i

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,759
i just you know i i on the the

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,439
fight side of my brain you know it was

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,759
saying hey you

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,200
like accessibility you created the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,200
accessibility project a11yproject.com

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
uh you care about accessibility what a

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
great opportunity to make a big impact

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
on a site that millions of people use

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
each day

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
this is a great opportunity but the

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
flight side of my brain was saying this

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
is terrible

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,520
no one actually cares about it uh

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,320
everyone's just gonna undo your work

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
later

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
uh you need to get out of there and you

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
know the the

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,640
flight side of my brain wasn't wrong

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,840
because some simple math told me you

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,680
know it was like

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
uh what 313 issues uh divided by

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
i don't know i was doing about five

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,879
issues per sprint you know like i was

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
like getting sailing all the way through

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,680
qa i could do more but like

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
sailing all the way through qa and then

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
that would

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,959
end up being about 63 sprints of my

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,239
life which equals about two

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,599
years of my life would be dedicated

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,879
to unblocking this

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,080
backlog and i realized

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,280
like we had created

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
a logjam i mean not me personally

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,319
because i don't write bad code right

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,720
like i

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
i don't write back code at all i have

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,720
never introduced an accessibility error

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
but it's possible maybe it's possible

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,040
that i did i don't know but

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,080
like i don't do that typically but you

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
know but as an

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
organization as a whole you know we

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
maybe

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
created a problem in some technical debt

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,720
and

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,440
along the way so well i'm gonna get into

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
to this um you know maybe maybe just a

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
little refresher course on

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,319
like log jams the like actual physical

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,680
live jams

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,400
you know log jams you know are

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,159
pre-industrial days uh loggers are smart

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
people they realize yo i can

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,680
actually like save a lot of time and

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,920
energy if i go upstream

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
chop a tree down roll it in the river

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,360
send it down the river

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
and and then get it out at the bottom i

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
don't need oxes i don't need

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
steam ships i don't need trucks or

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
wagons or whatever

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,879
i just like i can chop it and use the

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
river as a machine

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
and this works you know pretty good you

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
can send quite a bit of material down

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,159
the river

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
everything goes pretty great the problem

00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,239
is if you chuck

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,280
too much inventory into the stream into

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
the river

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,680
uh they start bumping into each other

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,959
and going all cattywampus and

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
crashing and they end up uh causing

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
and then when they hit a constraint

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
right when they they hit like a bend in

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
the river

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,600
a sandbar or a rock or something

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,160
that's when they jam up and

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,720
then you have no logs going down to the

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
river

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,240
down to the mill and in some ways

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
this echoes the theory of constraints

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,600
and business parlance right like

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,120
the and you have inventory that through

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
some operational expenses

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
turned into throughput which is cash

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
and this theory of constraint was

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,199
popularized by eli goldratt

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
in his book the goal which is a book

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,479
that i would say

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,320
never judge a book by its cover uh in

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,880
fact never judge a book by

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,919
what's inside of the book either because

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,759
this book is

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,199
it's a business book and it's told in a

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,120
narrative format and that's usually a

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,039
disaster for business books but

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
it is act it actually plays out is

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,360
pretty good but if this

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,639
cover is so appalling to you then i

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
could recommend uh

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,039
there is a a graphic novel that you

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,560
could use uh

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
this is a pretty good graphic novel i

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
own it uh and i've read it a couple

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
times

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360
but then there's also the phoenix

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,400
project which is a modern adaptation

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,199
of this story uh in and it's made

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
for devops and i.t specifically which is

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
kind of the work that we do

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,600
it's actually a really cathartic read

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
and i'd recommend it like

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
wholeheartedly so uh so going back to

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
the theory of constraints right

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
so you have inventory you pay for

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
inventory you paid somebody to chop down

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,880
trees and

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
chuck them in a river operational

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,240
expenses are going to be your milling

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,520
uh your saws your gas for the cars or

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,880
the cranes or whatever

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
it in actually even time on the river

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
is an operational expense because time

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
is money right so

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
if you have a bloc backlog and the logs

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
are stuck in the river for 10 days well

00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
that's 10 days you're paying people to

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
work

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,360
but they can't do work right and

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,199
throughput is the work

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
where you get money and i was looking at

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
this and i was i was kind of realizing

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,680
like this is sort of a similar

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,600
situation with bugs in my own backlog

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
in some ways like a bug's life is very

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
similar right the bug

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,520
exists in the code base right the bug

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
just exists and then we discover the bug

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
and we chuck it in the river and then

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
there's this magic point the triage

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,840
right where where we go through the

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
backlog

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
and we turn that into a ticket or

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,360
whatever into something that can be

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,199
worked on and then it's assigned as well

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,600
but then that work is performed and that

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,080
bug is fixed and i realized like

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
oh this is kind of it like if you chuck

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
too many

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
issues in the backlog in the roadmap or

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
whatever and then

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
something goes wrong boom you hit a jam

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
i know what you're thinking this is that

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,240
and this is a talk about the no backlogs

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,880
thing i've heard about from

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,039
the uh david heinemer hansen's and the

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
37 signals no backlogs that's the answer

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,759
right

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
well you wouldn't be wrong like from a

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,880
theory of constraints perspective

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,440
like that's actually a pretty legit idea

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
just like

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
never put too many things into the

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,080
machine like

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,759
optimize for your throughput never put

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,800
too many tickets in the machine

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,639
uh unless you can do them

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
there's also some interesting economics

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,919
right like it's very

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,759
cheap to file a bug but very expensive

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
to fix a bug so now you have like a

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,160
disparity there right it's very

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,720
cheap to come up with a feature idea but

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
very expensive to implement a feature

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
so you have to think about that like

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
that's very

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,280
like astute if you're starting to think

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,039
this way but

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
i couldn't just delete my backlog right

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,680
i can't walk into an enterprise

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,440
organization

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
just command a and delete the whole

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,400
thing right like i can't do that

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,440
uh i had i was in the job of undoing the

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,879
backlog right

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,479
and so this is how like

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
we get back to this old question right

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,720
like how do you eat the proverbial

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
elephant

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,680
how do you do it well conventional

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,039
wisdom says one bite at a time right

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,639
just get to eating not gonna matter

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,080
but my perspective like i've never eaten

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
an elephant before

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
are there more delicious parts does

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,039
elephant have bacon

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,720
uh is there good parts of elephant and

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,560
bad parts of elephant i would like to

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,199
know this about elephant before i just

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,440
start to

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
eat the whole damn thing so this is kind

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,520
of where i

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,800
uh sort of disagree with the age-old

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,640
wisdom

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,839
rather than just starting like nose to

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,680
tail like i'm kind of

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,680
interested are there are there easier

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,200
things to where i could get into this

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,480
new hobby

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,880
with without uh kind of uh going

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,160
losing my mind or whatever kind of just

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
just

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
kind of wearing down my spirit really um

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
so

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,480
it's good to first take a break

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
right and understand how accessibility

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,680
audits are performed

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,440
i'm talking about accessibility audits

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,200
and specifically but you

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
might have another kind of audit like

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
whatever security compliance audit or

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
uh you could have dozens of different

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
things uh or even just a

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,800
big gnarly backlog but let's talk about

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
accessibility audits and how they're

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,839
performed right

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
so they're often done by experts and and

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
i

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,760
say this i don't want to change the

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
accessibility auditing thing because

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,080
they

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
do a good job but they're often done

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
screen by screen button by button

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,640
requirement by requirement browser by

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,760
browser platform by platform

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,160
it's very thorough work and

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,000
you know you you get into this and and

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,800
it's a lot of work

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,279
but uh and i'll show an example later

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
where they found 90 issues on one single

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,080
component

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,399
of a site one single component 90 issues

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
that's 33 different will cag violations

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
eight different assistive technologies

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
were used

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,519
to test this work this works done by

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
experts i don't want to change that but

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
remember the goal is to eat the elephant

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,360
so like how do how do we do that right

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
so one limitation of accessibility

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
audits is they're often focused on the

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,360
output

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,480
and ignorant of the input and i mean

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
that in the most benign

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,120
like like nice sense of the word because

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
they should be focused on the output

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
they should be

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
like looking at the output like what

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,920
does the screen reader read

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
or what does the braille reader read is

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
this operable through like a keyboard

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,560
only

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
they're focused on the output but

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,320
they're often ignorant of the part i

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,920
work on the input right

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
and if there was just a one-to-one

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,959
mapping between this page and the output

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,800
the input and the output

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
that would be great my job would be easy

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
but i've decided to make my job more

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
complicated so i actually operate on

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,959
like about a dozen files at a time

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,200
so if somebody reports a fi a problem in

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,320
the output i have to find out which file

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,839
in the input

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,680
it actually was and you know because we

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
do that for a reason right because we

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,720
want to reuse code

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
but often accessibility audits are very

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
repetitive

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,360
due to how we reuse our code so if you

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
have a problem

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,880
on page one well guess what

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,399
the next five ten fifteen pages are

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
gonna have the same problem

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,040
because i intentionally built it that

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
way i built it to reuse the code

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
so i built it to have problems on every

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,160
page because i'm

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,560
i only want to write problems once

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,800
accessibility oughts are often ignorant

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,519
of easy versus hard in the underlying

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,959
system

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,160
does anyone know the difference between

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,839
these two pages anyone anyone

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,519
yeah it's tough to tell from the outside

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,720
right but this is one of them's on the

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
production database

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
high level of effort to change if you

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
have to add like a

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
attribute or something or a field to the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,920
database oh man

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,760
that's people come out of the woodworks

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,320
and security compile every

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
that's a big deal but if you have like a

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,200
static site

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
well that's a low effort that's an easy

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
change

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,519
you know ones often the accessibility

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,760
offer

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
audits are often ignorant of the metrics

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,800
and the relative importance of the page

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,600
anyone know the difference between these

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,440
two pages anyone anyone

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
well it's really obvious one gets like a

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
million views a day it's a very high

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
impact page

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
and one gets about 5 000 views maybe a

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
month

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
it's very low impact page you got to

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,200
think about that

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
you don't know that so so they're

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,519
weighted differently

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,920
a little bit you know one example was we

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,040
had

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
alt text is missing issues pretty easy

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
fix but

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,519
anyone know the difference between these

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
two pages well again this one was on the

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,720
production database

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
millions of views a day it will take

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,200
weeks to fix because we have make the

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,959
change

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
it's got that change has to go to the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
level one staging that thing has to go

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
to qa then it has to run through all the

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,639
qa and then it has to go into production

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
that has to pass all the tests

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,040
it takes a long time to fix that issue

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,200
um and then but the static site i could

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,639
take fix it in minutes i could fix 500

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,279
static site issues than this time it

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,920
would take

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,920
to fix one production database issue

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,240
this is all to say accessibility objects

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,839
are good but they have some limitations

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,360
so getting back to the original question

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,079
how to eat the proverbial elephant

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
we were having digestive issues we were

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,200
not having a good time wrangling our

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,480
head

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,360
around how to do this and so

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
we kind of realized like a chronological

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
list

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
of issues basically that's what we got

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
from the offshore audit team

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,040
was it wasn't you know they started on

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,160
one page and went to the

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,200
the end of the site and they just filed

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,200
issues for each page

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,639
a chronological list of issues wasn't

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
that really helpful

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
and the offshore team had labeled things

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
high medium and low priority

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,480
which turned out to be like radically

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,279
wrong but that's

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,199
like but but it wasn't so much that was

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,760
incorrect it was that we didn't have any

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,320
context for how they were weighted or

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,079
or gauged so that was like it was

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,680
unclear how these issues were

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,079
related or how they were weighted

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,920
so i dug around and i tried to figure

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
out how have people like done this in

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,639
the past

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,160
i searched the blogs i went to the blogs

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
and there's a actually a really good

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,440
post

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,639
by steve klabnik who's actually speaking

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,079
in the next session

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
uh not in this channel but in a

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,399
different channel steve klapnik was

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,000
uh he works on rust right now but he was

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,199
working on ruby on rails at the time in

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,279
2012 and 2014.

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,880
but steve i think was getting involved

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,639
or just said i'm you know i'm gonna

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,920
go through all these issues there were

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
800 issues on the ruby on rails board

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,680
and

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
800 issues and they would get 25 30 a

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
day

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,199
showing up so how did did steve eat the

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,000
elephant

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
well he went through he basically opened

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,360
a new tab

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,199
clicked all the issues open new tabs and

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
then like read through top to bottom

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,480
every single

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,920
issue every single comment and then read

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
it close out the window read it close

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,120
out the one that read it

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,320
and went through like all 800 issues it

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,079
took him two days

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,519
to read all 800 issues and then

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,880
no he did did he start like assigning it

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:10,320
no that's not what he did he

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,880
he read through it again and so when you

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
like read through it again you now have

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,160
like context and you can start building

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,720
relationships through

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,720
issues like like seeing like oh that

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,199
issue is similar to that issue

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
and so he was able to do better triaging

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,079
the second

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,199
read-through because he had now seen

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
like duplicates and

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
and different things and he was able to

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,720
kind of come up with a metric like

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
is this a feature request oh okay we

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
handle those a little bit differently

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
through like

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,040
rfcs or whatever is this a request for

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
help oh that should probably go to stack

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
overflow okay

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,639
so easy close those out uh is this for

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
an older version of reels

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
okay if like a new version of rails

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,800
fixes it that might help

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
does this have repro steps uh if it

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,519
doesn't like

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,199
sorry can't help you like that's

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
basically basic open source

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,680
uh can i repro the issue against the

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
head the the latest version

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,600
if i can't then maybe it's been fixed

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,360
but if it's still a bug that can be

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,519
reproduced against the head

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
the latest version of the project well

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,199
then maybe it's an actual bug and he can

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
assign that to the relevant subsystem

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,000
maintainer

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,759
ah what a good story what a good way to

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
break down the whole thing

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
but it took two read-throughs of all

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
these issues and more issues are showing

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,519
up each day

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,199
so i did this with our work and i

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
started reading through all the

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,360
300 issues and i started seeing similar

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
problems and started making connections

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,320
and took

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,880
a few notes here and there lots of my

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,600
issues were for pages that didn't exist

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,959
anymore what how do you get a bug on the

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
page that doesn't exist

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,079
i don't know but that's what happened

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,120
and so

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
we we had issues and so i it was kind of

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,920
like okay this is

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,160
there's clearly some like problems here

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,199
that i we maybe need to address

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
but we're kind of hitting the

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,360
limitations of jira right like

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
jira is great software don't wanna

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
poopoo it like if you use it that's

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,000
great

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,040
but having like 300 issues in the to-do

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,240
column

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,439
does not isn't super great um you can

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,360
switch it to a list view

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,480
but that's still like 300 issues in a

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,640
to-do column and

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
and you have to like click into each

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
issue to get more information

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
and we're kind of like it was kind of

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
like a goldilocks problem like the the

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,439
board or the list issue

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,319
didn't have enough information and the

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,640
the

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,919
detail view had too much information so

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
we kind of like

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
we're having struggle in like processing

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,360
this information

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,760
and maybe you could like you have jirafu

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,520
and you can like

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
write a query the perfect query that

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,840
fixes all this and like that's cool but

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,240
i did not have either access or

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,679
the skills to do that um we actually

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
found it was easier to pull all the

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
issues

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,760
down and put them in excel boring right

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,000
but like this was easier than like the

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
project management tool

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
project you know i'll just read through

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,280
these issues project 123

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
missing alt attribute on page that's a

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,520
high priority uh one two four

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,039
focus not visible on hamburger menu high

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
priority one two five

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,120
uh pages missing alt attribute that

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,799
looks like one two three but worded

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,480
opposite but whatever that's a medium

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
priority for some reason same issue but

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,200
medium

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,520
one two six missing three to one

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
contrast on search that's a low priority

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,440
okay

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,559
um and then one two seven focus not

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,320
visible on checkout

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840
that's a medium priority but here's the

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,039
thing it's medium priority but here's

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,960
what i know

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,120
out his very sense of page if you start

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
changing checkout everyone gets mad

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,640
because that's how they make money and

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
so if you change checkout

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,039
everyone gets mad and so wouldn't it be

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,799
nice if we had a little bit more data

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,400
in our spreadsheet and this is what we

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,919
kind of did we sort of kind of went

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,039
through and we're like what page is

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
being affected

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,880
right oh that's for the about page uh

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
okay missing alt attribute

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
on the about page not really a high

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,400
priority to be honest but whatever

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,679
um the the focus not visible is on

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,559
every page it's global issue uh the

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,120
missing alt attribute uh is on features

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,919
okay that's

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
a bit a little more high priority uh and

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,360
then

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,640
missing contrast on search that's uh all

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,559
global and then again the checkout page

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,000
um and i just happen to know that

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,240
features would be like

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
uh the the that would require a database

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
change in that particular instance

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,440
but wouldn't it but we don't build page

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,039
by page right i already said that like

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
we don't build page by page we build

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,000
like component by component or object by

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
object or what

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,280
you know design systems is kind of the

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,600
work i do but

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,880
so which component is affected would be

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,400
super helpful to me

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,559
right like oh this one is like for the

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,480
is an image component and this one's a

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
header this is the global header this is

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
an image component

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,880
this is header but it's also forms okay

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
that really helps me out

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,160
and this is just a form on the checkout

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
oh well that's kind of

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
easy actually if it's just a form on the

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
checkout

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
but again sensitive but wouldn't it be

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,000
great if we knew

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,559
like what the problem was like if

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,039
not just like a general abstraction of

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
like

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,320
these summaries that don't match like

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
what if we knew the exact problem

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,799
right and we could maybe add another

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
column for the actual wiki violation

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,799
actually sorry they don't say violation

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
they say we'll catch success criteria

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,760
because that's

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,039
positive and violations are negative but

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,000
whatever so

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,640
it's what violation or sorry success

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
criteria

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,120
are we not meeting um non-text content

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,159
that's alt attributes almost always

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,200
focus visible

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,600
non-text content non-text contrast

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,159
aha you gotta read carefully and then

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,559
focus visible again

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,320
so when we look at this we start seeing

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,520
new dimensions right and we can add

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,400
numbers

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,880
and look at this like if we had tallies

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
like

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,880
it's five issues but it's only on four

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,799
pages

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
and it's four pages but it's three

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,600
components

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,799
it's three components but it's really

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,640
only three problems

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,400
so either of those any of those numbers

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
are better than five like four is better

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
than five

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,200
3 is better than 5. um all of these are

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,159
better

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
so but the other thing is you can like

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,039
in

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,919
we're hitting the the limits of excel

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,679
now because like

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,559
you can like sort by a column in excel

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,679
but like you can really only visualize

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,440
one dimension at a time

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,280
you can like get into pivot tables but

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,080
that's a little

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,039
weird too in gnarly territory and it

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,159
doesn't

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,440
it's not a great situation so i started

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,200
wondering could we leverage

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
modern spreadsheeting applications and

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
i'm going to talk about notion

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,080
specifically in this talk uh airtable is

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,400
another one

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,000
i had mixed results um full disclosure

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,080
i've worked with their table in the past

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
but i had mixed results like doing this

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
workflow specifically in airtable

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,480
and then codaio is something i learned

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,600
about recently but they actually

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,600
have a workflow for managing your jira

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,280
in their tool so it would be worth

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,320
checking out and they have videos online

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,159
of how to do this

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,080
very similar thing and so like i

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
actually kind of recommend that one

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
like because it seems very optimized and

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
it can actually like sync to a jira

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,600
query

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,440
that's kind of cool anyway so

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
i but i was curious like could we use

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,600
these new tools to kind of experience

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
multiple dimensions at once and build

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
something more

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,679
helpful like this so i'm going to walk

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,400
through the process of creating a

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,000
multi-dimensional accessibility audit

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,440
and for uh the for this talk

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,679
uh i can't share my clients

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,280
accessibility audit legal was not super

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,799
happy with that idea

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,760
so uh i'm gonna use this thing from wp

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,919
campus

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
uh who commissioned an audit from

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,120
tenonio who's a really

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,919
reputable accessibility firm uh for the

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,720
uh they audited the gutenberg uh

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,480
wordpress

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
editor which is kind of the new editing

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,240
experience inside wordpress

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,240
uh and back when this happened 2018 2019

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
there was a lot of fear uncertainty and

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,960
doubt around this new editor

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,640
uh like it's accessibility and uh they

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,960
just said well you know let's solve this

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
uh let's let's commission an audit and

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
see what's actually going

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
on um and and it was all mixed because

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
automatic

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,440
who owns wordpress was kind of just like

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,120
we're just putting it in anyway we

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
believe in this we're betting on this

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,200
so it was a you know there's a lot of

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,600
doubt in the community uh or

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
uncertainty and so they commissioned not

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,600
it and the audit is actually

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
best of breed like like tenon did an

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
amazing job

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,080
there's a 300 page summary of like

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,159
detailed

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,280
how to fix every single problem there's

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,440
a uh

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,720
like a whatever 10-page executive

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
summary that you can hand off to your

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
bosses

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,440
and then critically there was like a

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,080
whole spreadsheet of all the problems

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,919
a csv file of all the problems which i'm

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,960
going to use in this talk here

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,400
so step one was import the data right uh

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,880
so we get a spreadsheet boring as heck

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,840
i'm already bored but let's just import

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
it into notion

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:04,480
and see what happens

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,279
i'm like like already 33 percent more

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,799
chill right now

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,200
like just looking at this compared to

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,679
the last one so this is good

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
but i can already kind of identify like

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,440
quite a few

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,520
repetitive bits like that that issue key

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,799
says

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,520
that's not useful to me so

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,559
step two is hide some columns let's just

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,720
hide them

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,240
so in these tools you can usually like

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,080
find a column and just

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,679
say like oh you know what hide it i

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,520
don't want to see it anymore or you can

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
go into this bulk thing and start hiding

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,320
things

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,000
like the project name was just gut uh

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,039
the issue key we don't need

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,880
um we can go hide uh

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,559
i don't know like descriptions you never

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
want a description in a spreadsheet like

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,320
ever and then recommended code

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
fixes yeah get rid of that i don't want

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,360
to look at that in spreadsheet

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,760
and now we've simplified things quite a

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,320
bit but you could still see some

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,039
repetitiveness right like like there's

00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
like seven

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,400
columns of components so that tells me

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,919
there's like a repeating kind of thing

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
and then the issue type it looks like

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,720
there's only one or two types there

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,360
so we can kind of start converting these

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,440
columns to selects and multi selects

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,200
which is the the vernacular that they

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,360
use but you just go in you click the

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,520
header of the cell

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,760
and you just kind of use this drop down

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,279
to change it to a select but then

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,120
columns where there's like repeated

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,600
columns and you can go

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,360
and uh switch it to what's called a

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,559
multi-select which kind of allows you to

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,240
put more than one

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,080
value in there you know i have to do

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
this manual migration of pulling things

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,240
over

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,080
there may be a way you can like do that

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
in excel or something

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,000
like before you import or whatever but

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
you know i just kind of went through and

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,720
i

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,159
kind of clean this all up and then you

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
know guess what

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,200
i'm done with those columns and i can

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,559
hide them

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,159
easy let's be done this is this is the

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,960
best part of my job when i get to

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,440
hide something in a spreadsheet step

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,520
four

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
man it's boring right let's color let's

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,039
get fancy

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,000
this is your board let's color warnings

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,120
aren't gray

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,080
warnings need to be i don't know

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,400
yellow cause of soccer or orange i don't

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
know

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
yellow and then bugs are red because

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,120
that's a don't

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,200
that's a stop and pay attention to this

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,880
maybe it's green maybe it's an emoji

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
whatever you want it to be it can be

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
that

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,320
uh i i color coded everything i color

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,520
coded all the assistive technologies

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,799
i color coded all the wicked violations

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,200
i'm that anal and i'll do that

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,919
so after you've color coded your whole

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
board

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,080
like made it pretty and fancy how you

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,880
want it go through and add

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,760
counts so this is what i showed you

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
before but

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,360
we did in the excel but once you start

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
counting all these things

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,440
you start to get some interesting data

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,919
like oh look for components there's

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,360
actually

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,880
16 components and then

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,880
it's going to be kind of towards the end

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,440
of the the thing but uh

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,080
let's see here yeah the the wookhag

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
success

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,400
criteria that we are uh violating uh

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
there's only 26.

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
so that actually tells me there were 90

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,559
issues

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,760
in this one text editor but it's only 16

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
pieces there's 26 things wrong in 16

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,279
components

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
26 violations in 16 components and

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,960
that's a way

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
easier way for my brain to digest things

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,399
and i can start

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,039
to kind of mind map and build

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,880
build some like very interesting

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,559
associations

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,360
so the next thing we want to do is add

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,120
dimensions and there's some really cool

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
technology that you can do here so you

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,520
can like just go through these views and

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,440
add a view

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
so let's get all the the component the

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,279
title block let's get all the issues for

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,360
the title block just a simple list of

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,240
components right so we'll add a filter

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,000
we'll filter by title block um this

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,440
should be pretty easy

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
okay great for issues next let's go

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,640
through

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,039
uh group by component let's just like

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,760
group all the issues by component right

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,000
so we'll make a combine and board and

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,200
we'll group by component look at this

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,520
you can pick and choose whatever

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
component maybe sally worked on the text

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,039
block component and she can just go

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,520
through all the text blocks that's all

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,279
those are all sally's well we'll have to

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
figure that we'll have to let sally know

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,640
but she's going to have to work on those

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,919
uh group by wick violation or success by

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,360
success criteria um you know this

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,960
this is kind of helpful oh i made a

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
table sorry but these tools are really

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,200
forgiving

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,320
so you can just like flip it into a

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,640
board we'll figure that out uh

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,399
it's okay but you group by success

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,640
criteria and maybe you can like figure

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,720
out like oh like that's the focus

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
ones are all here we could maybe fix all

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,679
these focus ones and i needed a little

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
bit more information there so i could

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,559
just add another field in so that's

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,200
pretty cool

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,880
uh and then like the next one is like

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
group by platform

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,960
like what assistive technology is

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,080
affected by this and this one's cool

00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
because like look look

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,520
i color coded all the windows once but

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,039
oh windows high contrast that's a really

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,039
actually fun one to work on

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,960
and oh there's mac voice over ios

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,559
voiceover i don't own a mac so that'll

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,520
have to be somebody else who does that

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
work

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,039
group by population and this one's my

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
favorite

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,880
okay so we're going to go create a board

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,559
and we'll group by the population

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,600
affected which is something that 10n

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
gave us

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,880
in their audit but look at this we now

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,200
have numbers

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,919
for the population effective we can now

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,520
tell who our application is actively

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,919
discriminating against

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,880
isn't that great does your application

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
know who you're

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
actively discriminating against probably

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,360
not

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,399
but look now we have some data and for

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
me the like

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,480
the cognitive impairment one is like the

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,679
biggest column and that's actually very

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,279
interesting to me because

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
for me i actually struggle with

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,360
cognitive impairment uh

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,480
issues the most because there is sort of

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,200
you know it's a mixture of

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,679
disabilities in under that umbrella from

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
you know

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,600
uh mental retardation to autism to

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,760
even dyslexia uh a lot of issues under

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,880
that umbrella but often the fixes

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,520
required in there

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
is is kind of big fixes like oh you put

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,039
a drop down on

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,000
that un changes something above it or

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,399
something like so

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
your ux is usually bad there and so

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,640
that's like a bigger

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,159
fix than even just like a add focus

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
states

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,600
but with this data we can actually build

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,120
something very

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,559
very cool and very useful and very uh

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,960
i don't know very inclusive so wrapping

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,080
up

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,120
real quick we started with this and we

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,960
ended with this

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,120
and we can build out all these different

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,760
dimensions and visualize our data

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,200
however we want to i think that's very

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,080
powerful is very fast

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,120
it's very quick and you just it's easier

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,760
than

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,159
building a jira query for me we went

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,679
from 38 columns to about 10 columns in

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,760
our spreadsheet

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,919
i'm instantly more relaxed that's

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,760
literally like

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,480
like for whatever uh 400 improvement for

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,720
me

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,080
how did it work out for us is maybe the

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,960
big question and

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
we were actually able me and uh two or

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,880
three other people

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,080
were able to actually clear out 142 of

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
the 313

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,080
total issues 46 in about two and a half

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,120
months with like part-time capacity

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,559
no one was on accessibility full-time we

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,880
were all doing other stuff but

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,320
we we closed out that many issues and

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,200
again like the biggest one

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,519
kind of going around in a con clockwise

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,799
uh

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,640
was 50 issues were unreproducible

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,399
they just literally the pages didn't

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,120
exist anymore or they shouldn't exist

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,320
anymore

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,679
uh so they just need to be deleted uh

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,440
the next 19 were contrast issues

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,519
which was actually ended up being a

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,720
problem with the color sampling tool

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,840
that they used

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,679
the offshore team used on the the

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,039
site 19 or 15 issues for the promo code

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,720
i won't read all these but

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,399
we just basically went through and we

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,679
are able to make some pretty fixes

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,760
in a dramatic amount less amount i was

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,840
expecting spending two years on this and

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,720
it was like two and a half months we got

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,960
through most things

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,240
and then unfortunately my contract ended

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
so

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,399
i want to give some thoughts on uh

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
improving workplace satisfaction via the

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,240
blog

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,600
the backlog process um just kind of

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,519
before we go here uh

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,200
individuals and interactions over

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,360
process and tools

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
is from the agile manifesto but but i

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,120
think like the way things have happened

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,720
is we become kind of we we just want to

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,600
get through the two-week sprint the

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,720
process

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,120
and clear out the jira the bor the tool

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,320
um and we kind of miss out on some of

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
the humanity

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,159
uh the autonomy of things you know

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,760
daniel pink

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,919
does like some self-help books and stuff

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,240
but he kind of has narrowed

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,840
uh like that individuals need like three

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,919
things right

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,279
autonomy taking on what interests you

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,360
mastery feeling

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,320
of getting better at things purpose

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,799
doing something bigger than yourself

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,360
and uh you know when we're kind of just

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,279
just

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,200
burdened by this backlog it takes a

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,960
really an emotional toll

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
and and often you don't have the

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,399
autonomy of taking on what interests you

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,360
you just have to get through things

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,720
maybe you have like that but you don't

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,480
you know if you don't have the mastery

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,919
if you keep doing the same five problems

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,200
over and over you maybe don't feel like

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
you're growing or

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
gaining mastery and then purpose is a

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,039
big one

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,480
like for me like accessibility issues

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,799
have a lot of built-in purpose like i'm

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,159
making the world a better place

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,200
and that's very good to me but if the

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
organization

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
the entropy of the organization is to

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,960
undo accessibility work or create more

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,399
accessibility work

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,760
then i don't feel like it has purpose

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,320
so i know what you're saying ah no

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,480
backlogs that's where you were going

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,480
yeah ideally but i think like the step

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,640
is to get to know log jams first

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,080
like i kind of have like four quick tips

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,559
i think that can help

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,600
get to no log jams and and here's what i

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,279
think you

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,039
can help get there tip one avoid

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,879
extensive audits like

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,280
start with a few core templates first

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,280
again like we reuse code right

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,200
and we replicate problems across our

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,040
code so

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,800
chances are if you fix one on page one

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,280
it'll be fixed on page two three and

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,800
four

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,440
so start on on very small pieces

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,879
of when auditing things jerry mcgovern

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
is one of my favorite speakers but he

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,800
talks about this idea of top tasks

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
like what's the top thing your user has

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,040
to do does it have to add something to

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
cart

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,800
great let's work on the add to cart flow

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,720
is it they have to check

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,720
out so because that's how we get money

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,960
then yes let's work on the checkout flow

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,159
if they have to sign up does your your

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,639
your application need

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,879
signups then then make the signup flow

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,720
perfect just take one piece at a time

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,919
and chances are like if you're building

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,639
component by component

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,040
or whatever like you'll you'll fix that

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,599
and

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,880
if your application has like low code

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,760
reviews well then

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,200
like at least somebody learned something

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,520
and now they have a skill for when it

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,359
shows up on the next page

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,560
tip number two is deliver issues in

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,119
small packs

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,800
of related issues um and this is maybe

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,520
for accessibility auditors but really

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,599
anyone but

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,760
but literally like in a pack that

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,320
somebody can carry i use this backpack

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,960
like what's what's like the number of

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,800
issues

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
that somebody can carry if you give

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,880
somebody 313

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,280
issues that's that's a burden but you

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,960
know have

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,200
anyone seen anyone with a desktop that

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
looks like this that's awful that's it

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,200
gives me the uh but

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,599
if it looks like this well i'm instantly

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,440
more calm and cool and collected

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,520
and now we have packs of issues you can

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,440
fix alt attributes fix focus states

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,040
oh modal sally worked on modals those

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
are going to go over to sally cyrusally

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,920
but

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,680
but may well ask sally but those

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,839
if you break them into packs like in

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,440
your backlog is organized more like this

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,119
things are going to make a lot more

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,800
sense and be a lot easier to digest

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,119
i think about this like back when i was

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,400
a kid right like you get a lego set and

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,359
you open the legos and then

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,280
boom like 500 legos shoot out into the

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,359
carpet and get stuck in there

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,320
uh nowadays when my son opens the lego

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,240
set well

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,839
they're all numbered packages and these

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
packages are awesome because they like

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,599
progressively

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
they are basically progressive bundles

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,240
like oh you're on phase one of the

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,599
project oh you're on phase two

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,160
phase three phase four they're like

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,599
progressive bundles of pieces

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
and i think there's a lot of inspiration

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,599
here of like

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,119
how you might be able to deliver packs

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,720
of issues

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,359
and kind of getting into the progressive

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,000
idea here like gamify the experience by

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,520
progressively

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
increasing the difficulty and i don't

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,880
mean like give people badges for like

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,720
completing accessibility issues although

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,040
that might be cool but i doubt it

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,160
uh i mean more like mario right like

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,160
world one one

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,000
you like just learn how to run right and

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,200
jump that's every mario ever

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,359
is just learning how to move the

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,520
character and jump in world one one

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,640
world two you start getting new enemies

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,480
you start getting new

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,240
power ups and stuff like that and so it

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,480
starts getting a little more complex but

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,240
then by the last world world four

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
you're like having to use all these

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,720
things in combination the the

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,160
power-ups the jumping everything has to

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,240
work in concert

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,640
uh you know and i think we could do that

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,960
as we kind of build our products like

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,480
like maybe world one is fixing all

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,400
attributes world two

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,480
oh we that requires collaborating with

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,480
the designer to fix contrast issues same

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
with focus states

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
i think there's ways to like build these

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,200
things you know

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,440
there's in open source there's the good

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,079
first issue hashtag that's a really good

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,680
thing too like like these are easy

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,680
low-hanging fruit to to

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,839
do fixes but my last tip is to

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,079
care about accessibility before legal

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,720
shows up like there's no replacement for

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,400
caring

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,320
same with the security talk we heard in

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,000
the keynote this morning you have to

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
build it into the culture and if people

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
don't care

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,599
it's not going to get done and you're

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,880
just going to have a backlog of

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,200
accessibility problems because you

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,400
didn't care about accessibility

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,040
so again i wish you the best uh on

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,160
on getting towards no log jams i really

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,000
hope it works out for you

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,520
and i want to give a quick thanks to uh

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,079
two of my friends young wang

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,960
who i co-host a video game podcast with

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,280
uh but

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,800
uh jan was sort of a guinea pig for kind

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,599
of trying out these multi-dimensional

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
accessibility

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
issue ideas and then my friend

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,200
christopher schmidt

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,880
who passed away earlier this year he was

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,320
always an advocate for the things i was

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
doing always very interested but

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,400
he also worked at a accessibility

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
consultancy and gave me some feedback on

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,960
how this

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,920
fits into their process and how it fits

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,200
into my process as a developer

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,520
