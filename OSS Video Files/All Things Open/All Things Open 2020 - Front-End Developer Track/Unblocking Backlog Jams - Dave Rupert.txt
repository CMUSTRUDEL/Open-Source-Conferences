Abstract: This talk is about the time I became responsible for over 300+ accessibility issues in one day. As designers, developers, and managers a lot of our lives are spent beholden to the product backlog by creating, assigning, or fixing issues. But accessibility audits don’t have to be bad news! I’ll share some strategies I found to eat the proverbial elephant by using modern spreadsheet applications to breakdown and visualize your accessibility problems from a variety of different angles. It’s my hope that we can improve the accessibility audit handoff process, the development process, and the entire concept of backlogs all while preserving a sense of autonomy for everyone involved. Together, we can achieve the ultimate goal of creating more usable and accessible products.
