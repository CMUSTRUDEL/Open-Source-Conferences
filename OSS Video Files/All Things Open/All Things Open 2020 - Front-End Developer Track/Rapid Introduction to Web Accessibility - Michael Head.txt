Abstract: Web accessibility is a growing topic of interest among many practitioners in software development, from designers to product managers to developers. If you're not familiar with the topic it can be overwhelming at first. This talk serves as a crash course into web accessibility to help people get a grasp on the topic overall and figure out where they can go to learn more. It's useful for designers, developers, product managers, or anyone else involved in product development. Come learn about why accessibility is important, what all those acronyms mean (WCAG, ATAG, WAI-ARIA, oh my!), and about some of the tools of the trade.

hi everybody

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,320
thanks for coming to a rapid

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,320
introduction to web accessibility

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,920
my name is michael head i'm a solution

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
architect at a consulting company named

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,119
slalom i'm a certified web accessibility

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,400
specialist

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,160
and trusted tester trusted tester is an

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,760
accessibility certification the us

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,480
federal government provides

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,480
i'll touch on it a little bit later and

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
since this is a short session we'll jump

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
right

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,000
in here's what we'll be talking about

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,399
today uh we'll define web accessibility

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
go over some assistive technologies and

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,879
then we'll discuss

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,399
prioritizing measuring and

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,000
building accessible web interfaces

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
i'll have my contact information at the

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
end and it's in the chat if you want to

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,320
get in touch

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,079
to ask questions later

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,239
so what is web accessibility

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
here's one definition for web

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,720
accessibility

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
websites tools and technologies are

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,200
designed

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
and developed so that people with

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
disabilities can use them

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
pretty straightforward i think i believe

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,840
this comes from the wike

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
guidelines i've broadened it here a

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,220
little bit

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,360
because i think it warrants

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,280
[Music]

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
integrating accessibility into user

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,240
experience design and development

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,920
so my version is making user interfaces

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
usable for the widest

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,040
possible combination of users and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,000
contexts

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,680
as is feasible so this is illustrated by

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
this graphic on the right which is from

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
the microsoft inclusive design

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,799
toolkit is weak

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
disabilities can range from permanent

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,600
disabilities someone having one arm

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
temporary to temporary disabilities and

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
arm injury

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,360
to sort of contextual disabilities

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,119
of holding groceries in one arm a baby

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
in one arm you only have

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,159
the ability to use that one arm during

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,880
that time so

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
interfaces built for those kinds of

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,200
situations help

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,400
people in all those instances

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,040
not just folks that are what you might

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
say traditionally disabled

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,879
well let's look at another real world

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,160
example that we may not normally think

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,360
of in terms of accessibility

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,640
so most people can probably read that

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,760
the the top line but can can you read

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
the second line or the third line

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,040
if you have glasses or contacts and you

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
took those out

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
could you read the same lines then if

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,080
you couldn't would you be considered

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
disabled

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
aren't glasses and contacts assistive

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
technology

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
here's an example where we have to

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
consider font size and color contrast

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,560
for the sake of legibility

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
the contexts also matters though on a

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,879
larger screen or printed out

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,800
these may be perfectly legible but

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,840
viewing in a poorly lit room may make it

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
hard to read

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
plus your own eyesight matters so it's

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
usability within a particular context

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
in this case these lines get

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,640
progressively worse

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
with regards to accessibility compliance

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
as we go from top to bottom

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,080
the first la line passes three

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,280
triple a for workhead guidelines for any

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
font size

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
the second line has to be larger text in

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,360
this case it's bold

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
just to pass double a and then the

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
bottom line fails

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,480
double a altogether and we'll get more

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,599
into the compliance on what that means

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,200
in in a little bit

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,200
so what does accessibility look like

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,040
from our user's perspective

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,840
it often includes the use of assistive

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
technologies software or hardware

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
that improves the experience of users

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,920
with disabilities

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
here's a very short list of assistive

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,400
technologies that users might use to

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,360
overcome a challenge with using

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,760
interfaces it's a very short list

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
because

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
there are many other kinds of software

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
and hardware out there

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,239
screen readers are probably the most

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,120
well known in the

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,959
web community and and the most prevalent

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,959
most major operating systems

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
ship with some form of screen reader

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
like voice over on mac os

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,840
and narrator on windows but then there

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,160
are also third-party

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,840
uh options like jaws

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
and then there are even hardware

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,639
versions of screen readers like a

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,720
braille reader in the

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
shown in the lower right hand image

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,600
so now we have an idea of what it is but

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
why would we prioritize

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,759
web accessibility so

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,479
we should why should we care that we do

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
this work

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
alongside all the other work that we

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
might do here are a few reasons to

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
prioritize it

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,800
one is to minimize or mitigate risk

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
the section 508 of the americans with

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
disabilities act states that

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,960
federal agencies electronic and

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,800
information technology is accessible

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,120
to people with disabilities including

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
employees and members of the public

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,440
so building an accessible interface

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
ensures we minimize the risk of lawsuits

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
sort of like the one that target faced

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
and lost to the national federation of

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
the blind

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,759
when their website wasn't usable with a

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
screen reader

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
however i do not believe in lawsuit

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
driven development

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
so let's look at some other reasons we

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
might prioritize it

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
one is business reach limiting the

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
usability of your software limits the

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
reach of it

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,720
and therefore your business so if you

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,039
look at just these two statistics

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,960
about vision and colorblindness

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,479
there are only two statistics that are

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
u.s centric and

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
based on ancestry but that's a lot of

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
people that you would

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,560
uh be limiting access to

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
with your interfaces and therefore your

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759
business

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
so then and finally there's the stance

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,440
that it's the right thing to do

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
based on ethical and professional

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,880
standards

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,960
that's a tricky stance given it has real

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
impact on budgets and timelines and so

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
forth but i

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
i think the wider design and development

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
community

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
is going to continue to make it a higher

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
priority by default

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
in the future so hopefully it becomes a

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,000
given i see it

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
kind of like as security in software

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
systems it's slowly becoming more and

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
more of a default instead of an

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,919
afterthought

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
so how do we make sure that we're making

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
things

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,720
accessible on the web well there are two

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
sets of guidelines a designer or

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
developer can use in order to determine

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
either

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
how they should build a new user

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
interface or evaluate what they have

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
built for an existing interface we'll

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
spend more time

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,199
on the web content accessibility

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,680
guidelines or wikhag

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,759
as these apply to the widest range of

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
web applications and websites

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
atag the authoring tool accessibility

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
guidelines

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
applies to a specific class of web apps

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
those kinds of applications that

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
build web content such as content

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,800
management systems

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,680
html editors or other kinds of tools

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
so let's look a little bit at work the

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,479
wookhead guidelines

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,720
which is one of those funny acronyms

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,120
that people say like pin number

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,560
where you repeat the last letter again

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
those guidelines fall into four

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,039
categories that have the nifty acronym

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,039
of

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,440
poor p-o-u-r so it's it's too much to

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,680
fit into a short talk or one slide so if

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
you

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,120
google the quick ref for work cag it'll

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,160
have a really good

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,520
overview for uh each of these

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,919
but we will go over each of them in turn

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,479
at a high level

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
so perceivable information must be

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,919
perceivable

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,599
by the user for example an image that is

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,759
crucial to filling out a form that

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
doesn't have alternative text

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
means folks using screen readers will

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
never get the content needed to fill out

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
the form

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,360
that content is not perceivable to them

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
here's an example where we have a form

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,120
on the left hand side and

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
pretend that city is required that text

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
is actually in an

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
image but an image that doesn't have any

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,080
alternative text

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
so a user with a screen reader won't

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
actually know

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,360
that city is a required field and they

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,039
might fill out the entire form and then

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
submit it get an error and just decide

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,360
to bail

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,240
so that that requirement for that form

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,440
is not perceivable to them

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
operable interactive elements sorry

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,400
interactive elements have to be operable

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,039
by the user

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
for example here we have a button made

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,200
out of

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,959
a div element by default when you roll

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
your own ui elements like this

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,399
you have to code all the stuff that

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
normal html elements give

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,200
you for free keyboard focus handling

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,519
clicks key presses etc

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
in this case by default this button

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
doesn't receive focus from a keyboard so

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
users

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,519
that use only keyboards can't activate

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,800
it it's effectively inoperable to them

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,880
um funny slash sad side note

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
six connects appears to make all their

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
buttons out of divs

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,399
so um i would like to talk with the all

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,040
things open staff next year about

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,560
what we could do to maybe pick a more

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,040
accessible

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
platform

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,800
understandable information and operation

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,800
of the interface has to be

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,360
understandable to users

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,480
for example if a form doesn't identify

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
which fields

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
are in error when a user submits the

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
form users won't understand what is

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,560
wrong

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
and they won't know what needs to be

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
fixed in this case they have to guess

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
what is the error and it's not

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,160
understandable

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
and finally robust content must be

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
robust enough to work with a wide

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,880
variety of user agents

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,560
uh so in this example or for example

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
without the correct semantics

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,480
in markup some screen readers don't know

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
how to read the content

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
here we have some invalid markup that

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,920
represents a list

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,120
but using divs instead of list items so

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,880
it might render okay in a browser

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
but a screen reader won't know how to

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,600
parse this as a list

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,240
and would give unknown results for

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
screen reader user

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
so poor p-o-u-r represents the

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,160
high-level principles

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
in each of these principles we have many

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
granular guidelines we can't go into

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
every guideline now but we'll look at

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
some examples for the guidelines

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
of distinguishable which is inside of

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
perceivable

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
compliance with wilcag is measured in

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
levels a

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,839
double a and aaa each guideline is

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,160
associated with a particular level

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,880
and then so here's a guideline from each

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,279
level

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
and we'll go into each of these most

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,000
organizations strive for

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
adhering to level 2a so here's an

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
example

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,399
for the guideline for use of color level

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,320
a

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,320
we have two versions of a form with some

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
fields one of which is

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,519
marked one of the fields is marked as

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
optional but only through the color

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
green

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,839
the label nickname is optional on the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,240
left hand side

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,079
only using color to designate that so

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
colorblind users wouldn't actually know

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
it's an optional field

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
conversely you could think about it if

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,480
they were all required fields and only

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
use the

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
color to designate they were required a

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
colorblind user may not get that

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
information

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,600
so providing the word optional on the

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,600
right hand side

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,920
resolves this issue by providing

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,600
something other than the use of color

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,600
to say that a field is optional

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,839
here for the guideline of minimum

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
contrast we need a contrast ratio of at

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
least 4.5

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
to 1. and the text color that we the

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,880
color for the sample text

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,440
we have on the left is too low 2.84 to

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,600
1. so it fails for level 2a

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,760
but we tweak that color and we can bump

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
it up to 5.74

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,279
to 1 and it passes level 2a

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
now that may be good enough for the

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
organization's

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,920
standards that they're going for there

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,360
is another level for contrast

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,920
specifically

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
3a where the previous example would have

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
failed

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,760
at 5.741 to 1 but we

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,680
bumped the color up again or changed the

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
color to a different

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,839
something different that has a higher

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,320
contrast and now we have 12.63 to 1.

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,399
this would pass level 3a because it's

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
its threshold for passing is

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,519
7 to 1. so it

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,279
depends on the organization's um

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
what got what level the guidelines and

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,920
organizations trying to meet

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,800
but they some of them vary between a

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,200
double a and

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,360
aaa as to what you would have to do to

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
meet that requirement

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,519
so now we know what it is as far as web

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
accessibility goes

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,279
why we want to build it and have an idea

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
of how to measure but how do we actually

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
build

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800
web accessible web interfaces so i'll

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,920
touch on two topics in this section

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,760
aria and testing tools so again

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,680
not a lot of time to cover a bunch of

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,880
content but

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,040
check out the way area standards

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,279
guidelines for more information

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,639
there are a set of guidelines a set of

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,680
standards we can use

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,480
for building accessible web applications

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,240
these let us code our interfaces for use

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
by screen readers and other assistive

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,440
technologies

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,680
note though that one of its

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,959
recommendations is that you

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,240
if you can avoid using whey aria or arya

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,600
you should do so so many things work in

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,279
browsers out of the box

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,880
so to speak uh and we should be careful

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,560
if we start building our own stuff that

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,000
might not be compliant by default

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,920
sort of that example of

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
if you start building a button out of a

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,320
div you have to build it all the way

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
or we should just use a button

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,800
and then before during and after

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,880
development we'll want to test for

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,639
adherence to the woocag guidelines

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
so here are many tools that are

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,279
available to do that

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
so here there are some categories with

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,320
names and links to a few of them that

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
are out there

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
some are for manual evaluations like

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,760
color contrast checkers

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,880
and then others allow for some automated

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
evaluations like

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,800
web hint and accessibility insights

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
which i highly recommend

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
having used it on some projects in the

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,920
past browsers even come with some

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
built-in tools these days

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,120
for doing things like looking at the

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,839
accessibility

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,519
properties of elements axe is an

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
accessibility rule set that you can put

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,199
into your ci cd pipeline to evaluate

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
components before letting things go to

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,800
production

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,279
note though some research shows only

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,079
about 30 percent of

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,399
issues can be found in automated testing

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,120
so

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,600
manual evaluation is still a must

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,519
and finally this was a tour de force of

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
a quick presentation why stop learning

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
here

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
here there are many resources out there

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
from the international association of

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,480
accessibility professionals

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,279
to the standards themselves so i think

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,639
we

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,399
are right at time thank you very much

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
uh here's my contact info and it's in

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,839
the chat if you have any questions or

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
want to follow up
