Abstract: Web accessibility is a growing topic of interest among many practitioners in software development, from designers to product managers to developers. If you're not familiar with the topic it can be overwhelming at first. This talk serves as a crash course into web accessibility to help people get a grasp on the topic overall and figure out where they can go to learn more. It's useful for designers, developers, product managers, or anyone else involved in product development. Come learn about why accessibility is important, what all those acronyms mean (WCAG, ATAG, WAI-ARIA, oh my!), and about some of the tools of the trade.
