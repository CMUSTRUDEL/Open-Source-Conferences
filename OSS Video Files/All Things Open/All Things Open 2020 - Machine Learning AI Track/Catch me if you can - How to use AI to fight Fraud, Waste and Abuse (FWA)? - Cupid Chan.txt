Abstract: In order for a business to thrive, besides finding ways to increase the income, cutting down expanses is also important. In some industries like Insurance, Financial and Healthcare, “Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA)” are considered as one of the top expanses which costs companies billions of dollars. Traditionally, this is handled by a group of expert and investigator to identify potential fraudulent cases, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. With the rise of AI, there are more options to assist human to identify and prevent it from harming our community. This session will show not only “why” we should use AI to fight against FWA, but also the “how” it can be achieved practically by 3 major sections: (1) Supervised Learning: This part will explore how basic algorithm like decision tree, logistic regression and support vector machine can help in FWA and the corresponding result (2) Unsupervised Learning: This part builds on top of the previous section and will see how technique like clustering can complement the prior approach (3) Leveraging the latest finding of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): That part will investigate the use of GAN, which is used to be employed in image generation, on FWA and see how this more sophisticated model can help fighting FWA. The session will include real examples with open data of which audience can find online. We will also include latest researches in this area to strength the cases presenting here.

	00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
uh

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,920
as todd mentioned that my my name is

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,719
cooper chan and today's topic is about

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,679
how to use ai to fight for fraud ways

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,720
and abuse

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,080
and first of all let me introduce myself

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,760
besides i am the cto of a small company

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,920
names index analytics

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,080
i'm also the board of directors for

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,359
linux foundation odpi

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
and uh and so like linux foundation just

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,200
like the other

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,559
community open source community uh there

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,920
they have different projects and odpi

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,440
is the data arm of linux foundation

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,320
uh we we have projects about

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
binai which is actually the one that i'm

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
shared with

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,320
and also nigeria which is the related to

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,039
the mass metadata and also the open

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
data science for all it create a

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,960
curriculum so

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
that the the other university or

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
community college if they

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,799
don't have the resource they can

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,760
actually pull down the results from this

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,880
community

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
and try to teach ai and machine learning

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
data science

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
to to their student so those are the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,759
three main projects but

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
as we are talking now today we are

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,320
actually thinking to

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,759
combining with lfai which is the ai

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,640
community and uh in one of my

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
youtube channel you i explained that

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
data

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,400
is like the ingredients of cooking a

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,759
dish

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,560
while the uh the recipe

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,040
is the ai algorithm so i think this is a

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
very perfect match if we join this two

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,920
community together the

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,320
odpi and also lfai

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
so in the next few weeks or so you

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,399
should be able to see

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,479
some announcements from linux foundation

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,680
that these two communities are

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,960
joined force to create a bigger impact

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,000
on the analytics industry so

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,599
that's me but before i move on

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,440
let me give you this disclaimer

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,040

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,160
prepared or accomplished by cupid chan

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,520
in his personal capacity

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800

when i prepare this

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,640
or how to use ai to fight the front ways

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,319
and abuse

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,360

okay i am i have organization to

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,280
leverage data and use ai and analytics

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
so for example to prevent fraud ways and

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,159
abuse

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,799
oh interesting she replied and i would

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,280
like you to share with me some exclusive

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
exclusive about yourself and what do you

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,440
do in your industry

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,240
what like the potential you have and how

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,919
profitable it is and i'm seeking invest

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
in a private organization government

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
organization

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,639
and even individual that's why i am a

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,320
businesswoman and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,759
rated worldwide okay that really raised

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,720
some red flag

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,560
but you know what i again out of

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,919
courtesy i just asked

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,240
more clarification question my exclusive

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,000
what do you mean

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,440
her reply is very interesting her price

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,479
yes exactly so you know what that

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,080
really gives me a red flag

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,120
is this something that i should be aware

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,759
or she is legitimate

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
i will continue this linking story in

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
the

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
in later of this conversation or this

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120
conference talk

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,800
but back to the question back to the

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,919
title of this talk

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
is catch me if you can i am actually

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,160
inspired by a movie

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,520
so i know that we have the chance on

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,160
function enable so if you have

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,960
seen this movie maybe maybe you can uh

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,600
let me know

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,039
so that like i know if some of you have

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,199
already seen that you have some

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:40,400
background about about this so

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,400
let me see if i can see your chats

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,280
uh yeah i have some okay

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,440
so yep yep some yep and at least five

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,479
years i think it's even longer

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,600
yes this is this is the movie uh uh

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,280
like act by leonardo dicaprio

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,360
and of course in the movie it basically

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,039
is he is portrayed as um as a guy

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,720
who never went to the flight school but

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,199
he was a pilot and he never

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
went to a medical school but he can do

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,919
it as a doctor

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,360
and also he never went to a law school

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
but he also can do uh the job of a

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
lawyer

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,440
but of course as you know that in

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,360
as in any movie if you have a bad guy

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,720
here you will have a good guy the good

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
guy is tom hanks

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
he is the detective he is the police

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
trying to catch

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
new leonardo like uh his name actually

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
is

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,000
frank abernell and uh tom hank's name is

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,199
kyle in the movie

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,919
and they just tried to like give some

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
strategy how can i catch you and on the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,080
other side how can i

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,919
avoid you that makes me think okay

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,960
this is a very good topic because in ai

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,000
can we use the ai to really get this

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
kind of games

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
going on to catch broadways and abuse

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,919
but

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,639
before we move on we need to be very

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,080
clear

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,560
about what is fraud wins and abuse

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
so the definition is like that when

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
you're doing a fraud that means

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,120
there are laws here there are rules here

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
and you

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,759
intentionally try to break it

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,680
intentional

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,720
deception that's basically a fraud is

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,599
abuse is a little bit of blur

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
because it's not really you break the

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,440
rule

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,960
but you bend the rules so maybe you're

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,759
not breaking the law

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,560
but you're you're abusing the law to

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
give you

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,479
instead of like the flexibility or the

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,520
convenience

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,240
to the fellow citizens you

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
take the advantage of the law and ban it

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
test

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,120
abuse and when we go to waste

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
is even the the line it's even

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
not clear because when you think about

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
waste

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,039
uh you or some husbands may may say

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
the wife is like you you have only one

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,000
mouth

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,280
how come you can get like uh 50

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
different lipsticks

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,199
of different colors even if you have a

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,160
mouth one mouth only

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,080
it's a waist but on the other hand the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
the wife may also accuse

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,199
the husband is a waist you only have a

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
pair of hands

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,520
how come you can like keep purchasing

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,560
the game controllers right

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,599
so it's a little bit blurry but in

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,640
in summary anything that is

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,519
not used in efficiently like that's a

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
waste

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,880
error on the other hand is another level

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,000
lower

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,560
it's basically an intention

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,760
unintentional thought

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,360
for example if i type in my uh name

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,519
with a typo or like a day of day of

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,880
birth with a typo that is not

00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,080
intentional it's just simply an error

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,200
not really a fraud right so

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,720
if if you understand all this fraud ways

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,519
and abuse is actually

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
happen here in the real world you should

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,480
also know that

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,680
people are trying to get some way

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
to to get around all that so some some

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
say

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
like actually this is based on our

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
faults

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
last year there was a survey conducted

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,839
by

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
fox that majority of the companies or

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,839
organizations aware of that

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
and they have already done something for

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
example to do the

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,440
anomaly detection this is the blue line

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
here is something that

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,880
they have already done and the

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,399
yellow the yellow line here is something

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,360
that they plan

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,240
to adopt in the one uh one next one or

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,200
two years

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
as you can see here it the using

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,440
artificial intelligence on machine

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
learning

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,399
is actually one of the most popular one

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
that they plan to adopt here in the next

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,040
one or two years

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
so you know that this is something

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
coming up

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but let me ask you a question

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
you know that there are different forms

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
of

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
fraud ways interviews credit credit card

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
fraud

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
health care or just to steal your

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,519
identity

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,800
can you take a guess out of the three

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,320
which one cost us much like

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,680
the most money of all so like again

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
you can use the chat windows to provide

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,279
your answer

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
out of out of the three which one do you

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,959
think

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,240
is uh costing the most money

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,600
is that something that identity theft or

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,399
credit card fraud or health care

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
okay okay people are saying identity

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,440
theft okay

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,120
so healthcare let me review the answer

00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,120
the answer is healthcare fraud

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,040
it's 68 billion dollars per year

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,959
estimated and the credit card fraud rank

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,560
the second is 217.7 billion

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,640
and identity of of fraud

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,760
even though it's a lot of money but it's

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,880
only 1.7 billion dollars

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,839
so with that in mind within united

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,120
states

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,240
there is one organization that has

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,279
a lot of health care budget which is

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,560
cms center of medicare and medicaid

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,880
services

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:40,320
and just for the fiscal year of 2018

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,519
their budget is more than one trillion

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,800
dollars

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,920
with that and when i compare that to the

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,560
gdp

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,800
of the countries around the world it's

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,320
actually one agency

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,720
rank about 17 if you are compared to the

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,720
other country around the world

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:04,639
and no surprise because of that

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:08,160
so the bad guys are laying their eyes

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,120
on how to get some or portion of this

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,480
money

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,279
in their pocket so that's why back a few

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
years back

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,600
we do have some news from abc that

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
to be estimated approximately 60 billion

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
dollars

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,040
was like a used improv improperly

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
in front ways of or abuse so this is

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
actually

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,680
a big number a big amount of money

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
but when we think about the business

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,440
problem

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,480
we have it now how are we going to deal

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
with that

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
just like what i have mentioned in the

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,920
beginning of this conference

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,959
if you want to do the ai you need

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,399
both ingredient which is the data

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,160
and also the recipe which is the aips

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,639
but where are we going to find the data

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
if you think about this this kind of

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
data would not be

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,320
very easy to get people would not just

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,880
publish their proprietary proprietary

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
data

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,000
and saying that hey uh you know what

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,600
this kind of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,680
uh information you can use it as a fraud

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,920
but fortunately there are actually some

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,800
open data sets that's why this

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,720
conference is

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
all things open right not only the

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,519
algorithm is open the data

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,639
is also open for you to to adopt

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
and run your algorithm and one one data

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,360
set is

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,560
medicare provider utilization and

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,279
payment data

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
with the physician and other suppliers

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,320
that

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,040
here in the world in the website here i

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
listed

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,199
it's free for you to download and right

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,560
now they do have the data ranges from

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,680
2012 to 2017

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,480
and when i download all the data and i

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
list it out year by year you can

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,560
actually see that

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,279
there are a lot of features that i can

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,480
do

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,959
but the problem is the feature is not

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,399
the same across all the years

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,880
so some of them are actually missing out

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
in the other years so for example in

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,279
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,279
and 2013 the uh standard deviation are

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,959
there but they no longer

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,199
uh happens in 2014 to 2017.

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,600
and at the same time yeah when you look

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,839
at 2014 to 2017

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
there are some standard payments it's

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
there but

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,000
it back then in 2012 to 13

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,279
it's not there but when we are going to

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,360
train a model

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
we want something that can be more

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
standardized

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
not only standardized but at the same

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,320
time we want to pull the one that is

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,040
more meaningful to come up with as a

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
feature

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,040
for example you do not want to uh like

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
set the last name or first name as the

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,399
feature because

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,760
you know most of the time that would not

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,920
impact any

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,360
model that you're going to build so

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,560
that's why after

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
like uh analyze the data set these are

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,680
the

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
data or these are the features that we

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,720
are going

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,959
to pull out to do that initial analysis

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,240
if you look at this closer you will

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,480
notice that

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,240
all these features are good but it's

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
still missing something

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,680
that is which line here are fraud

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
hence we need to bring out another data

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
set

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,920
which is the list of excluded

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,320
individuals and entities

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,839
and it is published by the office of

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
inspector general

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,959
basically what it means is like after

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,000
like

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,600
years or months of investigation they

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,240
identify some persons those are the bad

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
guys

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,480
who are proven to be guilty in their

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
practice

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
so that's the reason why they list out

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,800
and publish this

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,680
list to on their website again you can

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,040
download it

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,839
and then by combining the mpi

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,320
which is the national provider

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:14,480
identifier with the previous data set

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,959
then i can identify who is the bad guy

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
and one thing that you need to like uh

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,240
take a look

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,880
closer look here is they are not only

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
published

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,399
who who are the bad guys but at the same

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,680
time

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,040
they also publish what kind of

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,600
terms that they violate and for how long

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,680
they need to be in this excluded list

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,199
for example in 1128

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,560
a they are just excluded for five years

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,759
that means if this same person

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,959
is going to conduct or charge

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,600
any medicare data any medic medicare

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
claims

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
within that five period of time of

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,040
obviously that would become

00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,399
a fraud fraudulent case

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,320
and when you are looking at this leia

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,240
database you will find out something

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
even more interesting because

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,799
even though they publish that data that

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,160
sets up data

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,760
not all the lines not all the rows

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,039
have an mpi in fact 90

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,600
of the mpi are missing so that actually

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,880
makes the combination the blending of

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,520
these two data sets

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
harder so we need to take a closer look

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,240
when we are trying to blend the data

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,960
and here is the algorithm here is the

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
logic

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
when we are trying to combine these two

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,679
uh two data sets

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,480
as i mentioned 2012 to 2017

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,760
those are the six years that we have the

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,960
data off

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
and then by the leie data set we know

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
that

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
from which day starting from which day

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
uh

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,400
this this person or this doctor or

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,760
provider

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,080
start to be excluded from

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,600
claiming or charging any medicare

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,280
medicare claims

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,840
and then at certain day this

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,559
period will end so we lock down this

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
period

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,240
but i do one more step i go back one

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,200
more year

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
because i feel like if you are being

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,240
accused or

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,440
being like verified proven duty in 2014

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,559
for example

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,760
so before 2014 let's say

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,320
a year of time you have already start

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,679
something that will make you to this

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,120
conclusion

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,320
so that's why between one year before

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
the extruder day

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,640
started to the final day that

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,400
exclusion ends i would consider that as

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
a fraud period

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,720
and then all the hectic schools meaning

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,240
that all the operations

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,280
and services provided by this provider

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,919
i consider that as fraud

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,200
so when i combine that together i come

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,720
up with this

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,400
final data structure all all the

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,120
features in the top five or eight

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
features

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,280
they are the features for that and the

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,000
last one is actually the label

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
that i deduced from the logic that i

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,440
explained it to you earlier in the

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,880
previous slide

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,360
now less the fun less the fun part

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,240
started because we are going to build a

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,200
model

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
using supervised learning but one thing

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,080
i want to tell you

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,559
based on my experience in ai i guarantee

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,080
you

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,200
i can build a model with 99

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,000
of accuracies so in

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,160
this conference i am exposing this

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,720
secret to you the very first time

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,360
how to build this 99 accuracy model

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
you know what is that i'm going to

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
predict

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,480
everything is not going to be a fraud

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,559
if you take a look at the confusion

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,840
matrix here

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
all the accuracy is based on the total

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,240
number of

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,640
observations and then the numerator is

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
the

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
total number of correct prediction that

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,919
i can make

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,799
that is the accuracy but

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
when you look at the total number of

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,960
observations that i have

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,159
right here it is actually 54 million

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,120
as the total number of uh cases

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,960
and all of them only four thousand six

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
hundred or four thousand seven hundreds

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,760
of them

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,120
so it's less than 0.008

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,159
like around 0.009 of that

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,679
so if i make my model to predict

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,640
everything and anything to be non-fraud

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
the accuracy of my model will be more

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
than 99

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
but it's just really something that you

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
want

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,039
i bet not right because you want to find

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,440
fraud

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,880
it doesn't matter whether how accurate

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,320
this model is

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
accuracy is not the only reason it's not

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,520
the only determination

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,480
why we need to build such model so

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,200
we come up with the problem and this

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,880
problem

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,760
is imbalance of the data we have a lot a

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,440
way lot

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,159
more of one class of the data versus the

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,960
other class

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,840
in this case we have a way more

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,520
non-fraud

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,240
normal data versus just a very tiny

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,679
portion

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,799
of the fraud data so how are we going to

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
deal with that

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,960
it's actually not really a abnormal

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,039
problem

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,640
credit card fraud or when you're

00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,400
manufacturing something the defect on

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
the on the product that you are trying

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,559
to

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,799
manufacture or some rare disease

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,120
when you try to diagnose some rare

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,039
disease or natural disaster

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,320
this actually of the very good scenarios

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,679
to reflect the discrimination

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,799
of the data of the minority class

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,159
but we do have some solutions to

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,600
to deal with that one is we

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
decrease the majority of that so in this

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,120
case

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,159
we can reduce the non-fraud cases

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,880
by using random undersampling that's one

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,600
one potential or a solution to deal with

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,080
that

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
and the other solution you can imagine

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,799
is to increase

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,520
the minority by maybe i just randomly

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,440
replicate the minority observation so

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,320
that when i train my model

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
that would be more a minority

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,440
representation for that

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,520
or i can synthesize i can produce

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,799
some synthetic minority or observations

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,000
to basically like complement

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,960
what i have in the majority group

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
so with these two approaches can you

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,760
guess

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
which one i should pick in this

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,159
particular situation

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,120
again feel free to use the chat windows

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
but i'm going to

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,600
review my secret to you the real

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,039
like a solution for this case is i'm

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,080
going to use the

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,440
random undersampling the rus

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,039
why because if you take a look at that

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,880
if i have already got 54 million

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,320
observations for the normal cases if i

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
expand my fraudulent case so that it

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,880
will be more balanced

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,880
that would be a huge amount of data for

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,320
me to go to take care of

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,120
so that's the reason why i tried not to

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
keep increasing the fraudulent case by

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,960
either replicated

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440
or trying to synthesize that fraudulent

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,120
case

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,000
but instead i cut down i trimmed down

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,799
the number of observations in the normal

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,279
cases

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,240
so that it would be more balanced or

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,159
like you may ask

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,000
like what would be the right proportion

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,760
it can be 50 50s 40

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,960
60 30 70 or 20 80. it doesn't matter

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,840
the the whole idea here is i want to

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,000
make sure that

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,360
when i provide the the training sample

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,400
for my model it will be at a point

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,799
that it will not be too biased or too

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
unbalanced of the data that you always

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,760
predict

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,880
the normal case is the predictive result

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,720
so i put everything together in

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
tensorflow i use tensorflow

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
uh to be more specific i use the boosted

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,440
tree classifier

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,320
and i use the 50 50 class distribution

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,360
for that

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,880
look at that the accuracy that i got

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,799
it's about 76 76

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:56,480
and the recall is 85 auc

00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:00,240
is 84 yes accuracy

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,480
is not as good as 99 which i predict

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,919
everything to be like a non-non-fraud

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,360
but 76 of the accuracy plus

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,159
uh precision precision about 70 percent

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
and the recall well 85 is actually

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,320
pretty good

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,559
or when we are considering the number of

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,240
sample that we have

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,960
but boosted tree classifier is not the

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,720
only

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,200
model that we have how about

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
the other models for example decision

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,039
tree

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,240
or logistic regression or support vector

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,760
machines those are

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,279
also very commonly used model

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,000
right so by this actually

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,039
some of the scholars in florida atlantic

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,400
university

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,360
have also done a very similar study

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,360
and what they did is they used different

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,400
learner or the model

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,679
to try to come up with different

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,159
score and you see the false negative and

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,360
false

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,120
positive rate for that as you can see

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:13,200
all of them all the like uh

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,159
uh of 4.5 decision tree actually are

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,640
the best model among all because they

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
have a

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,039
pretty decent auc rate and also very

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,120
relatively low false negative rate

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
but there is a caveat here uh they're

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
not using the foo

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,840
six years because uh when they did this

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,240
research

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,880
is like uh two to two or three years

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,559
back

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,679
so they don't have this um 2017

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,919
uh data so they only use the years

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,320
of 2012 to 2015 and contains

00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,440
approximately

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,480
37 million dollars versus uh

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,039
like a 54 millions as i use in my data

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
set

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,640
and also they did not use the looking

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,440
back one year

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
which i assume the activities when you

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
are going to

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,240
have a fraud in certain year one year

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
before that

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
you start doing something funky so

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,440
that's why i incorporate that

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,799
but in this study they did not include

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,240
that one year look back

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,880
but you can see the the whole idea of

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,159
this

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,200
and the result is pretty comparable to

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,159
what we have

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,080
found by using uh the approach that i

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,120
suggested to you earlier

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,840
all right so

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,520
what like when we are talking about a

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
fraud detection system

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,039
i think one thing that we need to be

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
sure is

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,640
we need to make sure that we are not

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,000
missing substantial number of the

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,520
fraudulent case which

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,159
again if i predict 99

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,279
of the cases on non-fraud which totally

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
missed this point

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,120
but on the other hand we do not want to

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,840
produce too many false positives

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,320
otherwise

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
it's otherwise it would be too too uh

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,720
annoying by

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,120
uh keep on pointing your finger

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
saying that hey this is a fraud so a

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
good balance would be

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,559
if you have a relatively low false

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,840
negative rate

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,799
and reasonably low false positive rate

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,120
it's actually pretty desirable and this

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,919
is

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,840
what like what we have already done in

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,440
this supervised learning

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,000
of course there are some potential um

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
improvement that we can do for this for

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,960
example

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,159
the geographic information in the

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,880
original data set

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,520
i dropped it i did not use it but in the

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,520
future

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,799
we may also want to take a look at the

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,320
geospatial or geographic information

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,120
also like i include a provider side of

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,960
the data

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,679
but how about the beneficiary the

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,240
patient side we did not have it so

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
in the future in a as a as an

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
improvement

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,720
so we can also incorporate that another

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,240
way to improve our model or

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,039
our ai algorithm even more is to have

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
more granular data by different times

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,120
takes code

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,120
but it actually depends if we only have

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,000
a small set of data

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
and if we even subdivide it into

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,399
different heat pick score or

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,200
operation that may or may not help for

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,200
the model

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,720
so we need to really test it out whether

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,000
we want to go

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,200
a more granular level or not and

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
of course we can also include more

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,320
metrics here to see whether we can

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,520
produce

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,120
more pre uh precise results and

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,480
finally remember that i also mentioned

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:44,320
in the leie database there are a lot of

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,360
more than 90 of the missing mpi data

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,159
but what if we can combine with another

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,000
data set let's say the mps registry

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:57,440
to boost up the to boost up the

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,320
mpi the missing mpi by matching up this

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
emphasis registry that actually would be

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,279
another way

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,720
to enhance the whole algorithm more

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,200
when we do that so

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,440
even though those improvements may

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,600
actually help out in the supervised

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,279
learning but there is still some

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,559
limitation that we need to take uh

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,960
will be aware of as the

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,720
as the nature of supervised learning is

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,520
you need to create a

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,039
attack or label along with each

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,240
observations

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,039
but remember that tagged data is not

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
always

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,159
available in fact we did not when i

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,679
introduced you for these two data sets

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,320
it's actually not there

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,279
we just try to correlate and create our

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,159
own test

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
but that may not be as accurate so tech

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,679
data

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,360
is not always to be available is one of

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,640
the limitations for supervised

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,279
learning and another one is when we

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,640
tag when we rely on the tech data it's

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
basically something happened

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
in the past but if you think about

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,919
anomaly or

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,720
some fraudulent cases usually those

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,559
bad guys are trying to create

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
innovatively and creatively

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
think about a new patent to cheat the

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,640
system

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,399
if we're relying on some historical data

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,880
on the tag data on

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,320
something in the past that may not be

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,360
sufficient enough

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,039
if we try to move on to detect the new

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,320
emerging trend

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,519
and that's the reason why another way of

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,640
unsupervised learning comes just like in

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,799
this diagram

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,840
if i don't tell you anything if i don't

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,039
tell you anything but

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,600
just through a bunch of paper clip

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,159
can you spot something of course your

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,200
answer

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,679
should be yes i can spot right here

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,320
this is the yellow paperclip i can

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,320
easily

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,000
observe of course on a diagram like that

00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,039
is pretty obvious in supervised learning

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,159
we are trying to transform

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,600
the data from something that is like

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,640
this which is very hard if i

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,320
ask you to spot where is

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
the uh anomaly or where is the outlier

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,919
of

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,720
this data set but in supervised learning

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,320
we basically

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,760
transform the data into something that

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,360
i can or the algorithm can spot the

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,559
outlier right here

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,200
in this case it's easier because i just

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,519
plot

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,559
one feature against the other the two

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,360
dimension

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,279
in a 2d graph then i can spot the

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,120
outlier right away

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,640
but what if i have something like this

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,360
we can then cluster use to unsupervise

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,399
the learning

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
to cluster different things and by by

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,200
coloring

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,039
different clusters or different

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,880
categories i can then

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,840
focus more on the one on the group

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,960
that that potentially have more

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,519
fraudulent case

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,320
or exceptional case compared to the

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,519
other

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,559
part of the population and

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,600
when i look at this i always think

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,960
of this picture

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,240
this picture when i see it i do not know

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,640
what is that but please pay attention to

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,960
the next 30 seconds

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,559
this may look like just a jumble of old

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,799
painted plastic and wire

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,480
but when you take a step back you see it

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,120
for what it really is

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,600
a remarkable sculpture suspended in

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,880
mid-air

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,799
yes i when i uh saw this youtube

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,919
video i immediately linked this back

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,880
to unsupervised learning sometimes

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,320
when you look at the data it's just

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,640
scattering around

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,440
you don't have a way or you have a clue

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,919
what is that

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,559
what is the pattern what is the anomaly

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,159
and how am i going to categorize them

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:06,640
but the beauty for super unsupervised

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,079
learning is i don't need to tell you i

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,560
do not need to tell you

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,280
what to look for you just maybe step

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,159
back

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,280
step forward or looking at from the

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,639
other angle

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,200
and then immediately or after a while

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,320
you will be able to spot the pattern

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,359
this pattern

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,399
at certain angle in certain line at

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:31,119
a level and then spot at certain things

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,560
you will see that pattern start to

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,320
emerge

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,760
and here in unsupervised learning a more

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,480
like a mathematical way is there are two

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,359
approaches

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,079
for more statistical mathematical way to

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,960
define

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,560
and supervise the learning in a.i in

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,159
this particular case

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,440
as you can see in my uh screen there are

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,399
of two groups of blue dots here but

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,839
there are

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,880
three dots p1p2 and p3 here

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,480
using your chat function tell me which

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,359
one do you think it's called outlier or

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,359
a normally

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,320
in this case okay so you can say p1 p2

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,520
or p3

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,280
if you are the one that is trying

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,400
that they're trying to categorize p1 p2

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,839
or p3

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,480
which one do you think is an outlier for

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,680
that

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
okay someone answered it okay p1 of

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,599
course

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,880
yep a lot of people are saying p1 good

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,920
good but actually p1

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,119
is a very uh very good answer

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,079
by using nearest neighbor approach this

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,119
what this approach

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,560
is by measuring the distance

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,560
the distance between the closest point

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
of that when you're measuring the

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,079
distance of this

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,200
you know the the closest point is here

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,320
is relatively

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
relatively short compared to p1 right

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,119
here right

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:07,599
so obviously p1 will be considered as

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,640
outlier but when you are using another

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,040
approach

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:16,640
density based approach it's by density

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,280
both p1 and p2 are also

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,839
cons can be considered as an outlier

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,720
because

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,760
you can see that everything here are

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,520
very close

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,160
but p2 are just like not as close not as

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,400
dense compared to the other blue dot but

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,520
when you look at p3

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,880
the the distance even though it's it's

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,599
uh not as good but the density

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,599
it's actually pretty uh similar to the

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,880
other blue dot here so

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,240
p3 here can also consider as part of

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,079
this cluster

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,960
p1 obviously it's very non-dense

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,359
in in this position so that's the reason

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
why

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,560
depending on whether you're using

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,599
nearest neighbor

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,960
and n or when you're using uh

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,839
density so that will basically con

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,480
a different approach we can consider as

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,760
different things for you to get the

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,440
uh unsupervised learning as an

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:21,280
anomaly right so now

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,920
let's come to the very last approach

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,359
that i want to talk to you in this in

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,240
this conference

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,839
but i also want you to use the chat

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,320
windows to tell me

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,320
this person this person you must know

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,599
her in order to understand the third

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,359
approach

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,440
who is she a is she committed a 100

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,680
million fraud in european bank

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,280
last year by just guessing an immediate

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,320
password using an ai

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,880
algorithm a b is like

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,960
she is actually a man just in disguise

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,920
to fool the airport security to

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,560
smuggling

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,520
five kilogram of drug in united states

00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,920
last year

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,880
and see she is actually the person

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,480
inventing this

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,079
third approach that i'm going to

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,400
introduce so

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
use your chat windows and see whether

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,960
you can

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,640
uh guess who is this person all right

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,079
so i got some answer coming in

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,839
and most of them are c and some say

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,680
all three and the answer is

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,760
actually none of them none of them

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,520
this person i said it's related to

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,599
or this third approach but

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,760
she is actually thick she is produced

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,960
by an approach that i'm going to

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,040
introduce called

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:49,040
gang generative adversarial networks

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,320
so in this network what happened is

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,359
a generator is trying to learn some real

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,560
samples

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,359
from real world and then try to generate

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,240
some fake

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:01,200
sample so that the discriminator is

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,720
trying to guess

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,839
whether is this uh is this a real sample

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,640
or is this something from generator

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,480
if the result is coming back the

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,720
discriminator is correct

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,079
then the discriminator will be kept but

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,280
the generator would

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,000
pick up this clue to improve its skill

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,000
to fake

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,359
more samples on the other hand if the

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,440
discriminator is incorrect then it will

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,520
also pick up the clue so next time it

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,560
will know oh this kind of

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,200
sample is actually fake when we apply

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,119
this

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:43,040
to like uh producing a fake image

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,760
we can provide a lot of the real general

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,320
genuine image to the generator so the

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,359
generator keep on producing this

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,240
so that the the picture that you saw

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,960
in the previous slide this that lady

00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,079
here

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,280
it's actually a result of gang the

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,800
generative

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,359
adversarial network uh algorithm

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,079
so in real world we're actually doing

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,359
this

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,480
by uh getting that healthy

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,560
data set so that the gang will keep on

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,880
learning and try to understand

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,839
what is good and what is bad and then by

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,720
the time

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,839
when the real fat like in this case a

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,640
cancer cells

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,119
comes in then it will detect immediately

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,079
because

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,280
it knows what is good and what is that

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
but you may ask

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,640
hey cupid hold on one second i think

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,680
this topic

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,640
is about how to use ai to fight for

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,000
fraud ways and abuse why you suddenly

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,079
change the topic

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,079
for image like or production or just

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:51,280
image reproduction for that

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,520
yes look at this if i change

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,880
the generator and the discriminate

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,920
discriminator

00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,880
to leonardo and tom hanks here

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,160
and then if i change the image to

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,359
something like the

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,920
maybe the correct or normal healthcare

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,119
fraud data but but without fraud

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,079
and then the the fuller or the generator

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,520
which trying to generate some sample so

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,000
that the

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,839
discriminator will try to detect whether

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,040
it's a fake or real

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,839
then this model it's actually a very

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,280
good model

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,640
to detect whether the data coming in is

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,599
fraud or not fraud and if i plot it

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,480
graphically

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,440
this is actually the graphic the blue

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,640
cross here

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,480
is the real genuine data with with no

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,079
fraud and i got the five minutes uh

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,760
alert thank you very much and i'm going

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,880
to wrap it up and uh

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,240
here when in the generic

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,000
uh a way of having all this data

00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:00,240
to to pretend i am the the real data

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,760
the or the orange triangle is going to

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,640
do this trying to fool the discriminator

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,680
so that when it comes becoming better

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,400
and better

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,160
the discriminator the the generator will

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,839
try to produce the

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,599
orange triangle and at the same time the

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,760
discriminator will try to distinguish

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,800
between the good and the bad but there

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,240
is a problem

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,119
the problem here is when the generator

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,400
or the fula

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,440
becomes so good that it produces more

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,880
and more

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,520
orange triangle the the fake

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,880
sample around this area the

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,720
discriminator will

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,920
no longer be able to distinguish that

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,640
so that's the reason why we need another

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,680
way

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,720
which is actually one of the study of

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,119
ocan one class adversarial nets by these

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,200
five

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,800
scholars so what they're doing is

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,359
instead of faking

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,640
the real thing right here they are

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,079
faking the gap

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,839
right here so that the the discriminator

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,240
will try to distinguish

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,960
whether this is the gap or this is

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,640
something

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,440
real for for the from the real data set

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,240
that's the complementary game that will

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,839
help out

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,720
to distinguish between the fraud and the

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,319
and the true data and in fact by using

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,119
this architecture

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,640
the the approach and the results are

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,280
very sounding

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,720
they they detect a lot more than the

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,440
traditional gang

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,000
to distinguish whether this is a fraud

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,760
case

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,079
versus this is not and uh i understand

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,040
that uh we i don't have much time left

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,160
so i want to give you the uh advantage

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,359
of the one class

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,920
adversarial net or the one can it is

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,400
you do not need much fraud data you

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,480
actually

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,640
do you don't need the fraud data to

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,640
start with which in the supervised

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,200
learning that i showed you before we

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,319
spend some time to do the class balance

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,880
and at the same time discriminator here

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,480
can be more efficient because it's not

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,000
trying to distinguish

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,119
between the real data and the fake it

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,440
uh or normal data it's trying to

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,480
differentiate the real data

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,800
from the generated malicious data so

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,400
it's more efficient efficient that way

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,160
and for this model it adapts much better

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,720
to the emerging normal data user pattern

00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,760
and this is also the the advantage of

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,200
the one class

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,599
uh adversarial net and

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,599
in the very last minute let me continue

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,560
this linking story

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,760
uh i decided to use or ask my most

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,880
knowledgeable friend

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,119
uh google to look up this jacqueline

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,079
and i find out that yes this is a real

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,520
person but

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,720
she is 80 years old now and i'm afraid

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,599
this is actually not a real person

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,680
or jacqueline that that email me so the

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,200
conversation continued

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:08,960
and then i just try to

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,240
pro brush her off by copy and paste

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,760
some of my linking profile to answer

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:20,000
her question and the very last thing

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:23,599
of her reply is saying wow cool

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,960
one minute later after she replied this

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,839
and when i click on her profile i got

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,800
this

00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,319
this profile is not available i swear i

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,040
did not report her

00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,760
but i think maybe linkedin is also using

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,359
some

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,000
uh ai algorithm to detect this

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,640
person is not the the the real

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,280
jacqueline moss that is talking to me

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,480
but at the same time maybe someone just

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,520
report and linking

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,400
took the action and if you

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,760
are not convinced ai if you're still not

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,720
convinced ai

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,839
is the right way to do like a fraud ways

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,200
and abuse

00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:07,680
at least one thing i want to tell you

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,480
that is for the character that leonardo

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,280
plays

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,319
frank abernal he is actually a real

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,880
person

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,720
and but at the end of the story and you

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,000
will know that as well

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:24,880
he became fbi and serving uh

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:29,040
in fbi agent for more than 40 years

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,760
the the whole story and the goal behind

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,640
why i'm telling you this is not all the

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,760
bad guy

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,400
has the opportunity to turn it to a good

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,800
guy

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:44,160
and help us to fight for ways and abuse

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,720
if you are not doing that yes we know

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,119
that

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,760
we are talking about a topic of how to

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,319
use ai to fight fraud ways and abuse

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,040
but remember on the other side of the

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,839
world

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,040
then maybe another conference holding on

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,079
right now

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,440
to talk about how to use ai to conduct

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,560
fraud ways and abuse by some person

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,319
if we are not going to adopt it your

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,839
competitor will

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,800
and that's all uh i want to talk about

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,119
this today

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,599
and i know i'm running out of the time

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,680
but uh please knock down my linkedin and

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,280
also my youtube channel here because

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,240
it's my goal to like uh clean up all my

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,559
code here

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,800
in this talk and open source it in my

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,319
github and also in my youtube channel

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,800
so that you have you can have the

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,760
hands-on on all the source code here and

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,079
how did i do

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,960
this supervised and unsupervised and

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,960
also gain

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:46,240
our network in fighting the broad ways

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,240
