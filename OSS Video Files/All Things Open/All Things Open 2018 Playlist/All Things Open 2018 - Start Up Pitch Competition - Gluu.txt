Thank You aide thank you everyone for

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,880
coming

00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:11,370
so I'm Mike Schwartz i'm the founder of

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,130
glue and i'm also the host of a podcast

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,420
called open source underdogs com

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,920
so if you're starting a software

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,050
business you might want to listen to

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,410
that at some great advice from leaders

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,820
in the open source industry so I don't

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,830
want you to leave this presentation

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
without understanding what the heck glue

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,970
does so let me just start with like the

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,210
real basic like explanation

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,469
if you've ever logged into a website

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,770
you've put in a username and password

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,300
and that's called authentication so

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,850
that's that really the heart of what

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,730
glue software does if you have a lot of

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,980
websites you know tens or hundreds and

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,070
each of those websites implements its

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,840
own way to authenticate users you'll

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,059
have a lot of duplicated code you'll

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,000
have worse security or worse scalability

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,980
so glue is a server that allows one

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,770
place to centralize user authentication

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,790
and allows all of these applications out

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,860
there to centralize the this central

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,229
authentication service after we know who

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,930
you are we might want to make policies

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,720
like based upon who you are what can you

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,060
do which API is can you call which

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,070
websites can you visit what data can you

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,710
access that's called policy management

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,140
or authorization so you're probably

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,360
thinking well there must be a lot of

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,070
companies out there that do this and

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,380
you'd be right about that

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,540
this is an old problem you know dating

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,900
back you know since computers weren't

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,119
done did so at first glance it seems

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,740
like a very competitive market you know

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,799
we look at the market into three

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,299
segments there are SAS companies for

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,700
example octa even Microsoft has a

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,860
service called Azure ad

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,170
Google identity Oracle has a south

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,560
service so there's lots of there's the

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,560
SAS market is one segment for companies

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,179
that want to deploy the software on Prem

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,849
the there's Oracle IBM CA and there's

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,240
also a ping identity in Ford Rock so

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,120
there's a

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,370
of commercial on-prem vendors but in the

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
open-source on-prem market there's

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,570
really only three vendors there's

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,880
ourselves there is Red Hat has a product

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,940
and there's a company called wso - and

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,950
within that open source segment glue is

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,750
one of the technical leaders and with

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,900
two thousand downloads per month we also

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,690
see wide adoption of glue you know

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,630
globally a glues maybe not exactly a

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,360
startup we've been around since 2009 so

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:46,950
going on 10 years this year so we have a

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:52,200
pretty wide install base and and lots of

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,270
users so there are other companies out

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,330
there some who have exited so we can get

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,820
an idea about valuations so ping

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,680
identity and Ford rock are the two

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,570
companies we compete with you know most

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,210
frequently and we have an idea of their

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,510
valuations ping recently sold to private

00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:13,350
equity at 600 million I think that was a

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,110
pretty good deal for Visa Visa equity in

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,200
the South market companies are valued

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,810
even more even more highly so duo was

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,560
acquired for 2.3 billion dollars

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,450
Octus also is a huge market valuation so

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,860
this is a really big opportunities and

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:34,170
these companies are valued really highly

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,670
the Gloup Gloup is a platform it's not

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,650
just you know one single piece of

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,100
software and that platform includes

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,510
server software client software

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,110
two-factor authentication software an

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,120
api gateway without bragging about all

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,670
the great customers we have glue is

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,670
serving federal governments around the

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,550
world telcos financial institutions

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,820
healthcare consumer facing so we have a

00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:04,920
pretty broad adoption of customers using

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,590
the product so ten years is a long time

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,620
why are what's changing like what now

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,930
that we think that we can put glue on a

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,720
better growth scale and what I'd say is

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,060
well we've two years ago we made a

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,000
commitment to move to open core business

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,520
model open core is where you have

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,319
certain parts of the

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,470
product are free in certain parts you

00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,210
charge for that pivot took some effort

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,879
it's easier said than done

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,139
to release new products you know in our

00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,629
industry where everything's

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,580
mission-critical and highly secured it

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,099
takes us a while but we've completed

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,740
that pivot and at this point we feel

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:45,190
like in 2019 we're ready to really

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:49,430
execute on the open core model and

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,050
really achieve a higher growth rate so

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,729
the question with open core is always

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,449
like what do you charge for and what do

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:56,180
you give away

00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:58,190
so certainly compliance and audit

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,289
features are something that enterprises

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,720
are willing to pay for some high-end

00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:04,639
security features that we know like only

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,710
banks and finance companies want we're

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,419
gonna charge for that and some extra

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,400
bells and whistles which are not exactly

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,740
core but they're nice to haves and some

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,930
companies want them we're currently

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,300
doing a million and a half in recurring

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,880
revenues and we're projecting you 50%

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,479
growth so there's the hockey stick

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,750
everyone wants we're trying to raise a

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,870
series a right now mostly to invest in

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,520
in sales and marketing and increase not

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,130
just our market share but our wallet

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,520
share so yes well we want to get more

00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,860
customers but by upselling our existing

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,039
customer base we think we can capture

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,930
more revenue per customer and that will

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,539
also help us get on a faster growth rate

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:58,120
so I'm gonna give back a minute 15 for

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:58,120
questions please give it up for glue

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,900
and now glue has about five minutes for

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,470
QA from our panel of judges a few quick

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,740
questions have you raised capital before

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,990
[Music]

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,270
why go straight to series a right now

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,400
depending on the answer to the first

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,900
question and the third question is how

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,540
is the open core pivot kind of unfolding

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,190
it's definitely a transition but I

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,930
wasn't clear on what you were doing

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,250
before was it just support services and

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,140
then you were open sourcing additional

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,940
things or sorry sprinkled a few

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,820
questions a lot of questions yeah so we

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,610
were selling support primarily that was

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,410
the business model and and and also

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,450
building the software glue is a big

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,090
complicated product and it just took a

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,550
long time to build a product yeah we

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,430
have been bootstrapping the company we

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,010
are fortunate in that we had a very

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,340
supportive community and we had time to

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,830
develop it why go to a series a we feel

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,280
like well after 10 years we have some

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,350
initial investors some small investors

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,290
that we want to recapitalize and cash

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,030
out and we're not attached or whatever

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,240
we call you know would call a funding

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,800
round but series a seemed right cool I

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,810
had one question with forgerock actually

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,640
sorry for asking all these questions I

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,140
think they have a few off offends II

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,320
projects that are open source is that my

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,210
anti corrector so for Drock it's a good

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,270
example of how an open source company

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,550
can go you know sort of fall off the

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,280
edge the original mission was open

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,110
source but after raising about 150

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,590
million dollars open source went out the

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,140
window

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,410
so now they said that they're going to

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,240
open source certain older versions but

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,170
it's not clear if that'll ever happen at

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,210
this point they're just straight

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:53,860
commercial offering got it cool relative

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,440
to the competition that you acknowledged

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,690
which is you know obviously very

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,960
well-funded and and has a lot of

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,330
traction in the market what why would I

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,220
buy your product instead of theirs

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,470
outside of the fact that it's open

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,700
source I mean that it will be

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,260
interesting to me but

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,600
may not be critical to me in a buying

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,670
decision what is it that's you know

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,500
really driving the buying decision ahead

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,780
of some of these other guys up there

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,730
yeah customers don't necessarily care

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,070
about open source some do there are

00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,580
three reasons why people buy glue um one

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,100
is is that our we don't have per user

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,770
pricing on the core server so if you

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,840
have if you're a country and you do per

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,090
user pricing that's actually a tax on

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,160
citizens so I think that there's a

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,169
certain consumer facing applications the

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,150
business model of per user pricing which

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,560
is what our competitors use doesn't fit

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,930
for a lot of large consumer facing

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,260
applications so that's one use case

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,300
really paranoid customers who like the

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,670
transparency open sources some of the

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,770
federal government or military

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,920
applications they like the transparency

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:02,410
of the open source and the third reason

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,270
is product I tzer's we have a number of

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,890
companies where the glue server is

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,900
actually a part of their product and

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,700
they need the IP to be clear in order

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:13,840
for them to deliver their service or

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,820
product generally no I mean I'm biased I

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,160
think the glue server open-source

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,650
development has been a great development

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,810
methodology for us and we've seen that

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,860
the products just better it's more

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,260
innovative

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,270
we're quicker to get to market and we've

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,760
leveraged the ability to incorporate

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,890
open source products or really develop

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,700
deliver or more flexible just a better

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,740
product so one follow up the customers

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,270
that buy your stuff are you winning them

00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
away from one of the competitors you

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,100
listed generally or is it mostly

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,750
greenfield customers that are you know

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,300
either in your pipeline are currently

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,580
buying you on almost every so our

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,370
customers are mostly large organizations

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,960
and they're all looking at the

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,760
commercial offerings and we compete with

00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,430
ping or Ford Rock and almost every deal

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,710
and actually price isn't a huge issue

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,390
for them they got plenty of money so

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,580
it's really about choosing the best

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,510
technology so we have to go head-to-head

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,330
on the technology and on the roadmap and

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,300
the price is not normally a huge driver

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,770
in the

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,850
decision you're not gonna sacrifice

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,950
security to save a couple bucks

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,800
so I have a comment in a question we had

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,100
the pleasure of looking at your slide

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,820
deck before as we came in into this

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,030
event so I saw on one slide that your

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,330
plan was to capture 80% market share and

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:40,940
that kind of raised the flag because

00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,830
it's a big number and unless you have a

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,590
monopoly in your electric companies I

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,930
don't think I remember that slide

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:51,050
actually so the market for companies

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,550
that need to authenticate users is every

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,030
organization in the world

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,750
every nonprofit every business every you

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,550
know even Church or soccer team needs so

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,770
no company in this this is a highly

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,980
fragmented market and the great thing is

00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,810
about is that it's a huge market but no

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,030
company's gonna get eighty percent right

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,130
not even my check that just because

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,790
maybe I misinterpreted it yeah and so

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,770
the second thing and I could be way off

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,830
with this but how do you see the

00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,640
blockchain functionality impacting what

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,400
you're doing today

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,320
so as an entrepreneur I think it's

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,690
always important to be in the market

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,000
that's expanding right now not in the

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,610
adjacent market adjacent possible is a

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,490
very bad place for entrepreneurs and so

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,220
the market that we're in right now is

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,800
exploding two-factor authentication and

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,590
API security central authentication and

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,070
Federation the tons of demand block

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:51,260
chains in adjacent possible where we see

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,760
some interesting applications but that's

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,160
for the next entrepreneurs that's for

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,030
you guys but glue is focusing on what we

00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,200
can make money on today but why today

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:06,980
the right time for you to raise money

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:10,040
versus a year from now or last year you

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:14,360
know what is it that you're driving the

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,120
market today for you to raise money park

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,279
it part of it is just so we have we're

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,499
doing some corporate restructuring of

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,319
and we want to cash out some investors

00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:27,149
who are holding some debt and part of it

00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:30,480
is that we feel like the product is

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:33,269
stable enough and that the market is out

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,029
the 2fa adoption is in the right place

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,949
and we feel constrained by capital and

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:39,629
that by adding a little more gas in the

00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,490
tank at this point that we could

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:43,499
actually use that effectively I think

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,089
the other thing is is that we have the

00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:46,889
right business model right now it took

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,009
us a while to put ourselves in a

00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:52,139
position where we could leverage a

00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,610
license model on a certain portion to

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,189
achieve the type of growth that we need

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:59,430
to really justify putting that external

00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:00,930
money to work all right ladies and

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,519
gentlemen please give it up for our

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,089
second presenter in the startup pitch

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,089
