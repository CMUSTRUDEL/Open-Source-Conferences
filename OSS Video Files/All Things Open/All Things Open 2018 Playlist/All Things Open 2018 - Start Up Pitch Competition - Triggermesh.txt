00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:12,360
hi there I'm mark Hinkel I am the

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,460
co-founder of trigger mesh and we are a

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,199
server list management platform hmm so

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,789
how many people here today are going to

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:27,449
occur Burnie DS containers

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:29,580
hey Jas talk serverless

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,560
is the implies that there's a lack of

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,520
server technology and we're talking

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,710
about things like Amazon lambda Google

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,440
cloud or cloud functions and things like

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,960
that the technology that we're basing

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,600
our products on is kubernetes which is

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,700
the new cloud fabric for container

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
management and scheduling and the

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,360
serverless extension is part of that

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,329
project championed by Google is called

00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:00,780
Kay native but what we do is we create

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:03,210
an amazon lambda clone so it is a server

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,750
list technology that runs on the cloud

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,260
or on-premise to allow you to deliver

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,420
functions as a service the thing that

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,670
makes trigger mesh unique and different

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,310
is that we provide portability across

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,710
all clouds so we give you the ability to

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,560
pull your server serverless functions

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,939
and publish them to Google Amazon or on

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,220
Terra and cloud and I'll talk a little

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,670
bit about why that is interesting in a

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,740
bit one of the things that we will add

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,509
to our product that will grow with our

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,549
product is a library of triggers and

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,799
triggers are those events in the cloud

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,610
that allow you to pool functions so for

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,680
example when you call uber for a ride it

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,869
does a lookup of the drivers in your

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,909
area that's a function that it looks up

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,640
and it does a func lookup of your

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,439
account information to see what your

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,729
background is what your rating is and if

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,380
you have a valid port form of

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,360
information or payment trigger mesh is

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,390
developed by a bunch of guys who've been

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,790
doing cloud software for many years

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,759
we've worked on the Xen hypervisor no

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,370
js' cumulus is a leading serverless

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:18,110
framework already apache cloud stack and

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:21,680
openstack so our strategy is this

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,849
puberty DS and k native is the

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,549
technology that we think is going to

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,650
provide the server lists mesh for all

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,260
clouds in the future and it's being

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,180
driven largely by a consortium of users

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,700
in the cloud native computing foundation

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,860
as well as Google which is driving K

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,909
native as their serverless plug into

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,709
that framework we are open source guys

00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:46,170
all of us have contributed significantly

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,329
to open source we plan to contribute to

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,359
the upstream packages and kubernetes and

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:53,970
key native as well as as appropriate

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:57,329
we'll open source technology that speeds

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,090
adoption but our our core product from

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:05,250
day one is a SAS offering and a

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:08,909
proprietary software package the thus

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,920
fast offering allows us to actually see

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,379
what these development patterns and

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,470
usage patterns are and actually address

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,329
and add features very quickly the on

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,829
premise will mirror those features and

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,019
functions but we feel like the SAS

00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,239
offering a is important because that's

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,549
the way cloud consumers are consuming

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,079
software and B it does give us the

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,730
ability to move quickly

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,530
now there's two terminologies around

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,389
serverless service implies there are no

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,180
servers and we when we say serverless we

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:42,199
mean Amazon lambda we need Google Cloud

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,269
functions and as your cloud functions

00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,340
functions as a service or faz indicates

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,099
that there is that same computing

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,549
paradigm but you are developing that

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:59,370
software via our managing on-premise

00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:02,010
with your servers our initial software

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,720
has has a few features that are we

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,829
believe critical and make it saleable

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,230
and over time we're going to increment

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:12,000
Illya dies rather than do big product

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:14,849
releases so a little bit about the team

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,370
my co-founder Sebastian Gibbs Guang is a

00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,760
PhD in Comp Sci he's one of the leading

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,770
experts in kubernetes he's been a cloud

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,699
architect for numerous

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,740
these bitNami citrix he is the developer

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,830
of qibla switch the new stack has

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,849
recently named as the most popular open

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,819
source service framework are actually

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:42,520
service framework period we have

00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:45,069
background as as open source committers

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,009
as i've mentioned and he's a published

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:51,400
and respected author in the space myself

00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:53,590
I recently ran the naejay s Foundation

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,530
which is probably the world's most

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,539
popular service technology number one

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,300
workload and initial workload for Amazon

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:02,949
lambda for pivotal z' clout I was number

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,729
two when pivotal is cloud and number one

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:09,130
in Google etc and IBM's open wisk cloud

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:12,400
are now cloud functions and I have a

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,159
background in taking products to market

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,919
and having successful exits before that

00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:19,210
I was the VP at cloud comm which was

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,060
acquired by Citrix for three hundred

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,919
million dollars

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,720
zena's was another company that started

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,400
with four hundred thousand in revenue

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,919
and ended up at twenty million in

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,659
revenue and open source management we

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,370
also have five contractors around the

00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:38,740
globe in a nutshell this is what cert

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,500
what trigger mesh does it publishes a

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,180
function from source control to our

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,159
cloud then it can be pushed out to

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,500
Amazon or Google or it can be executed

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,389
in our cloud with Amazon lint just as it

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,340
would be an Amazon lambda and take

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:53,919
advantage of serve of our trigger

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,590
library which are going to kick off

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,400
those functions and allow you to consume

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,400
these functions repetitively across our

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,789
install base or reuse them in your in

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:11,080
your in cloud on-premise or in Amazon or

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:13,090
Google cloud functions just this is the

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,349
obligatory we do have a product but we

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,020
don't have enough time to do a demo

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:19,300
slide so we started working on this in

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,599
July we have this deployed and we're

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,259
working on deployments throughout a few

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,330
of our customers right now because of

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,909
time constraints I'm going to

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,009
switch through to a little bit about

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,610
where we are and where we're gonna go so

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:38,710
right now we are seeking funding we have

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,319
our minimal Viable Product out right now

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,240
we will launch our company publicly in

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,120
two weeks on Halloween or next week on

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,610
Halloween we want to get to our 1.8

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,620
product launch in March and then

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:56,050
accelerate our customer acquisition and

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,580
then we have a channel go to market so

00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,740
last month we actually officially

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,110
incorporated with our first three weeks

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,330
we closed their first deal it's 170 km

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,840
bookings we have our second customer

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,960
right now which is sa P we're talking to

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,409
quite a few other companies mainly their

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,960
strategic and funding our development as

00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:20,860
well as something that we can insert

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,279
into our product and that's pretty much

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,870
where we're at right now we are seeking

00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,469
funding we're seeking funding to get to

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,830
our 100 product which we we're very

00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:34,000
confident will come out in March and

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,400
based on our product launch in the next

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,020
couple weeks it may change our plans we

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,750
have a we anticipate a very good amount

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,610
of Industry feedback and we think we're

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,330
gonna get a lot of inbound everything so

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:55,500
far has just been quiet word-of-mouth so

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,900
we feel like the tide is going to turn

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,270
as soon as we launch one Halloween so

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,250
that is pretty much us and thank you

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,610
ladies gentlemen big hand for trigger

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,610
mass

00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,580
last time for our panel of judges

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:16,600
suppose their questions to mark about

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:19,360
trigger mesh so why now the right time

00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,240
for the product you know why wasn't

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,580
right a year ago or why would not be

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,970
right for years from now there's there's

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,419
two things number one this is kubernetes

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,760
Inc is one of the first technologies

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,380
that has been a that we feel like will

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,240
be adopted across the cloud there are

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,709
other precedents things like OpenStack

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,810
and such which was not nearly as

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:47,140
democratized or developed across the

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:49,270
whole industry number two is the the

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,970
evolution of cloud computing into the

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,899
serverless space and specifically we see

00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:00,010
more and more event-driven programming

00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:01,510
happening that is driving not as a total

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,580
revenue number but as a percent of

00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,209
growth in the cloud space is serverless

00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,640
and there's a lot of desire for people

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:12,610
to consume server lists on multiple

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,260
clouds so we're cross cloud preventing

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,770
the lock-in as this industry grows

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,700
thanks mark

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:25,420
um with github coming on as your first

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,630
customer but they come on let's get lab

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,820
Oh get lab ah okay they're still there

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,450
the number two in there okay sure

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:38,110
did they come on before your MVP was

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,650
developing if they did what shift will

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,570
you have an MVP afterwards so they came

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,650
on as we were developing our MVP and

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,660
actually the reason they were such a

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,790
good match is the functionality that

00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,130
they needed it was common feature set

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,100
with what we were developing anyhow it's

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,709
actually a much simpler feature set but

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,709
what it what it is allowing their users

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:04,660
to do is is deploy the function so so

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,329
get lab has about a hundred thousand

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,940
unique open source projects anybody that

00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:12,339
has a function that they want to publish

00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,750
to ake a native or kubernetes can

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,459
publish that that was one of our

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,860
features that's the one they're gonna

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,110
take advantage of first the second one

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,139
is the ability to publish any tiny cloud

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,959
which will be

00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:29,540
made available to every single one of

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:31,249
the gate lab users so mark on the on the

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,980
market adoption rate you know seen

00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,779
enterprises really just starting to

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,269
container eyes and adopt kubernetes is

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,730
an orchestration layer and you could

00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:43,399
argue that doing function as a service

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,429
as a next step mm-hmm I'm interested in

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,230
your take on you know I wouldn't I don't

00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:51,949
think of gitlab as a traditional

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,779
enterprise right so are you going after

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:57,699
web-based companies and saying hey look

00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:00,410
we abstract away the underlying service

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,540
capability from the hyper scalar so you

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,129
can do whatever you want and that's the

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,529
value prop or is that you go to

00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,509
enterprise and say this is the next step

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,769
on the journey you should start working

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,290
with us now and you do that in

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,549
conjunction with like OpenShift or Cloud

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,679
Foundry or something like that can you

00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:17,029
talk a little bit about that Jarek so

00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,359
there's there's two parts to that

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,730
question there's actually we feel like

00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:24,559
the evolution so there was

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,059
infrastructure service which moved

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,279
rather slowly and then platform

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,379
as-a-service is sort of a stopover feel

00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,299
like serverless is the manifestation of

00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,669
where the company the cloud market has

00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,379
been going for quite some time so we

00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:39,499
think that each one of these steps is

00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:41,419
growing faster than the step before we

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,769
feel like that the specialty cloud

00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,529
providers and we're thinking about

00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,939
people like ASAP and digitalocean and

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,879
people that aren't part of those big

00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:52,489
three are going to be serving more

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,559
service functions to a large variety of

00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:57,470
users and those would be the toe dippers

00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,989
so they will be people that are in big

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,189
enterprises but they're they're starting

00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:03,259
out with serverless so we want to

00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:05,749
establish ourselves as a management

00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,169
platform a server list early and we want

00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:10,939
to use the especially cloud platform

00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:13,100
providers as sort of a channel to get

00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:16,039
them on our platform we also believe

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,499
that as intern side the firewall people

00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,569
are gonna get there's more and more

00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,879
self-service IT they're more developer

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:24,410
driven than they were 20 years ago IT is

00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,839
a core competency in so many other

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,749
places and the serverless paradigm of

00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,329
delivering server list capabilities is

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,910
what these developers can can

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,850
soon in a more self-service math manner

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:43,100
and it speeds their time to value from

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:45,559
development I have a question about K

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,049
native or native yeah sure oh that the

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,170
pronunciation is canid okay native yeah

00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:52,519
the so this is the Google lead project

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,589
that I guess builds on top of this tio

00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,179
and kind of has a serverless abstraction

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:00,379
like an event yes event uh middle work

00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:02,239
is that a project that you're gonna be

00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,829
contributing a lot of upstream

00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,600
engineering resources to and sort of try

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,999
and control and get a lot of influence

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,829
around or what's the investment sort of

00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:12,199
dynamic there in terms of contributing

00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:13,879
to K native yeah so so we won't want to

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:16,579
have influenced by our participation

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,730
there and when they announced K native

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:23,420
they actually quoted three companies

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,299
included pivotal Red Hat t-mobile and my

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,220
partner Sebastian from trigger matches

00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,670
having the vision for where this was

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,739
going

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,629
so we want to get there for influence

00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:35,449
there are some things that we will be

00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:38,509
doing to actually contribute on behalf

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,839
of our partners one of our partner or

00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:43,220
potential partners wants to enable

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,769
advanced features in their hardware

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,399
that's running kubernetes based clouds

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:50,839
these kinds of things will will will do

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,749
work for higher and will extend our

00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,110
product where appropriate but but we

00:13:53,749 --> 00:14:00,019
will want to be in the cloud computing

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,410
I'm sorry the cloud native competing

00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:05,029
foundation is where events the events

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,329
working group is and the events are

00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:10,279
really the that standardization around

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:12,470
events and triggers is really what's

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,459
driving cloud and specifically the

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:19,819
service industry so standards groups

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,949
which obvious I used to be a sec Yuta

00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:24,709
VAT the Linux Foundation my my colleague

00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:27,499
runs CN CF will participate there and

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,629
we're appropriate what I what I plan to

00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:32,689
do is rather than try and build a brand

00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:34,759
around a open source technology and

00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:38,600
monetize it which I've done many times

00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,860
before is actually picked the technology

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,769
that is going to have the broadest

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,750
industry use and then augment that in a

00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:48,130
way that makes sense for us as a company

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,690
and for the project it's the Nash

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:58,580
equilibrium for open source that so many

00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:01,000
people miss for our third presenter the

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:05,559
evening trigger mesh

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,559
