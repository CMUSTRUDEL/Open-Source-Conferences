hey everyone it's pretty exciting for me

00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,620
to be here and it's a huge honor for me

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,900
to be giving a keynote at this year's

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,910
all things open conference my first time

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,820
here so yay for being able to attend for

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:22,339
the first time and give a speech over

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,369
the past 7 to 8 years I've spent my time

00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,140
working for an open source come social

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,300
enterprise that has its roots in Kenya

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,769
and have been primarily focused on

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,649
trying to notch our open source

00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,760
community from East Africa so what I'm

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,800
going to do over the next couple of

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,600
minutes is share insights from building

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,180
and using open source software in Africa

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,309
and the developing world at large while

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,320
looking at what opportunities exist for

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:47,300
the open source movement as a developing

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,190
world becomes you know increasingly

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,500
connected now I'm going to be

00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,269
referencing Africa the African continent

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,339
a whole lot in my talk in line with my

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:58,129
own experiences in the continent over

00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,749
the years but to start with let me first

00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,460
give you some historical background into

00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:03,829
who we are as a Shahidi and how we

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,869
started with Shahid Azhar so Hayley what

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,150
that means testimony we are a technology

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,930
company whose mission is to raise the

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,729
voices of marginalized groups using

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,110
technology and help the organizations

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,880
that stop them to listen and respond

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,470
better we were born out of the

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,060
post-election violence that broke out in

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,439
Kenya back in 2007 2008 when results

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,210
were announced after our general

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,579
elections they were lightly contested

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,049
and what happened then was that violence

00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,000
then broke out across the entire country

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,890
the mainstream media was unable to

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,659
report exactly what was happening in

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,860
different parts of the country and the

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,590
government was also trying to downplay

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,810
how severe the situation was and so what

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,210
of a group of Kenyan bloggers did was

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,820
then you know set up a web platform that

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,750
allowed for ordinary citizens to send in

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,920
text messages emails tweets or use

00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,930
smartphone applications to share

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,250
messages around what was happening

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,930
around them it could be that there were

00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,969
riots in their areas or there are people

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,820
trying to break in or any positive

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,280
message around the time and that crisis

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,899
was was happening essentially giving

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,690
Kenyans of voice when no one else could

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:11,840
or would now it's important note that

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,000
back then in 2008 the internet worked

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,300
fairly well in Kenya and what that did

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,760
was

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,440
for people across the entire world who

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,360
are connected to actually see what was

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,800
happening in the country those of us who

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,420
are stuck in our houses were able to log

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,340
in and see that hey you know maybe these

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,960
pockets of violence happening in one

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,060
area as opposed to the other one it's

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,560
safe for me to go here and people who

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,120
are in the desk for who wanted to know

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,490
what was happening to the families back

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,490
home could also do the same thing right

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,840
since then we've seen an exponential

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,570
increase in the number of connected

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,730
individuals across the world now this

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,590
animated gif shows you progress of

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,780
connecting undersea fiber-optic cables

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,570
across Africa Middle East and Asia

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:59,410
between the year 2000 and 2013 I am

00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:02,000
hoping that this is working boo it's not

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,310
the idea is that you are going to see

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,170
you know the chronology of the undersea

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,090
cables getting connected across the

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,500
entire African continent what you're

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,540
seeing on your screen right now is an

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,850
image of the African undersea cables in

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,650
2018 and from this you can see that a

00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,380
vast majority of the African continent

00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,520
is actually really connected right the

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,680
percentage of the world's population

00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,250
that is connected to the Internet has

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,310
grown from 4.1 percent at the end of

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:36,640
1999 to 54.4% as of December last year

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,870
that is huge now in as much as the

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
interconnectivity in Africa is not as

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,640
higher than some of the other continents

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,310
its Internet capacity growth is much

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,010
faster than anywhere else in the world

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,040
users in Africa are more about you know

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,020
20 percent every year in Kenya alone

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,739
were seeing Internet penetration having

00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,900
grown from 0.7 percent to 18 9.4 in the

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,850
last 10 years this is according to

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,890
research by the communications authority

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,770
of Kenya and I think one of the reasons

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,350
why this is the case is you know this

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,080
increased broadband accessibility

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,180
primarily because of the affordability

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,830
of mobile phones and the penetration of

00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,620
you know mobile phones within my country

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,419
I mean for example my granddad in the

00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,230
village has access to a smartphone

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,570
application

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,610
it was smartphone and he's able to get

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,440
connected on whatsapp that that is huge

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,800
and he lives in an area where this new

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,500
electro

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,419
so that in itself speaks to how you know

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,340
connected people are getting now as the

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,680
world became increasingly connected

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,900
we've also seen use of it we shall he

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,360
deep platform grow as well in that time

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,599
in the last ten years we've seen this

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,909
platform of ours being used more than

00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:51,740
150 thousand times across three

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:53,599
categories of social impact namely

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,360
political crisis you know for example

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:58,159
the Kenan election we were born out of

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,039
citizen advocacy and human rights

00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,479
mapping as well as crisis response so

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,430
when you think the Haiti earthquake the

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,650
Nepal earthquake and the Hurricanes here

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,620
and there the platform has been used for

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,810
those instances we've been able to

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,860
collect more than 50 million reports

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,539
from citizens across the globe across

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,460
160 different countries and the

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,819
beautiful thing about this is that this

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,710
is a tool those built in Africa a tool

00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:26,569
that was born out of problems you always

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,210
tend to associate with Africa low

00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:31,069
bandwidth bad governance and the

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,099
philosophy that helped us kind of you

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:36,319
know build this platform in order to be

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:38,690
able to you know reach that many people

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,699
is we employed a mobile-first approach

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,380
you know the mobile phone is the most

00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,360
ubiquitous tool is it's the one thing

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,590
that everybody has access to you know

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,300
when you get in trouble you pick up your

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,360
phone to call someone right

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,979
and so we innovated around that tool

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,389
that people already have access to and

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:56,569
lower those barriers have entered those

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,400
barriers of communication and we you

00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:00,560
know we basically thought that if it

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,029
works in Africa to work anywhere that's

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,080
a story for another day friend we talked

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:08,449
about that a little bit more you can

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:11,900
find me after today's talk in the recent

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:14,029
stage of the October 2018 report github

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,699
reported having more than 8 million new

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:18,500
developers joined the community new

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,509
signups sped up across Middle East

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,270
Africa and Southeast Asia in particular

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,719
you can see the Egypt is a third and

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,690
Nigeria is a close fourth right so you

00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,789
can see this does validate the fact that

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,120
as we continue to be get increasingly

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:38,330
connected that this increase uptick of

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,039
open source tools but what is why you

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,690
know what catalyze this uptick of opens

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,480
us across

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,870
in my opinion it's a combination of two

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,190
things

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,830
I'm going to explain this first one

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,380
which is what we call the pothole theory

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,920
right and the basis for this theory is

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,280
that it takes an event or something that

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,920
affects you directly to make you go over

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,240
and beyond to actually act and I'm going

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,650
to use an example that's a little closer

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,680
to home for all of you right now

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,880
right there's news across antara world

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,130
around people going out to vote for this

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,780
upcoming election in the US right now

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,060
for us it's news and it's important

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,890
right but for those of you who are based

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,630
in the United States because it directly

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,820
affects you because of the decisions are

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,770
saying the Senate is taking you feel a

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,810
little bit more in part to go out you

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,130
know either go run campaigns or call

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,140
your Senators if you see just to try and

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,790
get people to actually go out and make

00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,680
an informed decision for those of us

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,470
staying back home in Africa those of us

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,240
in in Kenya it's good for us to know but

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,670
then there isn't much that I'll be able

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,340
to do when I'm sitting back home and my

00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:44,290
in my computer write news about a

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,700
pothole getting fixed right outside my

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,650
street at home would be something to

00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,450
make me jump up and down because every

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,550
day I'm driving across a pothole I'm

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,830
either getting bumped up in my car or I

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,550
have to constantly take my car to to get

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,890
fixed so it really does capitalize on

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,690
the fact that when seeing a lot more

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,100
people becoming empowered to fix their

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,590
own problems in their own communities

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,440
and not sit around and wait for somebody

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,060
else to come in solve it for them now

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,280
the second way which is connected to

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,600
this is that I think the reason why

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,850
people are becoming a little bit more

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,260
empowered than feeling like they can

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,530
actually jump in and try and sort out

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,000
situations in their communities is in

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,310
actual fact because of increased

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,530
connectivity right because of them being

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,910
in Crete you know getting getting online

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,590
feeling like they can share their

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,840
opinions getting to see what the other

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,940
groups of people are doing there is a

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,979
direct correlation between increased

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,410
connectivity and uptick of open source

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,969
tools across the world which is why I

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,860
think that connecting the next billion

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,620
has become such a huge priority for the

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,940
world with X with expectations of

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,850
profound impact on the Bluebook

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,170
so what opportunities does this present

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,540
in particular for the open source

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,980
community improved accessibility now

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,080
making the OSHA Headey platform

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,970
open-source when we began was a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,790
deliberate effort by the OSHA he found

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,410
us to make it accessible to anyone

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,250
anywhere in the world and lower barriers

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,500
of use of that technology right being

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,630
able to reach more than being able to

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,000
collect more than 50 million reports how

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,800
this platform gets used in 160 countries

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,840
more than a hundred and fifty thousand

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,580
times is not something that would have

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,410
happened if this was not a to those made

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,630
open-source it would never have happened

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,510
if you only made the tool available in

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,410
the English language right we really you

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,270
know partnered with different

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,890
organizations empower the community to

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,440
jump in and help us translate and make

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,000
it accessible in different languages to

00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,580
make it much easier for them to make use

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,370
of again lowering the barriers of entry

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,410
allowing the buyers of use of technology

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,240
and what happens when you lower these

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,560
barriers is that you see exponential

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,080
growth and I think that will actually

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,270
continue to see more uptake to

00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,950
open-source tools across the world now

00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,620
meant to reference the octopus report

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,160
one more time github growth in new

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,170
signups in the last year is the largest

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,500
seen in the first six years of github

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,510
combined as of September 30th this year

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,550
more open source projects had been

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,200
created in the Asian region than

00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,080
anywhere else in the world

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,060
just yesterday doing the diversity and

00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,920
inclusion event we were in a breakout

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,050
session around creating safe spaces and

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,390
one of the people in our group actually

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,750
mentioned or spoke about a fast-growing

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,790
node.js community in Nigeria right it's

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,590
grown so big that they vastly started

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:40,090
their own chapter of new J's in Africa

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:43,540
right one of the other opportunities

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,950
that open source presents for the

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,110
developing countries as we continue to

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,550
get connected is being able to build

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,330
capacity and create employment

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,740
opportunities let me explain why

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,390
contributing to open source provides a

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,760
unique opportunity for people to learn

00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,980
new skills which also helps them to

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,230
build a professional reputation now

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,000
according to a free

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,060
opens a survey those conducted a couple

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,310
of years back 30% of the people who

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,080
participated in that survey said that

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,570
they participate in open source to

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:17,280
improve their job opportunities another

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,200
30% said that you know them

00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,670
participating actually they were able to

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,350
directly derive income from

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,260
participating in open source projects

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,510
and another 18% indirectly deriving

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,980
income perhaps from visibility on

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,980
working on a project that leads to them

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,830
getting a job one of the sustainable

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,200
development goals revolves around decent

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,390
work and economic growth sustainable

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,770
economic growth will require societies

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,830
to create conditions that allow for

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,230
people acquiring quality jobs that

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,820
stimulate the economy and I think that

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,740
the open source movement movement

00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,020
definitely provides a unique opportunity

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,060
to helping to solve youth unemployment

00:11:52,020 --> 00:12:00,780
in the developing world which casts a

00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:03,750
huge shadow on economic growth when we

00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,030
started OSHA he did Prem

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,860
it was primarily focused on crisis

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,050
management so you look at the very first

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,430
example it was a crisis it was you know

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,130
electrode violence trying to figure out

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,380
how to sort out that situation but over

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,940
the years as a tool ended up getting

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,030
used what we've seen is that it got

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,070
adapted for various use cases right from

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,050
election monitoring to tracking cases of

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,630
sexual harassment in Egypt and in India

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,090
and that has also supported creation of

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,950
new business social venture or social

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:34,020
ventures and opportunities in those

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,330
regions to support that kind of work now

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm going to reference a harassment

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,090
example specifically because it's one

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,410
that's pretty special or pretty close to

00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,050
my heart

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,660
back in 2010 a group of women who were

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,070
working and living in Cairo were tired

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,840
of the constant harassment that they

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,310
would experience in the streets and so

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,280
what they did was came together to then

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,260
set up the OSHA Healy platform to help

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,330
them document cases of sexual harassment

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,650
happening against women right now back

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,200
then when they started off it was

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:03,270
primarily focused on trying to create

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,150
awareness about what was going on right

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,070
but then over time as it got as it

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,300
picked up traction the conversation

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,010
moved away from creating awareness

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,320
because now people you know knew about

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,690
it into how do we create

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,950
Haverhill change right how do we you

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,260
know move the conversation away from

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,100
this this is happening to how exactly do

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,200
we actually solve the problem now what

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,820
we've seen over the last 10 years is

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,640
that they've actually invested in trying

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,500
to do a lot more research into this kind

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,060
of behavior we've also seen a lot of

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,320
other different countries across and

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,780
child while trying to replicate that

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,750
same model of tracking case of sexual

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,200
harassment and that team that team in

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:45,810
Egypt is now focused on trying to come

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
up with replicable model so using all

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,230
the lessons that they've learned over

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,760
those years to document you know what

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,640
you know what strategies do you need to

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,530
employ to whether it's creating

00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,650
partnerships or you know actually doing

00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,970
outreach et Cie and then going as far as

00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,220
you know what you need to do to

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,620
customize it to within your own local

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,510
context and in that way they've been

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,670
able to form you know an organization

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,940
around how to actually do that work a

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,410
social venture so to me the beautiful

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,420
thing the beautiful thing about open

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,640
source software open systems is the fact

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,730
that it's generative in by nature it

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,380
provides a framework or a skeleton upon

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,530
which people can build on top of and

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,960
adapt to the local context it allows for

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,240
people to take these tools make them

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,980
their own and use them in ways that we

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,260
could never imagine without having to

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,030
start from scratch entrepreneurs can

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,740
build a value-added products on top of

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,680
open-source giving startups quicker time

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,530
to market well developing while lowering

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,150
development costs now my timer is at 30

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,440
seconds let's hope I can finish in 30

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:51,060
seconds but I am at the end I think in

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,590
general that there's a huge paradigm

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,360
shift that's been happening the

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,400
information landscape is rapidly

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,010
changing we're no longer looking at

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,920
groups or individuals from developing

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,320
countries as passive recipients or users

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,970
but active participants and contributors

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,390
to solving problems in the communities

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,770
in innovative ways we've always imagined

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,380
the developing world as a place that

00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,300
receives technology and innovation but I

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,770
think that's going to shift as we see

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,650
more and more contribution coming up

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,540
from the developing world now really is

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,310
the time for us to invest in building

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,310
and fostering open source communities in

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,110
the developing world

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,170
and nurturing the culture of innovation

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,880
at a local level thank you so much for

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,220
your time

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,220
