Lewis and all of the volunteers here all

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,590

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,389
me it's my first year here

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,350
alex was sharing with me hits a second

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,810
but this has been going on for quite

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,029
some time you know I think that software

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,130
engineers people who are developers are

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,689
very highly creative they're artists so

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,130
I'd like for you all because you've got

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,570
had your lunch and you've gone to a

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,669
couple of sessions now to stand up

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,350
that's right stand up and share your

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,940
love for all things open by hugging the

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,940
person to the left or right of you

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:58,250
[Music]

00:00:50,890 --> 00:01:00,500
brilliant now you can sit down as Alex

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,239
was mentioning earlier and I don't know

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,859
am i working I'm not very good with

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,939
things that aren't battery-operated am I

00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,060
doing this right John

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:10,130
there we are okay as Alex had mentioned

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,780
earlier I've been very fortunate and

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,240
that I took my career in law enforcement

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,100
strategy and was able to apply a lot of

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,630
the work all those who came in late that

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,960
are sitting the back please move forward

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,429
yes come on come on it's okay

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,069
these people showered some of them even

00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:25,459
have put cologne on perfume come on it's

00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:29,090
okay

00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:30,709
no one's gonna bite you um I don't know

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,259
what direction this goes in John okay

00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:35,569
there we are so this is the hashtag and

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,880
the social media handle the person who

00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,890
tweets the most who instagrams the most

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,479
of these of what I have to share there

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,039
will be some good shareable moments I'm

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,830
actually gonna give you an hour of my

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,539
time to go through your presence is

00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,380
whether you have a blog whether you have

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,209
a website

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,800
your you know your social media

00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,489
presences to help you get all that

00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,830
cleaned up I'm often asked how I got

00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,209
into strategy there's a TED talk out

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,910
there but I'll try to give it to you

00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:04,340
briefly I was working in Quantico

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,750
Virginia I met somebody in Atlanta

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,250
Georgia when I was working for the

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,399
Georgia Bureau of Investigation's on a

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,640
crystal methamphetamine program no I

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,610
didn't get to do it but I did get to

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,129
prevent it so while I was there I fell

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,409
madly in love with an entrepreneur that

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,170
being said I had a life event that

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:25,909
occurred in 1999 that caused me to go

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,980
into a different direction so if you

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,200
google my name and TED talk it's all

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,790
there but I always get asked like how

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,319
the hell are you at this conference like

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,360
what do you have it what do you why are

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,670
you here you know so I always find that

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,080
that's a good thing to kind of to share

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,870
and what I learned from that experience

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,250
I'm bringing to you today those of you

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,030

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,680

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,330

yeah okay so what I need to tell you is

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:28,390
that communication has changed right how

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,630
we are perceived by the people around us

00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,950
has changed dramatically many of you how

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,740
many of you work for a company you don't

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:39,820
work for yourselves okay about 85

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:44,800
percent of the room almost 90 everything

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:47,650
you post every like every watch of a

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,160
video or a comment you are branding

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,810

of your brand the company you work for

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,810
but you yourself succinctly and

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,720
communications change how many of you

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,970
have you know in a mad rush have had to

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,229
leave a message for somebody and you you

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,390
know you call the number and it says

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,860
you've reached eight oh three five five

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,090
five one two one two

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,069
we don't really know if you've got the

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,599
right number now do you even the

00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:19,659
outgoing greeting on your mobile phone

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:24,490
is the opportunity for you to brand

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:27,219
yourself so how you respond in an email

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,099
how you respond to a tweet how many of

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:31,840
you have to do presentations as part of

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:35,229
your job raise your hands

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,340
so about 75% of the room good so you

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,020
know the hell I'm feeling right now

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,129
thank you thank you so much yeah and

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,279
because we live in this world of pen

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,479
communication right we're viewed I mean

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,979
as I'm standing in front of you right

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,539
now there are people judging me they're

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,080
women back there going God her thighs

00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:54,400
are huge and there are some women out

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,039
there they're going how can she manage

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,110
to walk in those clown shoes these are

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
my Lady Gaga shoes only she has a pair I

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,500
feel very fortunate to own these one of

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
my boss has got them for me for a

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,520
Christmas gift I would have never spent

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,099
this kind of money anyway the other

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,169
thing that we do too is that when we

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,000
respond back to somebody in the office

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,860
which a lot of us use email as a primary

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,719
everybody use emails primary

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,139
communication tool at work okay you do

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,819
right

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,039
you're even judged for the tone of your

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,440
emails you might knock something off

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,690
really quickly to get to a boss or to a

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,870
colleague and I bill are you having a

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:30,940
bad day no I just answered you

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,210
succinctly was I supposed to put hearts

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,949
and flowers and happy faces on it okay

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,089
so we're being judged by how we

00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:43,710
communicate - Brian cannons point it's

00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:47,819
your reputation it's who you are right

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,819
now let's talk a little bit about

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:54,159
personal branding and social media and

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:57,849
life people need to know like and trust

00:06:54,159 --> 00:07:01,150
you how many of you are managers or

00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:02,889
directors where you are now okay now I

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,330
want you to keep put your hand up if you

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,210
have the desire to move up in your

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,419
company some people like either desire

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,710
to move out Doroteo but that's fine and

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,270
I talk to a lot of entrepreneurs right

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,610
you've got to be passionate about this

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,960
why are we doing - thank you again this

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,129
isn't battery-operated so I don't know

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,830
how to work it okay

00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,899
be patient with me so here's the thing

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,650
you've got to be able to manage your

00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:27,690
brand both on and offline

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,699
when you present when you send those

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,250
emails when you tweet something out when

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,750
you share something we're now in a world

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,919
that if you were to write something

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,530
let's say about your political or

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,930
religious views you are going to be

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,100
judged

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,509

gay wedding two lovely men were getting

00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,380
married and I thought I should go

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,690
someplace to try to find a gift for them

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,219

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,350
pleasure and so I'm walking around and I

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,779
see Paula Dean cookery it's a beautiful

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,360
set of pots and pans and sauce pans and

00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,760
frying pans it has her name on it her

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,779
logo and they'd been marked down from a

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,160
hundred and seventy nine dollars

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:07,620
previously JCPenney I might add to $4.99

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,330
and it sat on the shelf collecting dust

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,070
and I thought to myself that would be a

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,220
great picture for this presentation oh

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,950
how the mighty have fallen

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,220
what's she doing today I don't know Shia

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:24,270
LeBouf huh who would throw him out of

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:27,180
bed for eating crackers Shia LeBouf okay

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:30,570
here's a famous actor he's a producer

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,079
director he forgets that people in

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,970
Hollywood have a fairly long memory Shia

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,899
LeBouf tried to pass off a script that

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,540
he said that he wrote guess what

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:43,459
didn't somebody else did and he put his

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,410
name on it and one thing about show

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,059
runners and script right right readers

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,100
you know they have memories like an

00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,610
elephant for those foreigners in this

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:56,029
room Google that anyway

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,459
so Shia LeBouf okay got caught and so

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:01,069
what does he do he retires from all

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:06,110
public you know all public appearances

00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:10,009
his work as an actor again Shia naughty

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:19,369
naughty boy hmm and then of course this

00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:24,559
happened and this and this and this but

00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:29,089
let's not forget America's father your

00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:31,429
actions will follow you online and

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,290
offline you're probably thinking well

00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:35,389
personal branding I don't really need it

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,129
you know I I've got a LinkedIn I'm I'm

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:41,779
fine at my job may I remind you that it

00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,399
was a strong personal brand that just

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,470
won the president election here in the

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:50,360
United States can I get an amen

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,319
thank you somebody's awake back there

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,589
good good good

00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:55,939
so we all of us some of you actually do

00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,379
the same thing as the person sitting

00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:01,100
directly to the right or left of you

00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:03,879
your programmer developer may be a

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,610
project manager maybe you're in robotics

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:10,490
all of us have something about us that

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,399
make gives us a natural ability to stand

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,839
out I pick on LeBron James cuz I mean

00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,329
who wouldn't the man's a genius

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,699
look at him but he also gives a lot of

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,829
money and time as an entrepreneur to

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:25,009
businesses in his hometown of Cleveland

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,740
so go LeBron each and every one of you

00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:31,249
has something about you that makes you

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,379
different so when you look at your

00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:35,689
industry and you think oh gosh but I'm a

00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,220
programmer and so is John yeah but your

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:38,889
approach is different it's your

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,139
personality it's who you are

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,910
people can't see inside of us they can't

00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:46,549
see that natural ability that helps us

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,249
stand out please don't go to this man's

00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:50,899
website I found this photo at 3 o'clock

00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:53,600
in the morning one night

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,619
it's a little racy yeah but I thought

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
that it would do a good job of showing

00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:57,529
standing out as you know as a good

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,220
visual yeah

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,660
so so that being said um these natural

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,569
abilities these things that help you

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,740
kind of stand out is how you develop

00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:11,689
your passion and your own personal brand

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,920
people can't see inside of you they

00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,379
don't know what you stand for they don't

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,360
you know your mores your your funny

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,920
quirky sense of humor or that that

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,839
snarky little email that we talked about

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,119
earlier that you know didn't have Bose

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,879
and and happy faces and hearts on it

00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:29,269
right but they know that what you do and

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:31,040
the value that you add it's located to

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,360
be a braggadocio it's okay to talk about

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,550
the things that you've done that are

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,379
good that you're appreciated for so what

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,170
I want to do today is kind of explore

00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:41,660
that theory and that said I had a client

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,819
that was perfect for this presentation

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,949
today I took him from IT manager he's

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,829
just was named CTO four months ago of a

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:51,399
company in Ohio we met when he was

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,899
living and working in South Carolina and

00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,149
funnily enough the company that he works

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,410
for is publicly traded so when I asked

00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,209
him if it was possible to have him as

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,459
part of this presentation you said I'm

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:03,470
so new on my job I don't want to you

00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,179
know upset the applecart so I do have

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,740
two really good examples but be mindful

00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:09,499
that one of them is a creative just like

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,970
all of you so that being said I want to

00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:13,370
first talk about and define what is a

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,050
brand okay

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,639
a brand is a reflection of the

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,339
relationship an organization has with

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,540
its customers embodying with what with

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,540
that with which an organization is

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,999
committed to a stands for how many of

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,069
you spend let's say 9:00 to 5:00 Monday

00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:30,199
through Friday on the Internet

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,429
you're in front of a computer hundred

00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,959
percent of the room okay great

00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:37,910
you see about 7,000 brand images you're

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,529
forced to there's ads that come up

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,929
things that happen in your email

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:46,370
somebody might talk about something yeah

00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:47,809
you know how many you remember for you

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,209
go to your local grocery store right

00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:53,679
you're gonna buy either the Publix brand

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:55,970
of paper towels or brogni you buy brawny

00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,490
people spend twelve to eighteen percent

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:02,720
more on a brand that they trust that

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,670
they like that they know coca-cola

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,490
anybody in here ever had a coke

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,560
yeah they spend 55 percent of their

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,960
marketing budget just so that when

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,480
you're thirsty one of their products is

00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:17,300
at arm's reach Dasani water peak tea

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
sprite coca-cola I noticed that Pepsi

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,340
was a sponsor of this event go all

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,440
things open anyway I'm a coca-cola is a

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,120
client of mine so I can pick on them but

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,340
but brands are really interesting when

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,760
you think about it because you know they

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,650
are you know distinctive they stand for

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,140
something you know they have a point of

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,700
view they're relevant what they stands

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,070
for and what they stand for connects

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,870
with with what you like I just met Alex

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,460
today the guy who was generous enough to

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,850
emcee this event thank you again Alex

00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,950
for that lovely introduction he actually

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,870
got my name right little hand clap for

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Alex nicely done Alex that wasn't that

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,280
wasn't easy to do I mean my last name

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,420
isn't Smith for sake anyway so

00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,280
also brands are very consistent right

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,170
people let's go back people come to know

00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,170
and believe in the relationship they

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,300
have based on consistent behaviors so at

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,430
work when you have that let's say you

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,680
know quarterly review have you noticed

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,510
like the same accolades come out you

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,740
know Bryan is very smart he's very

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,630
organized when it comes to these

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,730
meetings I really like this this and

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,930
this oh but Bryan your snarky little

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,450
emails are going to get you in trouble

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,200
right these are the things that make up

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:29,660
your personal run so you know here's the

00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,030
thing personal branding is really not

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,330
anything new there was a book that came

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:38,000
out in 1981 called positioning the

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,950
battle for your mind by Jack trout more

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,890
and a guy named Al Reyes something

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,730
something let me tell you it's a

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,630
book don't get it

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,460
but chapter 23 starts talking about how

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,520
you can position yourself in your

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,250
organization in your industry right as a

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,440
thought leader now this is back in 1981

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,960
can you imagine what your digital

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
footprint needs to look like now so

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,570
somebody might think that you're a

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,030
thought leader in podcasting or

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:11,540
publishing or robotics or programming or

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,610
Java you know what have you so it's

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,240
really important that you need to think

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:19,370
about you know your personal brand

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,230
and kids this is that Instagram a bowl

00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,820
or treatable moment so I really want you

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,600
to listen cuz I want somebody to win the

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,290
hour with me

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,170
right your personal brand is the

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:32,750
perception or emotion maintained by

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:37,190
somebody other than you that describes

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,529
the entire relationship of having an

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,920
experience having a relationship with

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,510
you right again let me repeat that your

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,910
personal brand is the perception or

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,570
emotion maintained by somebody other

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,220
than you and your mother that describes

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,589
the experience of having a relationship

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,230
with you so that's what we're going to

00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,880
explore today I'm gonna ask another

Stewart born in Jersey City New Jersey

00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:07,409
August 3rd 1941 the second of six

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,899
children in a middle-class family where

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:12,749
her parents Edward or Eddie Costra and

00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:15,029
his wife Martha Rose Kowski Costra were

00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:17,519
entirely entirely of Polish heritage at

00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,830
three years old the family moved to

00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,619
Nutley New Jersey now this is why this

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:26,779
is significant she moved in a

00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,779
neighborhood where all of at the time

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,659
I'm back okay so she moved to a

00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,669
neighborhood right where the Yankees

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,080
were living Mickey Mantle Yogi Berra

00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:52,149
anybody old enough here to know who the

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,349
Yankees are they're our baseball team

00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,090
children yes

00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:56,830
so what wound up happening is she wound

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,139
up around 1011 years old

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,320
becoming a babysitter to Gil McDougald

00:21:59,139 --> 00:22:04,899
Mickey Mantle and also other members

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,879
Yogi Berra of the the Yankees now that

00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:08,440
something it was really interesting she

00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:10,330
really took to babysitting and she was

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,919
really good at it right to the point

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,830
where Martha was getting kind of a well

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,349
known name as a prepubescent teenager

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,570
what have you and her mother taught her

00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:21,009
how to cook and so her grandparents who

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,379
lived in Buffalo New York taught her had

00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:24,700
a can she funnily enough learned about

00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:28,359
gardening from her father because it was

00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,979
one of his hobbies as a Polish a Polish

00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:32,409
heritage he had a garden when he was a

00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:34,119
little kid living in Poland some of her

00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,039
extracurricular activities were that she

00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,679
ran and worked with the school newspaper

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,019
in her teens and then also was a member

00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,119
of the art club but Mickey man all asked

00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,460
her at the ripe old age of 14 could you

00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:49,749
help us organize a birthday party for my

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:53,950
sons so she did it and she was good at

00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:54,369
it and she liked it at 15 which you see

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,499
here

00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:58,719
Martha began modeling now here was

00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:00,669
something really interesting at the time

00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,139
it was kind of unheard of for a girl

00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:06,099
from New Jersey to just go into New York

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:08,529
City and sign a contract but she did she

00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:10,359
was getting paid $50 an hour back then

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:12,539
that was a lot of money to model for

00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,659
people like Unilever Chanel to Ducie

00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,950
cigarette commercials and she decided to

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:20,200
start college she applied and was

00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,839
accepted to Barnard Wall at Barnard she

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,690
met a guy named Andrew Stewart obviously

00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:28,509
Stewart was not her birth name they met

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,369
they married in 1961 and she wound up

00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:32,979
going back to school to finish her

00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:36,309
degree in art history and architectural

00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:37,570
history now they they decided that they

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,190
were going to move to Westport

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,019
Connecticut and they bought this house

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,029
that was at one of those renovators it

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,349
was on it's called Turkey Hill I'm son

00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,940
Turkey Hill Road and that's the house

00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,919
that they actually modeled after Martha

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,230
Stewart Living zhh kitchen one of you

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,100
watch any of her shows

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,450
but Andrew was actually sort of a scion

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,880
of the publishing community he had

00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,169
started out as a manager and editing at

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,929
a publishing house and then ultimately

00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:04,049
moved up to being CEO and rather than

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,460
having fancy parties at New York New

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:07,140
York restaurants and things like that

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,790
he decided well why don't we send people

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,919
out you know we'll make them feel really

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,450

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,580
by bus we'll bring them out to Westport

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,490
Connecticut and we'll celebrate you know

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,460
this new artists new author in our home

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,990
and Martha was happy to host people she

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,320
loved to do that she was you know again

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,240
very passionate about catering from some

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,679
of the first ever parties that they had

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,510
she realized I could make this a

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,309
business so she and a girlfriend got

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,809
together and they began a catering

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,490
business and they literally worked out

00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:37,470
of like this the bottom or basement

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,660
floor of a home putting kitchens in and

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,360
so on and so forth and then one day a

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,600
guy named Allan Merkin the head of crown

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,730

enjoying their food you really have a

00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,010
gift for something I think that you

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,480

started to take off Martha from there

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,500
stepped down and in 1993 she began her

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,720
first ever weekly half-hour special and

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,679
the program was basically based on

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,530
things that you could read in the

00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,230
magazine she was on the cover of the

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,570
1995 issue of New York magazine that

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,490
declared her the definitive American

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,730
woman of our time

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:09,030
in September 1997 she and her partner

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,370
Sharon Patrick created Omni media Martha

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:14,070
Stewart Omni media or MSO and it became

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,570
her you know her stock ticker a lot of

00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,929
people don't know this that in October

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,550
19 1999 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,730
went public on the New York Stock

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,710
Exchange and basically she started out

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,400
at 18 dollars a share and went up to 38

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,830
it made her the first ever self-made

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,679
female billionaire in the United States

00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:40,590
a lot of people don't know that I find

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:42,270
that fascinating unfortunately according

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,309
to the u.s. securities and stock

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,740
exchange and Exchange Commission the SEC

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,800
Stewart avoided a loss by selling about

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:54,179
4,000 shares of I am clone stock on

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,890
December 27 2001 she received this

00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:00,090
material nonpublic information from her

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:02,280
broker and notably she was arrested in

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,950
the months that followed Stewart true

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,830
very heavy media scrutiny and spent a

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:10,130
lot of time in jail time then had her on

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:13,350
the cover calling her Martha's mess and

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,030
after a highly publicized jury trial you

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,880
know in serving her sentence she was

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,330
sentenced by the way in July of 2004 she

00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,030
got out now imagine what that's like

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,110
you have an empire you have a name how

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,940
many of you have worked for a company

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,140
you've gotten laid off for through

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,750
whatever reason you left the company

00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,540
right and they were part of your CV okay

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,490
about 50% of the room right so imagine

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,660
that she had a brand that was married to

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,090
something else

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,160
someone else she was this huge media

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,910
conglomerate and now she's wearing an

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,710
orange jumpsuit now she could have just

00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,340
you know faded into oblivion

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,380
but Martha got smart when she got out of

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,760
jail it was all about reinventing Martha

00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,990
Stewart she even had her own apprentice

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,240
show for a time I don't know if you guys

00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,160
remember that she was on Betty she

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,020
played somebody who taught one of the

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,420
main characters Vanessa Williams how to

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:07,789
cook a Thanksgiving turkey she started

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:11,149
showing up more on CBS NBC's Today Show

00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:14,080
she had her own daytime show she was

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:17,749
nominated in six categories for the 33rd

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,070
Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006 she got back

00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:21,739
involved with Martha Stewart Living

00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:23,720
Omnimedia not as its CEO and not as a

00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:26,690
board member but as somebody that was

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,940
you know running the company and she

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,619
started to design for Macy's Kmart

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,659
JCPenney even Walmart different types of

00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:36,679
housewares and home goods one

00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:38,470
interesting thing that she did is she

00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,570
got involved with Ernest and Julio Gallo

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,919
vineyards and actually have a wine group

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,679
of wine that's Martha Stewart Living

00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,239
wine you can actually join a her wine

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,590
club and get wine delivered to your home

00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:53,659
if you're 21 or older she also has her

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,909
own line of food anybody shop at Costco

00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,159
at Costco under the Kirkland brand right

00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,989
so she's doing all these crazy things

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,119
like this is somebody who got handed a

00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:04,249
lot of lemons and I think that she made

00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:06,559
a great little lemon souffle I mean this

00:29:04,249 --> 00:29:09,229
is somebody that you know it is so

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,269
strong in her personal brand that she

00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:13,639
joined Snoop Dogg anybody knows Snoop

00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:15,619
Dogg the rapper Thank You children now I

00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:18,470
don't feel like I'm a hundred okay so

00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:20,749
who in fall of 2016 vh1

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,460
put Snoop Dogg and Martha and they have

00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:24,559
their own potluck dinner show it's

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,710
called snoop and Martha's potluck dinner

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,359
party and it features games recipes and

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,950
musical guests and it's actually pretty

00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,970
funny if you go back and look at some of

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,710
the shows I don't know if it's still in

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,869
existence but I've seen some on YouTube

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,669
and what-have-you and it's hilarious but

00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:40,190
she's so secure in her personal brand

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,289
that she allowed herself to participate

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:51,200
in this and John I'm going to need your

00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:55,179
help to give Justin Bieber some tips to

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,159
use when he inevitably ends up in prison

00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:00,590
you see when I did my stretch all the

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,389
hood rats on my cellblock wanted to

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:06,379
break off a piece of Martha Stewart's

00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:07,470
ass so I decided some needed to

00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:11,039
get guy

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:14,700
I walk into the chow hall picked out the

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,830
biggest bull and I suffered from then on

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,750
prison was easier than making blueberry

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,860
scones so as you can see she really put

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,230
herself out there let's talk a little

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,510
bit about her presences so Martha's

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,070
really keen on using Facebook as a way

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,400
to sign up not just for her newsletter

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:34,409
but also for her programs on Instagram

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,650
can I tell you I don't cook but she

00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:39,240
makes me want to her lifestyle photos on

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,909
Instagram and Pinterest are just

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,080
absolutely gorgeous and lush and she

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,700
makes you think that you could bake

00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,840
chocolate chip cookies the way that she

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,850
does on LinkedIn she's an influencer

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,710
here she's on Pinterest and then also on

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,690
Twitter one of the things I do like

00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,610
about her Twitter and I will say this is

00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,980
she's also very good at sharing the work

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:00,870
of her employees so if somebody's a

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,640
great gardener or a great Baker or they

00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,470
have a great you know something it's

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,450
their YouTube is the channel where she

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,640
shows all the celebrity visits that she

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,280
has on her show as well as her work with

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,470
charities and I would say I think that

00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,210
Martha does a very good job of really

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,220
sewing everything up on her personal

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,840
blog one of the things I also like about

00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,789
a blog if you sign up for her newsletter

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,140
you find out about these new programs

00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:24,330
that she's doing like an earnest and

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,610
Giulio Gallo vineyards the Kirkland you

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,440
know signature brand of food I mean who

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,000
wouldn't want to serve her appetizers at

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,200
a dinner party because God knows the

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,630
only thing I keep in my stove is

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,150
sweaters anyway so now I want to get to

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,710
my client shall we

00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:42,030
anybody ever see the movie Super Size Me

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,260
okay about 70% of the room so let me

00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,900
talk to you little about Super Size Me

00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,350
Super Size Me I forgot this has to go

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,220
with me

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:52,380
Super Size Me was part documentary in

00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,130
part movie right it was really about

00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,190
educating people on what fast food was

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:02,610
really doing to our health right how we

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,700
were causing both adults and children to

00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,130
be addicted to fast food and how by

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,960
supersizing your meal you were eating

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,200
well above and beyond your caloric

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,490
intake and it also showed through Morgan

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,500
Spurlock and hidden is that has

00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,170
then-fiance at the time Alexander Jane

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,780
that maybe eating a plant-based diet

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,300
might be a good alternative to not only

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,560
be healthier but also to be smarter

00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:31,140
right how it affects how we we eat so

00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,570
this is healthy chef Alex now I want to

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,780
go back to her for a second in the movie

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,280
she's his fiancee right she introduced

00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,940
the American public to things like

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:44,610
veganism vegetarian cooking you know

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,200
vegetables rather than meat tofu rather

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,090
than steak a lot of you're looking down

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,330
on going heavy ahead Carolina barbecue

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:54,860
Dorotea I have but the interesting thing

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,870
was it allowed her to be part of a brand

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,700
right and some cool things about her

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,140
she'd already been on Oprah Winfrey

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,420
she'd already been on Bryant Gumbel's

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,670
you know it'd be a great American I

00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,890
think it was called diet you know detox

00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:10,140
diet and she already kind of had a name

00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,240
for herself so she marries Morgan and

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,340
they also did another show called 28

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,140
days anybody see that on HGTV where the

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,760
couple tried to live on minimum wage in

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,110
New York City for a full month one

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,640
person up front is nodding her head so

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,780
she got a chance to see it and then I

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,590
got a call at three o'clock in the

00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,760
morning that they were getting a divorce

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,650
remember what I talked about earlier a

00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,120
lot of you have been involved with a

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,160
company for a long period of time maybe

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,510
you own your own company or you were

00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,090
working for a company and for whatever

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,280
reason he got laid off he got let go

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,810
right they were done with that project

00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,520
they didn't need you a great number of

00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:44,640
you a programmers that work project a

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,970
project right when you are married to

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,940
the brand and now all of a sudden you're

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,900
out on your own can you imagine having

00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,910
to rebuild your empire brick by brick

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,890
and that's exactly what we started out

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,530
on a journey to do I hope I don't I

00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,060
don't whatever reason shut this off

00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,310
again like I did before sorry for that

00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:10,470
okay so let's talk a little bit about

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:12,570
Alex Alex has written several books the

00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,040
great american detox diet vegan for

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,830
dummies

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,960
that means this is this still working

00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,980
sorry I feel like it's fading on on now

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,960
I don't know how much you know about

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,840
vegans right

00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,600
they're pretty militant about their diet

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,630
right some of them actually are very

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,310
vocal if you will and I'll get to more

00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,380
of that in a minute but I want to talk a

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,290
little bit more about Alex if I can so

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,880
Alex was a chef who had studied for a

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:43,830
very long time under a Michelin star

00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:46,500
chef in in Turin Italy her specific was

00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:48,870
how do you help get rid of disease

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,470
through nutrition so if somebody came to

00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:55,260
her you know with headaches or migraines

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:57,240
she'd find recipes or eczema right to

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,340
help cure them and that became sort of

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,500
her claim to fame she moves back to New

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,990
York City and gets a job as a pastry

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,630
chef at this very upscale vegetarian

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,800
restaurant called other foods now a lot

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,940
of you are very young in this room so

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,620
you may not know the name of the person

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,720
I'm about to mention so I'll school you

00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:17,700
Paul Newman walks in thank you for all

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,100
of those of you who laughed because I no

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,300
longer feel like a dinosaur Paul Newman

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,460
walks in with his wife Joanne Woodward

00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,610
he was still alive at the time has his

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,040
fabulous meal any orders dessert and the

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,900
dessert is her version of a Twix bar but

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,130
it's completely natural it's cacao it's

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,140
got all this crazy stuff and it's so

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,090
good for you it's not unhealthy right

00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,440
he's oh my god I want to meet the chef

00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,540
that made this this is my favorite candy

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,600
bar I've got got to meet him and of

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,370
course the waiter says her let me go get

00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,500
her so she comes out not really

00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:48,750
realizing who you know the person is

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,340
these two people have dined with us Alex

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,810
they're they're huge fans of your food

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,580
could you just come out and of course

00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,170
she's shaking Paul Newman's hand and

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,240
going oh my god I just met Paul Newman

00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:01,170
and Joanne Woodward and they're they're

00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,550
profuse about her food Paul Newman had a

00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,170
non-for-profit you all probably for me

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,030
with Newman's own chocolate chip cookies

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,280
a salad dressing okay but he also had

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,440
another nonprofit it still runs today

00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,510
called the hole-in-the-wall gang this is

00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,210
what they do they go into children's

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,150
hospitals because children you know have

00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,640
horrible diseases - right lupus cancer

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,170
they don't want to eat green jello no

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,870
they don't children no they want to eat

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,820
real food so he asked her would you be

00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,190
interested in being the nutritionist and

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:33,090
in these various hospitals I'll pay you

00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:36,240
to create good tasting healthy food for

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:39,780
children who to be quite frank with you

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,310
may or not may or may not make it and at

00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,850
that point she hung up her apron and

00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:47,220
said mr. Newman I'm your man

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,380
that's how she met Morgan at one of

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,500
their charity benefit events and that's

00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,070
how her career took off today as a

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,660
divorced woman she has a lot of

00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,150
presences but I need to kind of share

00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,800
with you what happened so 2011 when they

00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,060
divorce I take her on as a client

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,390
I'd already been working with the two of

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,100
them I had a choice I think I chose well

00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,450
but she gets on Jonathan fields podcast

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,100
and some of you may not know Jonathan

00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,330
field he's got a great podcast he was

00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,790
the guy that started the yoga studio

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:18,090
right after 9/11 in downtown Manhattan

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,410
who's already Braves and he has runs

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,170
podcast and they start talking about

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,450
lifestyle changes and choices and she

00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:28,410
shares with Jonathan that after several

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:30,840
years she's no longer vegan as a matter

00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:33,810
of fact she's been eating meat because

00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,610
the doctors have told her she has to so

00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,650
out of confusion and guilt she hasn't

00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,560
really been talking about it but she

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,810
still supports the vegan and vegetarian

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,100
community with and again I don't know

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,000
how much you know about the vegan

00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,660
community but they're pretty militant

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,840
person I think they don't need to be

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:54,810
tied down and fed bacon because bacon is

00:37:51,840 --> 00:38:00,270
God's way of saying I love you I really

00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:02,450
do yes yeah so I'm now managing all her

00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:05,550
social media at the time and these

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:09,420
unkind very militant people had some

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:11,580
very specific opinions on her lifestyle

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,740
choices so again coming out of the

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,750
divorce rebuilding her brand and then

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,000
another sucker punch to the teeth when

00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,910
she decides to be honest so let's talk

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,770
about how she want him back okay

00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,590
Alex wrote a book called women food and

00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,870
desire and from that she started to

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:31,610
podcasts her rules radio and crave cast

00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:35,370
and you can see by both her Twitter and

00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:38,190
obviously her her website how everything

00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,690
kind of pulls itself together now Alex I

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,610
think you're from Portland Alex Williams

00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,730
will be talking about this

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,960
so is she her mother and a Beth I had

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,970
the wonderful opportunity of speaking at

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,580
world domination summit with Alex on

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:52,820
stage her mother Annabeth had started

00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:54,260
her own organic like cooking and farming

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,480
and that kind of thing back in the 70s

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,950
her own radio show before anybody was a

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,360
granola out there right although

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:03,080
Portland is kind of known for being

00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,940
crunchy um and she was battling her

00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,850
second battle with with breast cancer

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,500
and had told you know everybody around

00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,790
her I don't want to go the chemotherapy

00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,400
route I've already done that I want to

00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:15,020
try to do it naturally I had the

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,970
opportunity to meet Annabeth and she was

00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,410
amazing

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:22,250
shortly after world domination summit

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:25,540
Annabeth lost her life to cancer rather

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,680
than stick her head in the sand

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,870
Alexandra decided to write about it and

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,460
she realized that other people might be

00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,260
in mourning too or depressed for

00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,440
whatever reason or bipolar or whatever

00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,480
right so she created recipes for people

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,850
who suffer with depression or are in

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,590
mourning and began to blog about it and

00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,850
put a video next to it and saying hey

00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,540
I'm hurting too and this is what's

00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:50,330
happening by doing that not only did we

00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,030
gain most of her followers back but we

00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:55,190
also exponentially grew her personal

00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:58,700
brand she's written another book right

00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:01,940
so this is what happened she wound up

00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:04,310
blending in health magazine in Elle

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,030
online as well as Oprah and Elle

00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:10,010
magazine offline her book woman food and

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,000
desire got very close to New York Times

00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,130
bestseller list

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,990
she got a read Hoda and Kathie Lee

00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:17,030
anybody watch NBC I see a couple of nods

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:20,620
yeah and then also on the dr. Oz Show

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:24,110
with none other than Ruth Westheimer and

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,580
also how your body craves food and how

00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:27,560
women desire certain things during

00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:31,610
certain times in their life their day of

00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,110
the year ultimately what she did was she

00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,140
used the things that she was most

00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:39,140
passionate about she used her folly just

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,360
like Martha Stewart to reinvent her

00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:44,680
brand now I'm going to jump into the six

00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,680
things you can do John

00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:57,860
brilliant number one on your name right

00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,320
Brian cannon said it best your name is

00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,940
your reputation a lot of you in here

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,620
saying well my name is John Smith and

00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm a programmer there's lots of John

00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,550
Smith's that are programmers well maybe

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,040
you're John Smith programmer that loves

00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,480
cats

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,690
okay and what I mean by that is that

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,980
it's okay to go out and buy a URL for

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,260
something that has something to do with

00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,000
you I work with people all the time they

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,160
have an executive job but then they have

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,050
a passion project you know maybe they're

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,940
the head of IT at their company but

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,070
they're also really loving robotics or

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,540
gaming so they have a business card I've

00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,100
had them do this where they have the

00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,860
front is what they do during the day

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,080
and then the back of the card or when

00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,280
you flip it over it simply says this is

00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,560

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,410
giving you some gravitas Woody Allen

by using Twitter Lizer and if you have a

00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,030
you don't think you're very visual

00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,460
person but you want to start creating

like infographics or putting things out

00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,170

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,560
comfortable blogging on LinkedIn blog on

00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,820
medium you know earlier when I was

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,680
asking how many of you aren't LinkedIn

00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:29,540
and how many on github how many of you

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:33,480
are on Korra okay about 30% of the room

00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,820
core is a great way to get ideas to

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,680
write a medium post right and if that

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,810
medium post winds up being you know

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,600
looked at or shared then maybe you pull

00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,850
it into your LinkedIn okay but creating

00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,110
content is so easy earlier when I asked

00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,340
how many people on Instagram and I know

00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,250

you are on Instagram by the way okay

00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,290
maybe about 25 30 percent of the room

00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,140
Arthur Brisbane in 1912 he's a famous

00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:01,620

picture's worth a thousand words video

00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,390
is worth a million if you're not using

00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,670
Instagram right now or something that's

00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:12,360
visually oriented people are not going

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,260
to want to mess with you use it i vlog

00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,119
on it on a cage

00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,830
sometimes I take pictures of what I'm

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,410
doing during my day what-have-you but

00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,359
it's a great medium specifically if

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,100
you're somebody in IT and you're going

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,109
to meet up events or you're going to an

00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,730
event that may be like this you know a

00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:28,590
convention or a conference that has to

00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,720
do with your area of expertise it's a

00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:34,560
great way to draw people toward you and

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,960
Instagram again free what was her name

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,850

god you're so lucky

00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:46,619
the next thing consistency you blog you

00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:48,990
post you tweet you have to be consistent

00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:51,330
right I always tell people that if they

00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,920
start a blog it's really good to make it

00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:54,690
part of their newsletter and if that

00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,310
newsletter goes out every Thursday at

00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,140
10:00 a.m. that blog post has to go up

00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,050
at the same time does that make sense

00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,420
right you have to be consistent it's

00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,730
really important and I think you know

00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,830
really Martha Stewart does a very good

00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,720
job when she talks about consistency and

00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,780
personal branding I pick on her a little

00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,560
bit because boy has she been through it

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,470
she said something that I thought was

00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,869
great personal branding you know can

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,540
outweigh lastly have a strategy and here

00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:23,070
the six five got one more for you right

00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,430
she said something I thought was really

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:29,040
brilliant you know personal branding can

00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,900
pull your audience a little bit more you

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,100
know closer to you and and what I'll say

00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,570
to you is that by putting all of this

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,000
out there I know you think it's a lot of

00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,380
work and after a time it may seem like

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,510
that but after a time it's going to be

00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,520
so easy because it becomes part of the

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,200
set of success rhythms of your life what

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,119
it does is it pulls people toward you

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,460
right it makes you that digital thought

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,300
leader it gives you a nice footprint she

00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,210
said something I thought was great

00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,760
identify your passion invest in yourself

00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,140
figure out what you need to know all of

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,970

I'm learning every day okay if you don't

00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,359
you've not learning you're not living

00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,460
and as you begin to learn take people on

00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,990
your journey what would you know what is

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,790
the kind of experience that you need to

00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,250
develop to do the things that you feel

00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:11,010
in your heart you know you'll enjoy and

00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:13,260
that will with help sustain you both

00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,550
mentally and economically each and every

00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:17,070
one of you in here has a passion for

00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:19,080
tech some of it takes form and

00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:21,210
programming or robotics or mobile

00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,920
applications or what have you but you

00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,869
know what I'll say to you is that it's

00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,460
so important that you take that thing

00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,339
that makes you special

00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,720
and promote that again as I said earlier

00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:32,730
people can't see inside of us they don't

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,800
know you know what we're about what our

00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,020
mores and our culture and our values are

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,450
but we can draw them to us

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,500
by being a part of the conversation and

00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:46,920
I'm gonna leave you with one bonus

00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:49,080

00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,260
yourself but there's potentially

anything online social media etc because

00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:15,279
the problem for some people is it's very

00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,289
hard to get out of a habit of not

00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:18,849
telling anyone anything because you

00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:22,119

00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:27,519

growing your personal brand Lisa you

00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,679
have to be fearless I have people on

both sides of the political coin and

00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,729

somebody comments negatively you'll see

00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,430

00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,580
biggest thing I mean imagine what Alex

that properly thank you what's your

00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,310
question Kristen well my question has to

00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:07,350
do with like say okay you were talking

00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:12,030
about being consistent and blogging and

00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:16,170
everything what if is okay is it

00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:16,920
acceptable to like at one blog and not

00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,040
write anymore

00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,050
again a commitment to be doing this all

00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,630
the time because it just sounds like I'd

00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,460
run out of material I I knew not a

00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,550
writer's block - yeah

00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,930
so I write for a lot of my clients and I

00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,820
also have a team of people who work with

00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:33,930
me that that help with that I understand

00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,000
exactly what you're saying

00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,130
maybe blogging is not your bag Kristen

00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,690
and you wind up deciding that I'm just

00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,970
gonna tweet or I'm just going to

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,500
Instagram right but if you do it you do

00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,840
need to be consistent you know if you're

00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,300
blogging I would say blogging at least

00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,950
you know twice a month to start and then

00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,260
slowly but surely once a week it's only

00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,430
gonna help you get noticed everybody

00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,980
here knows how Google works right

00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,420
children okay great so when they're and

00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,220
you've got a really unique and lovely

00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,720
name Kristen hybl I mean it's not like

00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,850
your name Mary Smith no offense to any

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,980
Mary Smith's in the room but that being

00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,280
said you'll wind up showing up a little

00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,870
bit

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,440
or when people are searching out your

00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:12,090
expertise and perhaps also you know what

00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,950
you are there to blog about and guys

00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,900
it's okay not to just blog about your

00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,210
industry blog about stuff that you're

00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,950
facing at work ideas that you're

00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,450
bouncing around if you can you know

00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,950
legally because some people work for

00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,200
publicly traded companies and you can

00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:26,430
but it's located to open up the kimono

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,310
you know when I started my presentation

00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:32,100
the first thing I did was say look I'm

00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:33,480
not a technologist you know but I speak

00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,340
to a lot of technologists and I work

00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,680
with the ton of them you know I come

00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:39,690
from a law enforcement background if my

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,160
late George didn't die in 1999 I

00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,560
probably would still be somewhere in

00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,420
Quantico Virginia Washington DC working

00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,770
with you know forensic psychologists

00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,690
trying to figure out you know when the

00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,900
next terrorist attacks gonna happen so

00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:53,190
that being said our lives aren't like

00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,780
this they're not a straight line when I

00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:56,160
ask somebody if you got it all figured I

00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,800
don't know one person raised a hand I

00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,690
know that she was just toying with me

00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,820
none of us have this figured out right

00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:05,610
the more personal the more authentic

00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,940
that you can be the better make sense

00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:10,350
can I get an amen okay brilliant

00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,970
any other questions because I do want to

00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:13,140
be mindful of the that I only have this

00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,300

ways to engage Facebook Twitter

00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,630
Instagram to me it just seems like a

00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,700
tremendous amount of work to manage all

00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:50,190
of those and be creating content for all

00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,320
of them do you use any platforms that

00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:55,590
helps you streamline that or share them

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,750
your tribe is if most of them are on

00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,700
Korra or on github or on LinkedIn focus

00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:11,000
on that start building it out there

00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,700
don't invest in tools Brandon right

00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,440
unless you know you're ready to actually

00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,720
jump in with both feet start that blog

00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,050
create a Twitter following you know have

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,520
your

00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,380
YouTube channel where you talk about

00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:24,210
programming or whatever right it's

00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,950
really important that you start first

00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,660
with your tribe one of the great things

00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,710
that the young lady in the in the back

00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,300
was talking about when she was talking

00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:32,580
about editing and also having a video

00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,260
stop sending your content out to friends

00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,430
what do you think about this I'm

00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,650
thinking about posting this on medium

00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:39,840
right start small

00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:42,000
before you invest a lot of cash right

00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,010
and see where people respond to you

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,440
right and here's the thing it may be

00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:48,060
much or they respond to you don't you

00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,610
know get down on yourself or or down on

00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:52,110
the content we all all of us right when

00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:54,150
I asked earlier how many are on computer

00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,550
9:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday 100%

00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:58,650
of the hands came up right they see

00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:00,270
7,000 brand images a day how are they

00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,950
gonna remember you as number 4 you've

00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,390
got to get out in front of them so maybe

00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,740
writing the blog post and then tweeting

00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:06,630
it out or posting it on your Linkedin

00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,580
might be the initial way to start right

00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:10,830
but find out where your tribe is first

00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:14,610
and stop posting there does that answer

00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:18,450
