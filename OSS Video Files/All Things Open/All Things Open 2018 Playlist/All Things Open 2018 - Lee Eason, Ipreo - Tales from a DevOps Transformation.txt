	00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:08,429
hey everybody

00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:12,630
whoo thanks for hanging around it's the

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,460
end of the day most of the time we're

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,590
done right really go home I'm gonna go

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,029
get a drink at the bar and I went to the

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,560
last session but I didn't really but you

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,330
guys are faithful you stayed I'm

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,390
impressed

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,650
my name is Li Eason and I'm super

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,470
excited to talk to you about DevOps

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,539
today I was just joking with some former

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,610
colleagues of mine about how a few years

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,489
ago when I interviewed for this position

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,730
for director of DevOps I had no idea

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,110
what DevOps was no idea have any of you

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,600
ever interviewed for a position you're

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,590
like I don't actually know what this is

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,579
yes awesome so for the last three and a

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,670
half years I've been at this company

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,170
called Ipreo I pre was a financial

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,780
technology company yeah we're gonna edit

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,910
that out of the video by the way I pre

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,430
was a financial technology company so we

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,350
we had about 30 different products that

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,750
we sold to the financial markets that

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,820
did all kind of thing so we we sold some

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,710
products to municipalities they would

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,360
raise bond raise you know bond raising

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,040
initiatives are so there's software

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,920
somewhere that manages that and we we

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,479
built that software so 98% of municipal

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,970
bond raising in the u.s. happens on our

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,040
platform that's like pretty serious

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,680
market domination we also sold software

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,200
to big banks like Merrill Lynch and Bank

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,330
of America Wells Fargo and they use our

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
software to take companies public so

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,400
they manage the IPO process on our

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,890
platform so like a lot of ass majority

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,619
of IPOs happen on our software for that

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,450
as well so Facebook Alibaba snapchat

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,280
most of time when you hear about these

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,750
tech IPOs they're happening on Ipreo

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
software so we're one of those players

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,890
is sort of behind the scenes but nobody

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,360
knows who we are we also have products

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,920
for private companies that help them do

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,840
things like track of their valuation

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,670
sort of like figuring out what to list

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,159
your house at like what criteria do you

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,450
use for that it's sort of complicated

00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:59,219
and keep track of things like stock

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,740
options who's ever had like equity

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,390
allocations and a startup all right

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,430
that's surprisingly hard to keep track

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,770
of and I'm sure you'd appreciate it if

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,200
the CEO would do that so we we create

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,120
software that your CFO your CEO uses to

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,890
keep track of equity allocations and

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,900
then we got bought over

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,650
the summer by this company called IHS

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,620
market and so we went from having 30

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,260
financial services products to 60 and

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,810
now there's 500 end-user facing

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,660
applications that do all kinds of crazy

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,490
stuff like figure out the cell phone

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,490
reception quality of different carriers

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,050
and also transport oil from this place

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,340
to this place it's all over the place

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,800
really exciting so my goal for today is

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,940
to talk to you about this transformation

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,530
that I've been leading I peer through

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,230
over the last three years three and a

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,720
half years I want you to leave here with

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,150
a better understanding about what it

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,880
means to try and change the way that

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,220
lots of people go about doing their jobs

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,290
and that's what a DevOps transformation

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,060
really is so we're gonna be talking a

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,620
lot about people today I hope you're ok

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,060
with that and we can't really get

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,950
started on this until we have a good

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,170
understanding about what DevOps is so

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,940
everybody that gives DevOps talks gets

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,340
to share their definition I'm not gonna

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,880
pass up my opportunity to do that DevOps

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,180
is about continuously improving your

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,430
technical processes really at the end of

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,110
the day when I hear about companies

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,630
going through a DevOps transformation

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,790
what you're really doing is you're

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:36,650
dealing with habits that have been built

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,390
up over the last 5 to 10 to 20 years

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,079
that have been reinforced by annual

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,170
bonuses by executive performance reviews

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,790
and beit's so solidly into the way that

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,220
people think that they no longer

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,769
consciously think they just do and

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,299
you're confronting these habits when

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,040
you're dealing with enterprise DevOps

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,100
transformations you're you're trying to

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,480
uncover that story why do people do the

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,910
things that they do and how can I get

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
them to act differently it's not an easy

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,620
problem to solve ok

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,380
it's actually really painful anybody in

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,750
here a long-distance runner

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,209
are you crazy bastards so I run too but

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,979
only because I have to running is

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,709
painful most people don't run most

00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,840
people like hate exercising we do it

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,849
though because we know there's a

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,340
positive outcome on the back side of it

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,000
it's amazing humans will endure a lot of

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,190
pain

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,890
if they understand and believe that the

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,420
benefit is gonna be worth it right so

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,800
when I'm talking to people and trying to

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,530
coach them about big scale

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,720
organizational changes it's painful we

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,460
need to be realistic about that but the

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,650
payoff is worth it

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,020
so this is what the payoff looks like

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,940
for Ipreo when I joined the company

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,460
three and a half years ago we had a

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,980
centralized release management team that

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,070
would take in tickets from all of our

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,080
different 65 or 70 some-odd application

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,540
development teams those tickets were

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,580
called RFC's and they would execute

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,669
those changes to do things like release

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,470
my application version 5.6 in to QA or

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,630
release my application into production

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,370
or make this database change or drop

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,550
this dll here or get me these logs from

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,310
this server right we did over 900 of

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,840
those types of things every month and if

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,030
you looked at the amount of time those

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:25,350
tickets stayed open it added up to over

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,200
350 days per month that's a lot of

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,150
friction right we want those things to

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,460
be easy and painless we want to do them

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,750
often and yet we had this process in

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,750
place that was painful and

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,400
time-consuming okay so at the end of

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,530
this transformation when we look at the

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,470
way I prio does things today we do

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,780
almost no of manual work like that and

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,360
the number of days of delay is down to

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,800
essentially zero that's a tremendous

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,229
amount of change over three and a half

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,340
years and it's really hundreds of people

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:58,710
changing their behaviors if we think

00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,820
about the way that that change has to go

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,530
in right so let's think about the

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,120
details of this a little bit we had to

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,580
take a release management team and

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,260
change what they were essentially remove

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,400
them so we can't have a release

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,979
management team we can't have that

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,290
central bottleneck anymore the answer to

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,970
our problem wasn't just new tools that's

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,620
why I'm so glad that the DevOps

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,540
conversation has evolved beyond just

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,970
talking about tools because that's

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,140
really not what it is right if I just

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,910
given new tools to the release

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,520
management team we would not have taken

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,680
those 350 days of delay out of our

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,650
monthly work it would have been a small

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,419
incremental improvement what we had to

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,729
do is we had to change the operating

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,960
model of the company we needed to change

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,300
the release management team and

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,449
transform it into a internal tools team

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,849
manages a toolbox of tools that provides

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:48,250
a capability that all of our application

00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:50,020
development teams consume to pursue

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,610
their own DevOps journey right and again

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,080
what is DevOps it's continuous

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,270
improvement of the code build and deploy

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,520
process so that's something that your

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,069
dev teams have to do and they are

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,110
enabled to do that by an internal tools

00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,210
team in that toolbox and they're taught

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,220
how to do it by that internal tools team

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,020
who manages that toolbox but they have

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,789
to do the work that's a big shift in

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,050
thinking it's much harder to do than

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:12,310
just trying to change how the release

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,949
management team does their work right

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,969
because now I'm dealing with dozens and

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,979
dozens of teams instead of just one so

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,810
as we think a little bit more about what

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,659
is the how does the value of that type

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,789
of organizational shift manifest right

00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:30,699
we talked about manual work but route

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,879
calls discovery is massively faster than

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,770
it used to be when we think about what

00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,069
does that enable men actually get my

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,280
business ok so back in three and a half

00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,289
years ago remember we were doing 900

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,090
tasks per month with all that friction

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,310
what do we get for that what's my return

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,690
on that we could barely deploy our

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,090
applications a hundred times a month

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,630
across all environments 30 applications

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,889
across all their different dev QA demo

00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,529
tests performance testing production

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,900
that's not very much right it's really

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,000
difficult to actually innovate at the

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,370
right pace we're gonna talk more about

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,680
that in a second today we can deploy we

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,770
deploy regularly today over 9000 times

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,330
per month so it's not like one-to-one

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,580
it's not like I'm still deploying at the

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,129
same rate that change enabled my

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,529
business to move so much faster than it

00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,719
was able to before we're refactoring our

00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,400
legacy applications faster here's a

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,599
newsflash for you when something's

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,099
really difficult we don't do it that

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,379
often right that's sort of a core

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:31,150
principle of automation and DevOps so

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,010
when it's easy to deploy changes to

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,990
production suddenly I'm not so scared to

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,909
start refactoring legacy applications

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,169
because it's not going to be as painful

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:43,390
as it was going to be otherwise we're

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,089
also talking about things like quality

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,920
and Net Promoter scores so for us it was

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,140
a twenty four percent drop in seven and

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,610
two defects and when we look at Net

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,550
Promoter scores across all of our

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,339
different lines of business

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,290
the teams that are the furthest along on

00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,180
their DevOps journeys the ones that are

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,459
doing things like zero downtime releases

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,529
and I've figured out their database

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,540
automation properly and are deploying

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,100
more frequently their customers are

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,440
happier than other areas of our business

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,630
and by the way this is all sort of

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,640
predicted by the puppet state of DevOps

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,620
report if you look at that data it's

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,089
pretty clear that these are the types of

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,680
benefits you're gonna see so it's been

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,940
really neat for me to watch I Prius

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,160
transformation over the last three years

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,560
really track right along with what the

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,600
industry sort of said and that was

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,130
actually a big part of getting buy-in

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,010
for some of these changes talk more

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,510
about that in a second so we've

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,220
understood the value right there's a

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,300
these are things I think probably

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,970
everybody in this room is pretty

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,640
familiar with but the reality for Ipreo

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,800
is very much there right reduction in

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,470
manual work led to faster throughput

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,029
better velocity higher quality blah blah

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,800
blah we get that stuff all right but

00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:50,810
what made it hard what were the things

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,950
that were the hardest things for us to

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,990
deal with what were the big boulders

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,790
that I had to push through that we had

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,450
to push through so there's kind of three

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,220
things we're going to talk about

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,490
executives culture and we're gonna talk

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,339
about team health so first of all

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,630
executives don't understand DevOps and

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,339
that's actually okay that's to be

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,890
expected why don't they understand

00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,300
DevOps the bigger the organization the

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,560
further the separation between your

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,540
business leaders and the direct

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,490
contributors right and in a really big

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,160
organization that's like a Gulf of

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,920
Mexico size thing it's it's a huge

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,300
separation even if your executives have

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,339
a technology background which they

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,760
probably don't they probably have a

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:30,770
background and Finance legal accounting

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,060
sales that's typically where your

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,680
business senior business leadership

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,290
comes from but even if they have a

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,899
technology background the landscape of

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,880
technology changes so fast that in my

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,370
experience actually it's more of a

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,959
detriment than a helper I have a harder

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,089
time dealing with business executives

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,529
who purportedly have technology

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,720
backgrounds because they're dangerous

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,579
they think they know what's going on but

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,410
they don't because the world that they

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:57,050
grew up in is so radically different

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,060
today than it was then right so it's

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,709
like I think I understand your world but

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,899
you really don't so I spend more time

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,730
trying to help them understand what's

00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,180
real today than I do someone who starts

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,300
from zero

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,560
that separation is actually okay that's

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,530
an okay thing and you should embrace

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,910
that don't fret too much over the fact

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,200
that these folks aren't technologists

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,710
that's not their job that's your job

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,720
okay now some of my colleagues would

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,120
I've heard them say like listen you're

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,860
wasting your time with the executives

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,660
all they need to know is that you're

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,210
here to fix the release process and

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,530
actually when I first joined Ipreo

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,600
three-and-a-half years ago that's what

00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,370
exactly what our executives thought they

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,990
said Oh Lee's coming in to fix the

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,720
release process and I could have just

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,700
stopped there that's sort of true right

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,700
that's that's technically true we are

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,740
gonna improve the release process but

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,830
here's the problem with stopping there

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,470
the problem is when your delivery teams

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,840
have a deployment error and that story

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,000
bubbles up to those business executives

00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,560
what are they going to hear what they

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,540
understand is that you're there to fix

00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,910
the release process when they hear that

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,860
you broke it and made it worse that's

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,750
where you get really fun declarations

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,610
and laws that get issued and those

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,010
declarations look ridiculous to a

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,390
technologist it's like you can't deploy

00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,760
code until it's sat on the repository

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,710
for 24 hours that's a real rule that

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
I've heard in some companies right other

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,460
rules are like the only people that can

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,260
deploy code to production is the release

00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,060
management team we pay these people to

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,290
deploy code to production why are the

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,000
application teams deploying their own

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,710
code to production that seems broken and

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,270
they can't do it right and so we're

00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,380
gonna let the professionals deploy code

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,180
to production I don't care what they do

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,410
in the other environments Lee can go do

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,089
whatever he wants to over there but when

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,820
it comes to production that's the

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,650
release management teams job so when

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,480
those declarations happen the issue is

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,589
you've lost credibility because you've

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,240
been going around talking to the

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,220
delivery teams and painting this great

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,660
picture and this great story about what

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,610
things are going to be like after we get

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,680
through this change but you can't follow

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,420
through on it and the the executives are

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,530
sort of cut you out from cut your legs

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,720
out from under you right you've lost

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,220
credibility those delivery teams aren't

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,990
going to trust you anymore because

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,940
you've proven to them that you don't

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,950
have the support and buy-in of business

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,680
leadership so your job has just gotten a

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,110
lot harder it's much easier to build

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,780
credibility ahead of time build support

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,670
ahead of time than it is after the fact

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,440
after an incident like that and I've

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,910
seen this happen at Ipreo we've had to

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,800
ploy incidents everybody has deploy

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,030
incidents it's going to happen if you

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,020
change something you're going to break

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,120
it every once in a while

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,760
so making sure that they understand how

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,500
you're fixing the release process what

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,330
that process is going to look like is

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,130
really important to keep their support

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,870
through that transition okay

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,950
there's kind of two key areas I want you

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,920
to think about when you're dealing with

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,900
executives number one challenge

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,330
constraints don't ignore them

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,450
like I said most of your business

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:49,839
executives have backgrounds in finance

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,760
or legal or sales when they raise an

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,200
objection like hey Lee you're talking

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,790
about giving people more access to

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,530
production than they have right now I

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,330
think we have contracts that are going

00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,890
to be a problem there don't say that's

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,020
not an issue we'll get around it like

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,150
that's not the right response the right

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,320
response is I understand that could be

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,640
an obstacle I'm actually already

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,220
partnering with our head of contracts

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,660
we're auditing our contracts and I'm

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,890
also partnering with our head of account

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,020
management to start having some

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,100
conversations with our key customers so

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,510
that they're aware of it because I

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,180
understand this is a relationship issue

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,200
as much as it's a contract issue what

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,750
you're doing is you're telling the

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,339
executive I get it I understand that

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,900
this is a potential problem and I

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,970
respect the fact that you've spent

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,620
decades of your life managing these

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,450
types of relationships and contracts and

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,089
I'm not going to ignore those things so

00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,890
you can trust me it's okay right turn

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,140
that kind of a objection into an

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,810
opportunity don't lose credibility by

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,790
ignoring it and I joke here that we have

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,480
def SEC ops so maybe we need def SEC

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,709
Regla glops

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,540
we can hashtag that another thing I want

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,740
you to think about is metrics all right

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,930
everybody talks about metrics they're

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,240
super important don't ignore metrics

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,040
never ignore metrics but the way that I

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,040
want you to frame metrics in your head

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,830
is metrics are an opportunity to build a

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,260
bridge between a business executive and

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,270
the delivery teams now like we've said

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,700
before delivery teams are dealing with

00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,770
technology that's rapidly evolving the

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,060
state of the tools and processes that

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,410
they're using today are radically

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,080
different than what they were even five

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,270
years ago okay so we can't expect

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,209
business executives to stay up to speed

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,100
with all those details metrics are an

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,839
opportunity to abstract them away from

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,000
those details and help them focus on the

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
things that matter that are common

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,050
between the delivery teams and the

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,089
executives I'll give you an example

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,950
you always start conversations about

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,839
change by trying to talk about what are

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,970
the goals what are the objectives where

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,170
is the pain point if you hear something

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,110
from an executive that sounds like

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,120
listen we started this company 10 years

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,920
ago 15 years ago we had no competition

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,680
there was nobody else in our space

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,269
nobody did what we do but today we have

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
all these new competitors popping up it

00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,000
seems like every other week I'm hearing

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,760
about somebody else trying to do this

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,680
and they're out innovating us our teams

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,480
can't keep up it takes too long for us

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,130
to get changes into production and our

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,290
customers are constantly asking us about

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,269
these things that these capabilities or

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,980
competitors can do but we can't do and

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:10,480
it's taking too long for us to get stuff

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,339
done and we have too many quality issues

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,170
and I'm feeling the heat from our

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:17,860
competitors ok

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:20,290
you understand this confluence of

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,320
business and technology your job is to

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,820
listen to that story and figure out what

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,529
are the behaviors what are the things

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,930
happening on our teams that are

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,850
contributing to that story and what are

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,440
the metrics I can put in front of this

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,120
business executive that my team will

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,370
understand and this person will

00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,440
understand and care about so in that

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,410
story our metrics that we're gonna focus

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,220
in on are what lead time and defect

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,570
escapes right you know what the

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,399
behaviors are you know what the

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,870
inhibiting things are on your team's

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,700
that are keeping them from improving

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,890
those metrics so you can go off and

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,290
focus on those activities the executives

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,399
don't necessarily need to know all that

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,529
but they do need to understand those

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,480
metrics and those things become your key

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,829
performance indicators when you go to

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,660
the team you tell them the same story

00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:06,640
don't tell them a different story you

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,319
sit down and say listen folks

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,390
ten years ago here's what here was the

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,860
state but this is where we are today and

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,929
here's the metrics that we're gonna use

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:19,030
as our North Star that's gonna guide us

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:21,939
to a better outcome all right so let's

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,800
talk more about that you've got

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,790
executive buy-in now you understand and

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,020
you've got a good relationship with your

00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,669
executives you know it's important to

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,500
them you've got some metrics that

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,850
they're bought into they understand how

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,470
those metrics affect the business

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,450
outcomes now you're starting to deal

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,520
with the delivery teams I'm really

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,800
excited like I said in DevOps we've made

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,770
this shift and we're no longer hyper

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,570
focusing on toolboxes which is good

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,490
we're starting to talk about behaviors

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,510
here's the thing

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,910
this is what I've observed and this

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,300
might be controversial I think tech

00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,380
people suck at influencing behaviors and

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,080
the reason for that is because I think

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,640
most tech people think that getting

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,690
someone else to change their behaviors

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:04,330
is a dirty icky process right I felt

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,860
that way I still feel that way in fact

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,690
the day that I realized I was a Salesman

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,630
and no longer a tech person I like took

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:14,020
a really long hot shower like to try and

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,750
scrub off the salesmanship but the fact

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,880
of the matter is the root word of the

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,179
word managed and the root word of the

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,640
word manipulate are the same word often

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:27,850
times the difference between those two

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,130
things is just an what's motivating the

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,740
person who's doing the influencing right

00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,929
your job is to influence the behavior of

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,309
other people if you don't feel like

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,050
that's something that you want to do

00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,440
then you're not a change agent and

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,970
that's okay but don't try and devote

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,290
yourself to being a change agent if

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,700
you're not interested in understanding

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,720
how people think and influencing their

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,190
behaviors okay so when we're dealing

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,510
with this kind of stuff we've got to

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,570
kind of get into the psychology of how

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,429
people work most rational people behave

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,059
according to their values there's some

00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,620
inset you know collection of values that

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:04,660
they've developed over the years that

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,130
governs their behavior most people

00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,630
aren't aware of these things and

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,160
certainly when you get to an engineering

00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,170
department and an enterprise company

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,860
that's 10 20 years old there's very

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,150
rarely gonna be like a nice aligned

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,710
everybody's bought into this set of

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,510
engineering values that governs our

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,880
decisions that's not generally how it

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:25,110
works those things typically get backed

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,070
into over years and years and years so

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,720
you've got to start to tease those

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,730
things out you're almost like a forensic

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,950
detective you're trying to figure out

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,809
what are the values that are driving the

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,090
behavior of my engineering teams

00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,800
software and infrastructure how did they

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,250
get to those things what's the story all

00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,720
right so I'll give you an example of one

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,520
let's talk about efficiency and cost

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,690
saving by the way I like to put values

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,820
in contrast to one another because

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,360
sometimes that helps people understand

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,210
what I'm talking about

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,130
so here's a story for you companies

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,679
started and they're scrappy

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,940
right in the beginning there's not a lot

00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,450
of money I think people sometimes

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,760
general

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,050
think companies just have infinite money

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,580
oh we're running low on money well let's

00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,750
just go raise some well it's not that

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,460
easy that's not how it works

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,080
companies have checkbooks they have

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,370
finite amount of money they have the

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,990
same problems you have when you're

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,490
trying to manage your personal finances

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,500
at home when your air conditioning

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,940
breaks like mine did this summer it

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,830
sucks you don't have the cash for it

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,720
guess what you're gonna be hot right

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,860
companies are the same way so if they

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,780
have this new product they're trying to

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,700
bring to the market and they think they

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,840
have some buyers for it right they've

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,460
got some people that have like letters

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,200
of intent yeah I'll buy it if you have

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,510
this thing but you got to get it into

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,620
production first and you spend all these

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,330
months on a research and development

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,650
you've written all this code and now

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,810
you're trying to get that thing out into

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,370
production so you go to the engineering

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,920
teams and you say hey folks we've got

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,750
this code I need five back-end servers I

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,240
need a sequel server cluster I need

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,100
these offline workers I need this cueing

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,560
system and the engineering guys like

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,840
well that's gonna cost you know seventy

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,150
five thousand dollars and capex for new

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,380
servers and hardware well guess what

00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,000
we don't have seventy five thousand

00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,380
dollars in fact if we don't get this

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,840
product into production we're not gonna

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,820
make payroll in three months so you

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,860
don't have capex you've got to figure

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,300
out some way to get that product in

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,090
production with what you have on the

00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,520
Shelf right now right so the engineering

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,350
guys pull off a miracle and they they

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,210
get that application running on all the

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,740
existing hardware so you've got IAS

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,570
servers that are running multiple sites

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,640
you've got a sequel server cluster with

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,980
multiple databases you've got one load

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,510
balancer serving all this traffic right

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,450
you got one queueing system and all the

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:31,150
workers for multiple applications and

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,560
it's a rat's nest but it worked when you

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,660
got the thing out into production you

00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:38,530
sign the contracts you save the day

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,970
company grows awesome great work how

00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,810
many times do you go back and fix that

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,440
problem never right never go back and

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,000
fix it

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,290
because then there's the next thing that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,420
comes up and you got to get the next

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,000
product if you play that movie for five

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,640
years how fun is it going to be to work

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,390
on that engineering department it's not

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,430
gonna be fun

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,960
right and who's supporting that crap

00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,370
it's the engineers right they're the

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,850
ones that are on call it's a miserable

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:06,970
experience nobody sat down and said I

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,440
really wanted to suck to work here all

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,150
right nobody was like you know what

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,770
would be really great is tight

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,660
dependencies on our

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,520
your lair that should be our engineering

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,560
value number one tight dependencies

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,470
tight coupling nobody does that

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,360
you back into those values over years

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,560
and years and years and those kinds of

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,920
situations that come up again and again

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,220
and again it's not like anybody had a

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,490
bad intention or mismanaged anything

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,540
it's just a reality okay

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,190
understanding that story is going to

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,230
make you a much more effective change

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,570
agent than someone who comes in and

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,480
throws stones if you're joining an

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,610
organization as a change agent do

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,920
yourself a really big favor and never

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,870
make fun of your predecessors never poke

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,700
holes in it don't mock decisions that

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,870
were made before you got there trust

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,310
that those things were made with the

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,750
best of intentions and people did the

00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,260
best they could with what they had at

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,870
the time

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,580
you will gain much more credibility and

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,800
reputation or capital with your

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,720
co-workers if you operate that way it's

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,720
really tempting not to but don't

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,110
understanding these values is going to

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,850
give you a really strong position to

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,910
start to have conversations about why

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:21,040
you need to change behaviors okay so as

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,260
you tell these stories and you're

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,270
working with the engineering teams I did

00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,220
being able to identify these things and

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,600
be very clear about these things and say

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,210
listen this is the state of the company

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,190
this is how this situation came to be as

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,250
it is this is the behaviors that led to

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,440
that but look folks congratulations on

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,970
growing the company to this point but we

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,620
are not going to hit this next level of

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,350
scaling if we continue to operate this

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,450
way so whereas before we may have valued

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,980
getting something out the door at the

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,600
expense of quality because we didn't

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,370
have competitors and we could afford to

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,340
make mistakes we can't do that anymore

00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,230
we have to value quality above speed now

00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,910
because otherwise our competitors are

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:01,320
going to snap up our customers from us

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:06,190
because we're giving them so much

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,670
ammunition to use against us being able

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,710
to codify what the values were put a

00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,810
stake in the ground and then codify what

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,640
the values need to be they give you this

00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,260
common platform to start to drive a

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,930
bunch of behavioral changes across your

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,310
organization team autonomy and

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,780
centralized process is another really

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,790
great contention point for a lot of

00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,299
enterprises centralized processes are

00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,999
really

00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,830
they're really safe it's something that

00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,860
people can wrap their heads around it's

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,239
also a Productivity killer oftentimes so

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,950
in places where you don't need those

00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,049
centralized processes trust team

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,730
autonomy over that but you're gonna have

00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:41,499
to be able to sell that story to people

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,570
and you need to be able to frame it and

00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:45,519
that sort of here was our old values

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,019
here's what they produced here's what

00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,549
you're saying we need to achieve and

00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,619
here's the values that are gonna get us

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:52,749
there and now let's start to think about

00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:57,489
the behaviors that are going to come

00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:59,139
from this new value structure now one

00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,059
thing I want you to keep in mind as you

00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:02,409
as we deal with values and principles

00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:04,840
it's all very fuzzy right there's no

00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:06,549
laws we're not past the intent

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,470
Commandments and then writing a bunch of

00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:09,340
knock-on laws from that right that's not

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,409
what we're doing we're dealing with

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,389
principles and values these things are

00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,429
not free-for-all tickets there's still a

00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,590
finite amount of money so even though we

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:19,749
might say hey listen we value team

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,059
efficiency over spending money in other

00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:24,340
words we're fine spending money if it

00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:26,080
gets us some team efficiency there's

00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,090
still a limit there's like a finite

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,090
amount of money to spend so you need to

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,070
spend it wisely be prudent with that

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,749
stuff we're going to talk more about

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,100
team capability in a minute but

00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:38,139
information security is another great

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,059
example you may have contracts that

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,840
actually limit who has access to certain

00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,519
types of data

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,619
don't just skirt around those things

00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,059
like we said don't ignore constraints

00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:51,009
figure out what those constraints are

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:52,779
and work around them and then one more

00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:55,179
thing I want to note here about metrics

00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:57,220
we said metrics are a great opportunity

00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:00,009
to build a bridge between business

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,649
executives and operational teams or

00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:04,899
delivery teams it's also a really great

00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,659
opportunity to reinforce your values

00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:09,940
think very carefully about those metrics

00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:12,759
and the values that they purport to

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,859
support I'll give you an example if you

00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:18,220
say that you value quality over

00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:21,159
everything else but you measure how many

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,679
hours your engineers estimated a task is

00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,450
going to take and you punish them when

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,850
they're off on that estimate what

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,989
message are you really sending are you

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,549
sending the message that you care about

00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:32,440
quality or are you sending the message

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,609
that you care about quality of estimates

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,460
and how many minutes you spent on a

00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:38,710
certain task right so your metrics

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,270
reinforce values and the

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,799
they send a very clear message to your

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,830
engineering team about what you really

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,870
care about be careful that you don't

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,850
have dissonance in that messaging in

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,230
other words don't say that you care

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,990
about one thing and then measure

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,909
something else that's opposite to that

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,260
right you've got to think really

00:26:54,909 --> 00:27:00,730
carefully and critically about those

00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,679
metrics okay last thing I want to talk

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,909
about here is team health now I'm gonna

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:05,980
be really honest here and say that this

00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:07,419
is something I did not value and really

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,909
understand when I started this process

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:15,940
that I Brio I kind of took for granted

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:17,529
that people would just evolve and you

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,500
know naturally learn everything would be

00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:24,640
masters of everything like I am I was a

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,070
joke it is actually really really

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,690
important to think about team capability

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,760
and team health as you're making all

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,049
these changes I actually just wrote an

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,250
article about this on LinkedIn if you

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:35,220
want to hear more of my thoughts on this

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,080
but the bottom line is that

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,870
transformation is the new normal right

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,340
this this idea that oh things will just

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,559
calm down once we get through this

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,570
public cloud migration No forget it man

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,549
because the technology that drives that

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,520
public cloud is changing faster than

00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,960
ever before and you will constantly be

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,340
having to learn new things and your

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,159
business will constantly be shifting

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,990
because of that technical capability so

00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,450
you need to embrace that chaos you need

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,460
to build processes that keep your teams

00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,399
healthy in the midst of all of this

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:07,929
constant change so let's walk through an

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,480
example of what this actually looks like

00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:12,520
so this is a example DevOps maturity

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,169
model never take somebody else's

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,000
maturity model and just use it without

00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,429
changing it make sure it's realistic for

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,380
your organization this is something

00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,659
we're actually working on right now at

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,309
IHS market but let's walk through this

00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,350
maturity model I just look except sort

00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:29,230
of that's let's see on this projector

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,820
it's sorta like a bluish color so let's

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:34,779
let's talk about this story alright so

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,700
in our maturity model here level one we

00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,169
have an engineer this is this is real

00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,480
stuff right let's think practically

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,370
there's an engineer a software engineer

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,649
on a team and we're saying listen

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,659
somebody on this team has got to update

00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,220
our build process we need an automated

00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:49,419
build process that's going to run every

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,279
time code gets checked in

00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:52,540
so there's somebody on a team who's

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,310
making a change give

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:59,740
an example made-up person Brett yeah

00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,340
Phoenix project nice so we got we got

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,630
Brett

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,720
all right so Brett is a software

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,040
developer he writes c-sharp and he's

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,030
like hey look I'll take this on it's

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,910
fine I'll figure out the build process

00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:12,100
so Brett goes off he takes the task he

00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,570
implements an automated build process he

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,790
gets the hooks built into the code

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,200
repository let's say he's using github

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,490
Enterprise or something and now he's got

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,590
those things connected together great

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,150
job Brett and the team says listen we

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,520
want to keep improving we care about

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,100
DevOps so level two what's that all

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,290
right well now Brett goes back into the

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,620
build system and he updates it so that

00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:35,110
it actually outputs docker image and it

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,760
gets stuck into artifactory or nexus or

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,470
something and it's version and there's

00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,660
metadata and it's beautiful and it gets

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,550
even like figure out how to tag it back

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,080
to the issue tracking system so you've

00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,500
got nice traceability between the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,300
versions right great job Brett then we

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,340
get to level three and we say hey listen

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,100
to get to level three we need to take

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,830
that automated image now that docker

00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:01,240
image and it needs to get deployed to QA

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:03,910
who's gonna do that work probably Brett

00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,470
right more than likely Brett's gonna do

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,760
that work and so he's gonna go in and

00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,050
now he's going to update and he's doing

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,060
a whole different kind of deployment

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,110
automation now this is not like build

00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,090
automation this is different kind of

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,000
automation so he's learning chef or

00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,200
ansible or something like that and he's

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,540
writing automation that's actually

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,630
deploying the app Brett's learning a lot

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,340
right the team is maturing through these

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,350
maturity levels but Brett is learning a

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,180
lot of cool stuff here the level for now

00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,710
immutable infrastructure he's thinking

00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,140
about Bluegreen deployments he's

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,940
thinking about infrastructure is code so

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,350
there's even more ansible more chef

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,210
where he's got am eyes getting built

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,220
automatically Brett is rocking and

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,530
rolling by the time he gets a level 5

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,540
Brett is like knocking it out of the

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,250
park this dude is a freakin genius and

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,410
the whole team is like holy cow we're

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:53,560
going so fast this is amazing and then

00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:56,140
what happens Brett gets a new job Brett

00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,900
takes a job as a senior principle DevOps

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,460
engineer down the street he's a block

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,220
away from where he was just working and

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,600
he just got a 30% raise right good for

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,250
Brett bad for the team

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,280
this is a real thing that happens all

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:12,410
the time how many times have you guys

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,360
been on a team and you've heard

00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,700
something like well we can't really

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,809
estimate that because you know John's on

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:24,650
vacation right this is what's actually

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:26,480
happening we're changing the DNA of the

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,160
team we're going in and we're saying

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
look there was all this stuff that other

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,490
people used to do right and now I want

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,679
you to do it and so we are changing the

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,960
the concerns and the skills that that

00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,929
team needs in order to be healthy and to

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,330
deliver their product on any kind of

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:46,940
reliable schedule right all these things

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,460
are new for this team and and if you're

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,520
not managing this carefully it's not

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,990
going to go well you know again we've

00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,130
got that situation where we can't

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,780
estimate this work but there's other

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,700
problems too right how many times you've

00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,110
been on a team and and somebody at a

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,880
stand up says well I couldn't get that

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,190
done because I have a crossbeam

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,559
dependency on this other group and their

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,580
person is out that set this up and no

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,900
one knows how to change the load

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,520
balancer until he gets back

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,620
or she gets back and that this stuff

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,600
happens all the time and I think that

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,860
what's happened is we've just come to

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,140
accept that this is just the way

00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,250
software development is we just accept

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,740
that there's these key person

00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:23,390
dependencies on all of our teams and you

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,880
know that's just the nature of the beast

00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,650
but that's terrible like that's it's a

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,480
bad experience for everybody because

00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,990
here's the thing if you're irreplaceable

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,970
you're unpromoted you can't go and take

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,770
on new things you can't get challenged

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,720
you can't take on some new project

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:41,240
because everybody depends on you to do

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,640
the things you're doing today but we let

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,140
these situations happen the fact of the

00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,880
matter is our teams are under constant

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,220
entropy which means that they're

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,429
constantly like trending toward a bad

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:55,070
state managers and team leaves have a

00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:57,530
responsibility to manage against entropy

00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,809
if you're not managing against entropy

00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,250
then it's gonna go bad that's just the

00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,590
natural direction that's going to go in

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,690
the problem is most of our line managers

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,190
don't think about this this is not on

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,659
their list of things they wake up in the

00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,500
morning and they think you know they're

00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,530
in the shower and they're like my

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,330
gallery of this production issue and

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,620
performance problems and I don't know

00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,210
how to deal with this employee relations

00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,610
problem I've got this HR thing I have to

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,110
go to that's

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,690
they're thinking about they're not

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,730
thinking about is my team healthy are we

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,380
you know sharing skills evenly across

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,309
the team right

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,260
the tragedy here is there's this huge

00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:35,140
opportunity in learning and development

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,240
on our teams people overwhelmingly will

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,040
feel more engaged and happier in their

00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,080
jobs if they feel like they're learning

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,420
new things and gaining and

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,490
responsibility and having opportunities

00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,110
to take on new challenges that's a fact

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,720
right there's a mountain of evidence

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,070
that that points to this I've got some

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,000
other slides I can I can link you to if

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,419
you're interested hit me up on Twitter

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,429
that have I've guide pages of studies on

00:33:55,419 --> 00:33:59,230
this people want to learn they want to

00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:00,940
have challenges even if we're talking

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,440
about something like you know because

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,390
again remind remember there's there's

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,010
sort of two different types of skills at

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,270
play here there's sort of general skills

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,830
like got to the market higher for them

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,379
or I can buy training for them this is

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,419
like JavaScript C sharp angular unit

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:15,850
testing these are general things you can

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:18,310
get but there's domain areas too right

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:20,500
like I have my account signup page and I

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,760
have my order fulfillment system or

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,419
something like that on my email sending

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,020
module

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:28,600
those are domain areas people are more

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,399
motivated typically to learn general

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,190
skills but you learn general skills in

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,980
the context of a domain area so even if

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,210
we're talking about a skill gap on your

00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,159
team where it's like I don't have enough

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,350
people that know the the front end for

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,810
my account signup system well guess what

00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,240
people want to learn angular or react or

00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,340
JavaScript so look across the company

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,050
where you have some JavaScript expertise

00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,730
and let them refine those skills and

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,659
learn the account sign up system now

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,730
you've killed two birds with one stone

00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,379
that person's gonna feel more engaged

00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,910
they're gonna stay at your company

00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,859
longer they're gonna do better work

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,260
because they're learning more skills new

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:06,490
skills and you're de-risking your

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,619
account signup system so I had a big

00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:10,420
problem when I was trying to manage this

00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:12,850
at Ipreo and I started to understand the

00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,609
scope of this problem I couldn't find

00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,080
any tools to help me with this so like

00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:18,700
kind of all cards in the table here I

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,109
went out and I built my own this is a

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,000
free to use thing so I'm not selling you

00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:24,130
anything you can go to Takada IO and

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,240
sign up I encourage you to use it we've

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,550
got a bunch of big companies that are

00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,750
using this now to manage their

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,460
transformations so what you do with

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,020
Toccata is you can go in and to find

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,450
your teams you put your people on the

00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,130
team

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,480
used to kind of list out the skills that

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,130
they need and then just subjectively

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,079
rank them and the tool will help you

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,640
visualize where you have key person

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,930
dependencies where you have skills that

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,220
don't have enough expertise spread

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,589
across them and make good decisions

00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,150
about hiring and training right and then

00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:49,579
you can kind of make a continuous

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,410
improvement process around how are we

00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:53,119
sharing knowledge and expertise of our

00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,339
skills that we need to be successful

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,260
across the whole team so it's helping

00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:58,490
you de-risk over time and again it's

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,280
going to drive better engagement of your

00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,349
employees too I've seen this go badly

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,390
for teams that don't manage this

00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:07,400
proactively this is a big big problem in

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,200
our industry I'm really hoping we start

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,329
to get more aware of it because I think

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,500
it's a bigger inhibitor to productivity

00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:20,619
and improvement than people think so

00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:23,650
kind of wrapping up here click click

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:26,359
click nope

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:27,829
wrapping up here you know there's sort

00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:29,660
of three big areas I want you guys to

00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:31,490
think about as you're dealing with kind

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,050
of large-scale organizational shifts

00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,690
whether it's DevOps are agile everything

00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,060
but definitely for DevOps think about

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,460
your executives use metrics to build

00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,020
bridges teach them what you're doing and

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,970
how you're doing it and why don't ignore

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,490
them bring them along for the ride make

00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,810
them advocates and supporters

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,839
number two is you're kind of dealing

00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:53,300
with change and behavior changes think

00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,460
about values think about reading books

00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,349
like the wolf and CIO is clothing read

00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,270
the hero with a thousand faces you know

00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:01,280
think about psychology think about

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,000
behavior and have conversations about

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,650
that stuff

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,930
forensically figure out what the values

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:07,520
were that got you to today and then what

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,020
are the values need to be to take you

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,300
into where you want to go tomorrow and

00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,339
then finally don't ignore the health of

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,170
your teams please please please

00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,670
whether you use Takada IO or something

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,970
else use a spreadsheet it's fine I don't

00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,420
care

00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,800
but focus on figuring out if your teams

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,780
are healthy what's the current state

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,359
what are the skills they need to be what

00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:28,730
you want them to be and then manage that

00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:30,410
proactively don't wait until you have

00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,819
somebody leave your company to figure

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:35,839
out that you had a key person dependency

00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:40,839
that's too late ok that's it I'm done

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,839
boom 45 minutes on the dot questions

00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:46,450
no questions perfect yeah

00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,510
[Applause]

00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:04,369
because I think it has a huge benefit

00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:05,359
but I know that typically on teams of

00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,970
developers you've got a lot of

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,089
introverts they're gonna be very

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:13,070
resistant to that kind of thing

00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,630
yeah well that's that's that's big so

00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,700
the question was how do you drive things

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,349
like pair programming when you're

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,450
dealing with a bunch of introverted

00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:23,420
people that don't like to interact you

00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:25,070
know that's a tough one I think in

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,510
general if I was gonna unpack that

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,599
question the biggest thing in there is

00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,490
how do you deal with introverts

00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:34,010
so as an extroverted guy I screwed this

00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:35,869
up for a really long time I was like

00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,300
really bad at it

00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:39,710
I thought oh you know what that will

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,980
make this better if I just make this

00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:46,010
person talk in front of his peers like

00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:48,500
what a horrible way to do it right so I

00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,820
think for me the first thing I had to

00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,440
learn was how to empathize with people

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,210
who don't think the way that I do who

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,609
don't who don't aren't energized by the

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,980
same activities I'm energized by that

00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:59,240
was kind of one thing so specifically

00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,430
with pair programming how do you get

00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,560
introverts a pair program you know I I

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:06,530
think you've got to find a way to set

00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,060
good examples so maybe that's you maybe

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:11,480
you get your hands dirty and you write

00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,099
some code and you show them what the

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,790
good outcomes that come from pair

00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:17,990
programming are or use some other team

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,359
as a good example if you have enough

00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,790
know good examples on your own team kind

00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,080
of saying hey listen can we shadow over

00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,280
here and watch how this other team does

00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,650
it we're just going to watch them do a

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,570
pair programming exercise and see what

00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,250
comes out of that code reviews are the

00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,050
same type of deal right I think it's a

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,930
little more obvious with code reviews

00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:37,550
but because pair programming is a little

00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,900
bit more of a trailing indicator when

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,339
you're talking about health all right

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,380
because I need to pair a program a good

00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:46,130
bit in order to feel like I've increased

00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:48,080
my expertise on an area of the code so

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,410
another thing you could do is maybe set

00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,790
some shorter goals like hey listen you

00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,599
know we only have one person on our team

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:58,640
that knows how to do the account signup

00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:00,680
system okay and that's a really big

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,960
problem because when he went on vacation

00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,220
last week he had to get called you know

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,500
why no one likes to get called on

00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,730
vacation so listen for the health of the

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,040
team we need to have somebody else

00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:12,170
that's able to step in and do this type

00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,470
of work while he's gone

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,119
you know John why don't you you you're

00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,710
the best at nodejs and you're the best

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,160
at whatever so why don't you pair and

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,109
the goal then John is next week or two

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,769
weeks from now we want you to be able to

00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:29,539
do a task on your own and not have to

00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:31,819
have anybody help you so like if we do

00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:33,680
that we're gonna get pizza for the team

00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:34,549
or something crazy like that right so

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,980
you're setting some sort of like

00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:38,960
short-term concrete thing that shows

00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,349
like hey this exercise led to a good

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,559
outcome

00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:44,210
so hey pair programming is a way that

00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,099
we're gonna help you get there John I

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:51,499
know there's other things we're gonna do

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:52,190
too as long-winded sorry other questions

00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:59,720
anyone anybody

00:40:52,190 --> 00:41:05,690
thanks for asking that yes good way to

00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:10,999
display metrics yeah yeah yeah so a good

00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,980
way to display metrics you know there's

00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:14,779
there's tons of tools out there that you

00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,480
can pump metrics into I mean you can use

00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:19,579
spunk if you have that available you

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,730
could use power bi we're using that for

00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,410
some metrics now you could use a

00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:27,589
spreadsheet you know the thing I would

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,259
say is one of my goals is to make it as

00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:32,289
easy as possible to track that stuff so

00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:34,730
what I'd rather do rather than like

00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:37,279
manually go out and gather those metrics

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:40,039
once a month is if you can wire your

00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:43,099
systems into some kind of monitoring

00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:46,039
tool whether using spunk or Prometheus

00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:48,470
or power bi like set that up in an

00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,660
automated fashion so that it's very easy

00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,089
to track these things because I've tried

00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,319
to do it manually and I find that you

00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,089
know in the beginning you're doing it

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,119
really regularly right but you have

00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:00,230
other jobs so then the gaps between when

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,549
you're checking these things get longer

00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,799
and longer and longer and then after a

00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:06,170
while you just up checking so if you can

00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:07,880
make it simple and easy by manipulating

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,369
your toolbox to pump those metrics out

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,779
on their own that's the way to go but as

00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:18,369
for what you use I think you got lots of

00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:18,369
options there hopefully that helps yes

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:28,760
and your transformation efforts that you

00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:31,310
would do differently today know the one

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,200
big thing so you know I was talking to

00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:35,450
my friend Magnus about this earlier I

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,130
actually I wrote this I read this book

00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,859
called how Google works and Eric Schmidt

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:43,130
was talking about how he does these

00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,930
radical totally open retrospectives on

00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,330
his performance so I actually wrote one

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,609
of those for fun and of one big thing

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:52,400
that I called out on myself was I wish I

00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:55,490
had done more baselining of metrics in

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,290
the beginning than I did so you saw some

00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,080
of those like you saw the days of delay

00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,850
and the number of manual tickets but I

00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,490
didn't do enough they're like I wish I

00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,890
had mean time to resolution from three

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,560
and a half years ago I wish I had better

00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:12,020
metrics about lead time some of those

00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,880
things are really hard to track but gosh

00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,010
I wish I had them because I think that's

00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,960
the real meat and potatoes of the the

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,359
outcomes that we've driven but it's

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,590
really hard for me to prove that I kind

00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:23,420
of have there's just too many steps

00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,470
right where I say oh we do more releases

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,940
and the change that's are smaller and

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,800
the quality is better and customers are

00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,450
happier but really what I want to be

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,790
able to say is hey that idea that you

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,070
had we can get that into production in

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,560
three months instead of twelve that's

00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,970
the real value but it's very difficult

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,590
to tell that story because I didn't do

00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,790
enough baselining in the beginning so if

00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:43,760
I went back and redid it

00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,710
I would I would make myself get those

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,230
numbers even if it's just a snapshot of

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,510
all that stuff even if it's just

00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:51,740
subjectively asking product owners how

00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,570
long does it take you right now to do

00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,530
this and then just ask them again twelve

00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:00,910
months later I just didn't do it yeah

00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,910
great question yes

00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:14,349
I guess are there any kinds of like

00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:17,680
skills that you can't like I can think

00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:19,180
of skills that aren't easily transferred

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,859
to other people like you got a guy who's

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,510
really good at like who's a data

00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:24,310
scientist and that takes like years of

00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:27,490
learning of like going to school and

00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:28,780
learning the underlying math that you

00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,640
can't really replicate it across a team

00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,200
or you like if it's unrealistic to

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,030
replicate across the team how do you

00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,990
sort of do you ever encounter that did

00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:38,020
you ever encounter that when you were

00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,980
doing stuff and can you different did

00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,540
you learn how to differentiate between

00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,190
like things that should be replicated

00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,940
and things that shouldn't or can't be

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:47,800
replicated yeah that's a great question

00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,020
you know the other one that comes up a

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,150
lot of soft skills so when I built

00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,680
Toccata and we populated it with all

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,750
these hard skills the first thing people

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,490
started asking is can you put soft

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,099
skills on here can you put like

00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,130
presentation skills on here which might

00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:04,660
be another one right so I guess for

00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,220
things like data science and I totally

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,560
agree that that's a really specialized

00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:11,349
like niche almost capability you got to

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,630
understand stats and p-values and stuff

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,400
that I don't know anything about so I

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,869
think you know there are patterns out

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,609
there if you look at the Netflix model

00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:21,130
where they have strong central teams

00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:22,900
that sort of farm themselves out or

00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,330
build capabilities that everybody else

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,710
consumes those might be areas where you

00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,839
just say you know what we can't get away

00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:30,490
from having a central team for this

00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:32,380
because it's too specialized

00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,210
but we're gonna shore it up as best we

00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,339
can and we're gonna make the interaction

00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,650
model for this team we're gonna build a

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:40,420
playbook for them or something like that

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,710
which is what we're doing for our DevOps

00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,390
Consulting Group now where we're gonna

00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,940
have like an enterprise DevOps playbook

00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,920
so when a team comes in and they say we

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,270
want a cloud account we'll say you can't

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,800
have that until you go through this

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,050
playbook and you prove that you have

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,140
enough responsibility and capability to

00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:57,730
use that tool that might be a approach

00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,200
that you could use there for things like

00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,540
presentation skills and soft skills

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,410
that's that's a harder one to me because

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,330
you do have to have like I think I got

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,500
into a LinkedIn argument actually with

00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,540
somebody the other day about this where

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,910
he was like EQ stupid we shouldn't teach

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:16,180
EQ cuz it empowers sociopaths and I was

00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:18,339
like are you insane like that's crazy of

00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,890
course we need to teach EQ like people

00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:23,800
need to work on that stuff you can't

00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:25,780
have a central team to do EQ or soft

00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,320
skills or presentation skills those are

00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:32,560
things that I think are harder to to

00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:37,720
drive but it's so important you still

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:41,830
gotta do it hopefully that helps any

00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:43,270
other questions I'll be sticking around

00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:45,040
