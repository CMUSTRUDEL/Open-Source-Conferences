Wow

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,110
good morning 80 oh wow what a great

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,480
audience so this is my first time in

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:18,030
Raleigh and it's very exciting to be

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,640
here and it's pretty cool 2018 is the

00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,820
20th birthday of open source and the

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,490
open source initiative so this is and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,240
this has just been an amazing year to be

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,950
celebrating but before I start I know

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,870
Todd asked a couple of questions about

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,559
the audience and I saw that a lot of

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,149
folks here well like half the room were

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,300
this was the first time so I put my hand

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,010
up as well but um it's a great room for

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,429
a Mexican wave but we're not going to do

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,170
that so question how many of you have

00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:56,579
been working in open source contributing

00:00:49,170 --> 00:01:00,629
for about a year okay that's a small

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,479
that's a pretty small number I may be

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,840
like 5% how many of you have been

00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:09,380
contributing for five years or up to

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,380
five years

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:21,480
okay that's still like about 10%

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:24,450
how many more than that ten years okay

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,720
that's a fairly small number than I

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,640
thought and so kind of another five

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,290
percent and I know that there's some

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,000
very seasoned open source professionals

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,810
here how many are kind of close to the

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,620
20 years come on get those hands up I

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,480
know you're in there okay Wow and how

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,480
many are completely new to open source

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:51,870
awesome okay that's that's around that

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,480
same kind of five to ten percent okay

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,850
cool so it just gives me an idea given

00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,260
it's my first time at this event and I

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,490
know the lot one last question how many

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,490
of you local sources one

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,479
oh so few skeptics in the room but

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,080
that's about half the room okay that's

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,150
pretty cool

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,050
so you know with open-source we've been

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,690
growing this community and and the code

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,900
base for 20 years and really silently

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,510
disrupting the industry we've seen

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,880
articles you know with headlines like

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,760
these that open-source is eating the

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,569
software world and you know open-source

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,470
has one so it is everywhere today it's

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,239
in all of our devices and it's also in

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,190
all market sectors now there are two

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,260
projects that I work on one is helping

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,640
reduce poverty around the world which is

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,709
based on open-source software the other

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,870
one is saving our planet from an

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,640
asteroid attack that's also working with

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,720
open-source software so it's a whole

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:59,140
spectrum of software and data from the

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,940
Linux Foundation shows that there's

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,030
tremendous growth so for example if you

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:07,989
look at these numbers here and you know

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:11,890
23 million developers 1,100 open-source

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:15,640
projects and the projects on github are

00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:18,070
just you know growing 78 million repos

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,390
on github as well and this is the scale

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,310
at which we're operating as a community

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,310
you see open source is everywhere and

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,350
we've got kind of cool values in our

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,600
community that are sustained us for the

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:36,519
20 years and they've been the key to our

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,730
success and sharing is one of our core

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,519
values and there's a lot of experience

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,250
in the community and talent in our

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,700
communities as well and many of the

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,400
folks you know one year or more in this

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,380
room that put the hands up they they've

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,299
been working on this and some people for

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,829
over two decades just simply sharing so

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,530
you know as well as the projects and

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:05,380
repos the experiences have been shared

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,180
in forms of books blogs articles there's

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,519
a whole host of references for anyone

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,989
here that's new some of those are my

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,030
favorite authors there's a lot more

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,150
books that have come out recently as

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,500
well and you should look at some of

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,940
these references if you're relatively

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,450
new to the community

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,860
the other value is mentoring so you may

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:30,290
recall some of these giants up here on

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,410
the screen and they've been responsible

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,700
for mentoring our communities and

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,180
projects and they're still continuing to

00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,160
but it's also because of the mentors

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,910
that we have this sustainable open

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,290
source that we have today another value

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,580
is collaboration and you know most of

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,430
the people these are most of the people

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,870
that I've worked with on projects or in

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,420
companies on open source and you know

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,970
open source really does take a village I

00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,910
know there's a saying but for us it's

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,800
actually an online global village of

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,800
people that are working together and

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,020
collaborating and coming back to the

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,920
earlier question that I asked you know

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,410
has open source really one well reality

00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,890
is that you know most of the world

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,450
consumes open source software and most

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,180
of the consumers don't actually know

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,700
that they're using open source it is

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,010
everywhere it's just a very well kept

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,100
secret like you know if you ask somebody

00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,419
on the street they wouldn't have a clue

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,290
every organization that's building

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:43,250
services in the Internet in the on the

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,980
cloud you know our customers government

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,960
organizations that are digitizing

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,710
services for citizens they're all

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,000
consumers of open source software and if

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,510
you look at this model from Jeffrey

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,630
Moore

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,640
you know we've have we crossed the chasm

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,100
well the answer is yes in some areas we

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:08,540
have I'm certainly in consumption we

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:10,810
have but have we with contributions well

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,450
we've captured the early adopters and

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,450
the next set of followers and you know

00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:19,400
generally in our technical audience if I

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,620
ask the question how many people are

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,930
contributing it usually is less than 10%

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,610
if it's an open source event it's

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,450
usually much larger than that

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,320
and when I talk to customers and

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,170
government

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,140
usually a lot less so we've got a long

00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,360
way to go as a community and there's a

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,670
lot of willingness to engage and a

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,440
desire to get involved and grow and it's

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,170
a tremendous opportunity for our

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,940
communities to really embrace this kind

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,020
of growth that's coming within

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,180
open-source so in the last six to twelve

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,340
months within aw s what we've noticed is

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,560
an inflection point of customers that

00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,200
are moving to the cloud and every one of

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,740
those customers is a consumer of

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,680
open-source software and you know we see

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,900
these as future contributors to all of

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,430
our projects and all of you that just

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,960
put your hands up saying it was the

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:17,420
first time right so we need the projects

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,520
to get ready and engage with these users

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:24,410
as they know best so we have these books

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,250
that we're giving away at the AWS booth

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:30,400
and in support of this next wave of

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,720
contributors we've produced this book in

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,150
conjunction with O'Reilly Media

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,800
and it's been co-written by aunty Orem

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,350
and myself and it actually will help any

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,930
organization out there and that wants to

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,440
learn more about open source the

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,810
community how to contribute how to run

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,580
your open source project and we'll guide

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,680
you through a process of launching an

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,140
open source project as well this is a

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,330
very thin guide and there's a lot of

00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,650
references and and it refers to

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,540
resources that have been built by this

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,540
community over the years

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,889
so here's a link to the book if you want

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:18,440
to go down and go and download the book

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:22,860
and share it with the communities and

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,630
you know share share widely so for for

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,500
any open-source projects what you need

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,599
to do is really have a you know sir

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,219
allying call to get ready because

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,339
there's a whole host of new people out

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,169
there new consumers that are going to be

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,089
contributing so make sure your

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:42,659
documentation is up to scratch if you

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:45,450
have an open source project be current

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,680
on your housekeeping so display your

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,500
code of conduct

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,080
make sure your mentors are ready and be

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,029
welcoming in the community and kind you

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,480
have a whole new set of developers

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,580
showing up on your projects and you know

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,950
our community is global and it's also

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,070
there's also a bigger focus on diversity

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,790
so this is going to be key to your

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:11,370
success for your projects so come by and

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,980
pick up from the AWS booth who will have

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,829
that and then download the PDF there's a

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,149
link there it's also going to be the

00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:20,160
content will be available it's in

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:25,470
English only now be available for

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,920
translation into other languages and you

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,410
know I'm really excited about this

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,660
engagement with this new community that

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,230
will be or new members and developers

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,670
that will be joining our communities and

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,480
you know open source really is about

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,279
people and you know I was taught values

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,500
very similar to open source values you

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,260
see and this is my dad when he was

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,589
little so he had a passion for education

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,510
and knowledge and of course crickey you

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,510
know he's Indian right so he has to have

00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:01,709
cricket um but as a child he had to walk

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:05,520
six miles to school and six miles back

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:08,730
when he emigrated to the UK in the 60s

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,160
um you know he didn't forget the

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,010
communities that he came from and he

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,980
started a Welfare Society fund for his

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,199
village and he built and also to build a

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,950
high school for the village so he wanted

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:25,420
to improve the lives

00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:27,220
the communities and give back so I

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,440
recall as a kid my dad was always

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,470
fundraising you know five cents here a

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,210
dollar there you know five dollars it

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,920
was back then people didn't have a lot

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,510
of money so five dollars was a lot of

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,640
money and you know you see open-source

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,830
projects actually fundraising for the

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,460
projects too so you know he had a

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:48,010
passion to kind of change lives and and

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,140
because of that he got he got a lot of

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,450
donations and today there's a high

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,520
school there's a junior school and

00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,570
there's a science college in my dad's

00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,910
village in the state of Gujarat so from

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,220
all the efforts that he started and

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,700
fostered 50 years earlier

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,530
you know today 1,500 kids attend the

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,750
school where most of these kids would

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,910
not have got an education there is no

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,730
interest in any of the parents to send

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,280
their kids to school so you know and as

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,220
a steward of his high school project and

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,470
he continued to fundraise he mentored

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,930
others to carry on the work he bought

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,630
employment to the region and he built a

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:31,180
community to really help sustain the

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,520
school and his vision was the current

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,340
and future generations would continue to

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,390
benefit from this lifetimes work so he's

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,030
also a geek

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,570
and at heart and there was nothing that

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:46,180
was impossible to do so at the age of 70

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,910
he built a website so that new

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,820
generations of students could see you

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,450
know the legacy and at 87 he still

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,300
maintained content online for the site

00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,700
and he posted exam results every year so

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,000
that the donors and the contributors to

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,560
those to the high school could see the

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,480
kind of the results of their

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:12,520
contributions as well and you see yeah

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm kind of stand here with a very heavy

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:19,890
heart because my dad passed away

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:24,190
recently and he left this amazing legacy

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,400
so through his life's work you know he

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:30,400
taught me these values of sharing

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:33,240
mentoring collaborating and contributing

00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,240
and giving back

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,360
these these are our open source values

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,270
and the values that our community holds

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,910
dear my dad started his project 50 years

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:49,080
ago we've got like 20 years within our

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,180
community already right so a legacy that

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,540
you know we need to continue to build on

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,790
as well to grow and make sustainable and

00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,220
let's support these community members

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,860

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,530
focus on what makes this community and

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,590
