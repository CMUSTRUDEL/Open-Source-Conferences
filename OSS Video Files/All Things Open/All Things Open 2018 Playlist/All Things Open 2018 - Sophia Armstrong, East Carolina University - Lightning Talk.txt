but my name is Sofia Armstrong I am a

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,230
current computer science major at East

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,660
Carolina University I'm really excited

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,660
to be graduating in May so I'm looking

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,460
for jobs if your company is hiring

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,490
please come talk to me after like please

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,269
come to me so back to business today I

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,970
will be discussing a blockchain database

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,310
for a cyber security learning system and

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,610
the trendy technology I got to play

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,410
around with when implementing it so

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,590
first a little background on this

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,670
project and the cybersecurity learning

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,969
system so each student will have ten

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,140
virtual machines for their defender

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,809
environments and then an additional

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,879
environment for their attacker which as

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,579
you can guess will be used to attack the

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,340
other students defenders environments

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,280
and the objective of this system is to

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,100
provide a game based learning experience

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,010
so we really want to make sure we keep

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,040
an accurate score of the interactions

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,890
between the students attackers and

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,439
defenders so my team and I are using

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,720
bash and Python scripts to monitor these

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,479
interactions between the students

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,850
virtual machines and this information is

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,939
going to be sent through a firewall and

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,090
syslog syslog format so we have this

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,490
additional security just up front a

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,290
firewall and then our blockchain

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:42,299
database is going to sit behind that as

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:45,000
an additional security precaution so our

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,250
quest for the best and most secure

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,040
technology has led us to discover big

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,640
chain DB so a little bit about big chain

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,799
DB base chain DB is an open-source

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,610
blockchain software with the following

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,350
characteristics it is decentralized

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,719
there's no single point of control which

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,780
means there's also no single point of

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,849
failure it is Byzantine fault tolerant

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,190
so up to one third of the nodes can be

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,780
experiencing arbitrary faults and the

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,380
rest of the network will still

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,560
provide consensus and operate smoothly

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,620
it is immutable which is more than just

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,900
hamper resistant the data once it is put

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,540
on the blockchain it cannot be changed

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,980
or deleted it can only be updated with

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,010
later chains in the blockchain it has a

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,160
high transaction rate and a low latency

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,500
which solves the problems that typically

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,570
arise when having large amounts of data

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:49,080
on a blockchain

00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:51,570
it is also providing customizable assets

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,000
and an asset is just the data that's

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,280
stored in your blockchain you get to

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,870
decide like what characteristics go into

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,690
that what are the at what are the

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,510
attributes and what not and then on top

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,750
of all of that we still have indexing

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,840
and querying capability for the data in

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,080
the backend database thanks to dB

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,110
so as you can see big Chain DB really

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,910
takes like the best of both worlds of a

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,280
typical blockchain and then a

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,850
distributed database and it just merges

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:29,160
it all together for like a super secure

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:31,860
system a little more on big chain DB

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,269
terminology and how it all works

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,160
together so big chain DB node is a logic

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,299
machine running the necessary software

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,829
such as the big chain DB server software

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,980
 DB which is the back-end database

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,810
and then tinder mint which is the

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,350
software that provides the blockchain

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,730
functionality a big chain DB node is

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:59,549
access and created using a big chain

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,860
HTTP API or a wrapper for that API such

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,010
as a big chain DB driver it comes in

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,810
multiple languages such as Python which

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,810
is always exciting and Java Script and a

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,810
big chain DB cluster is at least four

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:20,489
big chain DB nodes working together and

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:24,750
a big chain DB network is a cluster of

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:28,110
big chain DB nodes performing consensus

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,490
so here's a nice graphic of everything I

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,730
discussed kind of all working together

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,770
you have your your node your MongoDB in

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,140
the backend your server software and

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,250
your tinder meant providing consensus

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,910
algorithms and that's pretty much what

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:48,000
our system looks like we had four

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:51,210
computers distributed so yeah I hope

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,120
that excited you and you can check out

00:04:51,210 --> 00:05:00,199
big chain DB thank you

00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,199
