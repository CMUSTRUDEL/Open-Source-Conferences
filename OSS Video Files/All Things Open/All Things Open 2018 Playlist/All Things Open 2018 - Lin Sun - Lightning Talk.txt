good afternoon everybody

00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,759
it's nice to do this in my home time in

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,570
leaving Raleigh North Carolina for

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,520
almost 20 years now so it's t oh let's

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,369
just do a quick show hand now how many

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,820
of you are already using micro service

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,760
or on the journey to convert your

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,420
monolithic application to be micro

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,750
service based application wow that's a

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,910
lot of you so it's about 50 or maybe 40

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,300
percent of you so even though a lower

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,489
number have used Sto but you guys are

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,489
definitely looking at micro services

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,070
this is a picture we took in San

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,280
Francisco for a favorite Island our

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,989
actress Island and we saw the ISTE of

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,260
both there so we were like we have to

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,930
take that picture so what is the ISTE oh

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,909
it still is an open service matched

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,640
platform to connect observe secure and

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,159
control your micro services and what's

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,650
really neat about sto it's an open

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,799
platform first of all it was a project

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,560
funded by IBM Google and lyft in May

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,790
last year and the community has grown

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,369
into 200 plus contributors and it's

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,520
really surviving community Red Hat is a

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,220
big contributor of it Cisco VMware and

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,549
all the other big companies and even a

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,520
cup of startups to the service mesh

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,979
framework is meant to be transparent to

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,500
your micro services that you don't

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,750
really have to make much code change to

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,659
work with your micro services it's

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,829
supposed to be language independent so

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,630
you don't have to do the things

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:56,969
differently for different languages so

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,159
how many of you are writing in more than

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,710
one language is all your team are

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,680
writing in more than one languages okay

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,619
so that's a lot of you so your team is

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,810
probably having many languages and some

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,910
of the common problems too how do you

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,480
connect and observe and secure and

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,360
control

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,989
micro-services I bet you don't want to

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,349
solve them in language-dependent way in

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:25,200
your application so it still is there to

00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:29,310
help you it's a network for services not

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,069
for bytes to abstract that code that you

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,860
need to have in your application but

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,860
have the platform provider code for you

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,349
one thing I want to share is it still is

00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,739
highly configurable so you can run Sto

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,709
even without the Envoy sidecar so many

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,799
of you heard of it is do envoy sidecar

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,110
has been a key component that runs along

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,540
with your micro services but we think

00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,880
it's do if you have a leaf service

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,730
that's not talking to you any of the

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,940
other services you actually don't need

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,650
your envoy sidecar with your services

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,650
and you still get a bunch of

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,349
functionality provided by sto such as

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,690
traffic management traffic steering

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:19,799
traffic shifting and 40 injection I know

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,400
that you can also run sto with your

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,769
existing ingress our resource so ingress

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,500
resource controller so if you prefer

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:29,910
engine X you can always start with that

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000
there's no problem with that

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,700
you can run on voice icon on your

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,799
services you get our benefit of the mesh

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,859
one thing I have to highlight are we do

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,709
save it's very very very minimum code

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,930
changes to your services in order for

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,769
you to get distributed tracing to work

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,680
properly to tie every single our trace

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:58,410
together into a single request for

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,290
multiple your services you do have to

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,260
propagate your headers or distribute

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,870
tracing and English into that it still

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,660
supports dark launch in canary testing

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,859
and for dark launching we do require you

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,229
your application that's - your services

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,959
kind of a prop propagate the headers for

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:24,840
you in this example where propagates the

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,620
the user the user header so these are

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,160
the part

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,949
to help us grow the sto community and

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,220
there's a lot of customers already using

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:39,750
its do in production environment some of

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,610
the big names I obey and IBM is also

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,410
using the weather company been using

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,900
Trulia you probably you guys probably

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,600
heard of it's a real estate company so a

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,650
lot of company are using SEO in their

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,470
micro service journey so I would highly

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,600
encourage you to try it Co today and

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,139
there are some resources you can reach

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,100
out to us on the mailing list for any

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,460
questions you have

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,920
thank you

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,920
