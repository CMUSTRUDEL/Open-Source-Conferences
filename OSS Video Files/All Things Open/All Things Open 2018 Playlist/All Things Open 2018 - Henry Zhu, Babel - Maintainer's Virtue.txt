	00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:08,370
all right so I'm Henry I'm gonna be

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:14,969
talking a bit about they say what it's

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:19,679
like to be a maintainer yeah it looks

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:22,800
like the clicker isn't working okay you

00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,929
can find me on Twitter as left pad and

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,390
we're yeah talk about kind of nature of

00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:35,550
open source through my experience so the

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,910
question I want to be asking to myself

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,890
is is code enough when we think about

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,350
open source a lot of times we think it's

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,500
just the code because open source is

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:50,040
about source code but what about or is

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,780
it isn't more than that yeah so I would

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,870
consider this talk kind of like an intro

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,120
to talk that effing game called the hard

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,060
parts of open source which I would

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,420
recommend you watch it's a lot longer 45

00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,330
minutes so yeah let's we can start with

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,470
the phrase itself so open source I found

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,140
out is now 20 years old and like the

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,390
term itself was coined that a lot that

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,310
long ago and I think the last years has

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,560
brought in a lot more people into open

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,810
source both those users and maintainer

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,880
x' just has to be so in the last talk

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,960
like lots of companies are using open

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,430
source and in many different ways and

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,800
one of the biggest changes is github and

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,560
github also turned 10 years old this

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,540
year and so you know we've introduced a

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,030
lot of vocabulary like pull requests and

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,440
hackathons even this month Oktoberfest

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,979
and all these things have been

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:49,950
contributing to spreading open source

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:52,040
but then I'm asking myself what what

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,180
does it mean to be a healthy community

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,549
just cuz we're growing in numbers does

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,820
that mean we're actually doing well are

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,770
the metrics that we're trying to like

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,180
track are they actually reflecting the

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,270
state of what we're doing or is it

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,729
something else and so my question is how

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,790
are the people doing not just the code

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,410
what about maintainer xand would be

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,290
maintained or people that want to get

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,000
Walt you know in this age of github so

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,070
many people are getting involved but you

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,540
know they might not understand the

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,400
history they might just be all

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,190
volunteers are not paid they're

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,280
depending on by hundreds of companies

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,990
and they're all volunteers I think that

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,790
is kind of the way it is with the

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,630
project I work on which is called Babel

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,600
a lot of people don't know this but it's

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,850
not a company I'm no loony they're all

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,560
volunteers and so I think it's

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,150
surprising to a lot of people that this

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,470
thing that have so many people relying

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:52,110
on is just like a few a few people and

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,350
it's only since March I left my job

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,570
Adobe and I decided to work on Dahl

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,270
full-time took me about like a year to

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,570
just decide to take that leap of faith

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,580
and kind of decide okay do I want to do

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,620
this thing through like crowdfunding and

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,480
so I launched like a patreon we have an

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,960
open collective and so right now and

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,210
funded by the community and even then

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,300
you know will money solve all our issues

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,290
I think there's a lot of discussion

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,890
about sustainability and I think this is

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,780
interesting

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:32,340
this is why I feel about it right now I

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:34,080
guess we're yeah so this was at the last

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,120
conference I was at someone thought it'd

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,770
be funny to have like a little donation

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,450
box for me I guess it's unhappy Indian

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,770
outside got a few hundred dollars from

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:49,350
it but I don't know if I should be happy

00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:52,170
or sad from that so you know the

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,489
question is like am I like living the

00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,230
dream now like the dream for a lot of

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,350
people is to do open source full-time

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,630
but you know I'm up here it's like is it

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,220
just survivorship bias am I just just

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,130
one person right how is this gonna work

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,550
out for a lot of people and why do I

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,470
feel so much anxiety and what I'm doing

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,209
like you'd think that when you're doing

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,400
it full-time everything's like happy and

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:21,510
you can you're free to do whatever you

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,010
want but really yeah you know it's the

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,889
constant feeling like the word I would

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,650
use to describe maintainer is

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,539
now in anxiety and I like to think about

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:36,439
like what are the reasons why that's

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:37,430
happening yeah so I think one of the

00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,199
things I've been thinking about is how

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,779
our culture is shaped by the culture

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,240
around us and that includes type culture

00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,039
and the culture at large and so the

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,289
thing that drawn me to open-source in

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,939
the first place was helping people you

00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,219
know volunteer work and serving others

00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,860
well I find myself moving in other

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:57,349
directions not against my will but

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,120
because of linking find the environment

00:04:57,349 --> 00:05:01,939
around me and so it's not like someone

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,129
told me I should act this way or that I

00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:06,710
even believe it but I kind of find

00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:08,539
myself moving in different directions

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,870
I think the phrase I would use to

00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:14,330
describe this is that we're the things

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,009
that we do are caught not taught it's

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,620
kind of like how kids pick up on what

00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:20,900
their parents do not what they say we're

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,189
creatures of habit and so a lot of times

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,949
we learn from our experience more than

00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:26,749
just what people say and I mean example

00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,879
this is like coming here and giving this

00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:30,979
talk I could feel guilty that I'm not

00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,960
like giving back to open source or

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,439
making the commits because I'm not like

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,360
working on a project and it's not that

00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,370
doing this is part of open source but

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,860
but then it's like instilled in me that

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,899
being a maintainer means like you know

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,199
making commits this project when it's a

00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:50,000
lot more than that and so yeah this

00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,039
assumption is that code is all that

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,819
matters like I don't believe that but

00:05:52,039 --> 00:06:00,169
then but my actions and what I do might

00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:02,000
reflect that in my body and I rather

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:07,610
than like even though I'm saying I don't

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,620
believe that another another thing that

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,229
is interesting is this idea of

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,270
gamification so even though github

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,379
removes streaks you know it's coming up

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,629
in all these different ways you know

00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,849
like hey you know you didn't get to this

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:24,770
external motivation thing not you can

00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:28,430
like pay for it to get it back and or

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:32,599
this idea that you know we have to work

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,759
like so much so that that's my github

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,910
contribution graph for the last few

00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,520
years

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,280
not really proud of that you know

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,750
there's a culture of overwork in our

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,450
society and especially in Thai culture

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,370
and it kind of is like bleeding into

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,690
open sores you know I was working all

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,570
day and then I went the open source at

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,990
night and then I have a job and I still

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,670
do it

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,240
and then now that I'm doing it full-time

00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,190
you know I might feel like in my in my

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,260
allowed to not work on the weekend I

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,030
always have to be on call you feel like

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,560
you never can take a vacation and then

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,790
if people are giving you money if you'll

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,120
even worse because you're like oh I

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:12,600
should be like working more and so this

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,030
like desire to like be welcoming be open

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,490
to helping so many people causes you to

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,670
like not really think about your own

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,450
well-being and having boundaries and so

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:27,510
this idea is you know and there's other

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,550
things like what is success mean I think

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,920
in open source it's like how many stars

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,810
you have how many downs do you have you

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,660
know how many dependencies do you have

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,970
and all those things are cool but then

00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,460
do they even help what it like

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,530
maintaining the project like just having

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,360
more people it feels like a curse in a

00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,550
way because you don't get more people

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,500
giving you donations and don't get

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,770
people helping out so it's just more

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,480
burden and I find myself wanting to like

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,820
increase those numbers even though I

00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,710
know that those don't matter at all this

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,810
idea of like wanting to do things for

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,240
yourself and having an internal

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,190
motivation to help people is great but

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,090
then there's all these other things are

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,820
pushing me in a different way and you

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,770
know how much are our tools helping so

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,150
this is like our slack room this is like

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,310
a normal conversation right someone

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,900
joins our slack and then just post like

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,850
an error message and they're kind of

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,300
expecting you to like know what to do

00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,800
right it's not that different from all

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,440
the rest of our life like we have like

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,210
instant you know viewing with Netflix

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,610
and instant buying on Amazon all these

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,229
things to do things immediately and then

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,610
you expect the people that are

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:38,130
maintaining a project to do the same

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,260
thing and so there's no aspect of like a

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,880
human relationship you kind of get

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,440
treated as like a robot where you kind

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,290
of have to instantly respond and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,120
everything is very transactional you

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,380
know you don't need to understand anyone

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,870
you

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,400
need to like spend time it's just like

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,990
something where people grow in

00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,590
impatience and worse than that is people

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,810
end up with you know entitlement I'm

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,460
sure this is pretty common especially in

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,820
open source where it's like hey they

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,080
just demand things from you right and

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,140
you think that if something is free

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,080
people will be grateful for it but it

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,940
doesn't turn out that way and it's

00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,070
really easy to want to respond in the

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,540
same way right I think the problem is

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,920
like you and you could you're coming

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,110
into this morning to help people and

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,990
they respond in that way and you're just

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,150
like I'm not like them I'm like and you

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,280
had this like it makes you feel a little

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,430
self-righteous too and my desire to help

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,740
people is like causing me to feel

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,140
entitlement as well

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,120
and so I guess one way to put this is

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,630
that the things that we're doing like

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,670
the habits that we have they they're

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,830
actually changing us in a way too so

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,490
we're not the idea that we're not always

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,490
in control

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,470
yeah and so you know they ask

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,850
I'm just asking myself like what are the

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,430
behaviors were encouraging and

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,080
incentivizing and which ones are forming

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,200
us in the ways that we want which is the

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,580
ways that we don't desire what's

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,070
actually causing me to believe that

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,750
overworking is okay that success is

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,360
about numbers this I think this is an

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,120
interesting way to think about it you

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,090
know this this idea that you know you

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,770
were coming again with the concern to do

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,570
good for truth and all these things but

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,590
then you end up being the thing you

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,500
didn't want to turn into in the first

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,660
place so when I ask people to be

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:38,660
respectful but then what happens when I

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:42,110
get I get mad I get irritated right am I

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:46,060
am I just like not able to change am I

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,060
just being affected by the environment

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,560
and yeah so like what do we actually do

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:59,410
about that I think this cause you might

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,410
have heard this before but see

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,200
it's more of a joke but you know I think

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,220
because we're we were in an open source

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,380
and we're working as a team

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,920
I might define virtue a little

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,630
differently as more of a habit it's a

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,670
habit that brings us closer to what we

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,670
think this community should be about

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,770
yeah

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,750
and so our visions and and what we want

00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,610
this community be isn't like it's not

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,290
gonna be understood by words alone right

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,880
it's gonna be like a way that we're

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,580
supposed to be feeling and experiencing

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,090
to be moved by a certain way of living

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,240
right and so the person that did that

00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,820
quote Larry wall he did he actually

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,940
wrote another quote later which maybe is

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,720
better in our community where it's the

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,790
opposite actually

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,800
so and it's saying that like how are we

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,120
going to be how are we going to be in

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,190
relationship to one another as

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,870
maintainer x' like why do we even use

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,370
the word maintainer we might use the

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,230
word steward or neighbor right and so

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,870
really I'd like to think that open

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,440
source like a lot of life is a mirror

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,400
right it's a way of like showing you

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,400
what you're like what's your character

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,550
yeah not just what I believe like in my

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,210
thoughts but like I like what I believe

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,220
in my heart through these habits I mean

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:34,840
it shows me like yeah what my character

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,520
is so what exactly am i reflecting to

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,470
everyone else when I am doing open

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,240
source not just like output of the code

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:47,950
but like the way I'm doing it but even

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,920
you know that vision can be you know

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,390
changed in a different way where it's

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,730
sometimes you know I have an idea of

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,410
community but that idea gives me a lot

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,510
of pride into it like how it should

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,329
happen if I don't feel that it comes out

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,610
that way

00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:07,529
and I'm kind of imposing what what I

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,319
think over others and yeah

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,749
so like are those visions selfish like

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:14,369
if I set my own demands and it fails

00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:17,970
then I'll say it's it's someone else's

00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:20,399
fault and I think like this pursuit of

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,720
what what we want isn't might actually

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,499
be a detriment where we're not actually

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:29,970
doing it right like loving the dream

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:31,949
more than the people itself and so yeah

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,449
the question is what is our call as

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:36,809
maintain errs and people when open

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:43,769
source what what should we do I think

00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:46,499
why you summarized it is yeah I would

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:49,470
call it you know a long and B D ins in

00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:52,649
the same direction right doing the

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:56,279
virtue in for a long time for the long

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,929
run right to show people that like when

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:00,329
when they don't deserve it you still

00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,920
show them love when when you're growing

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:04,319
impatient that you don't lash out at

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,049
people that you can serve people without

00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,579
demanding some kind of recognition and

00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:13,379
the idea like where where's our hope

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:15,239
coming from yeah and so if you're

00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,339
interested in what I think that looks

00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:19,230
like through the lens of faith I

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,439
actually just made a podcast with my

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,939
friend Nadia last Tuesday and so we

00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:27,449
released it kinda like Netflix style so

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:29,459
you can like binge listen to it and yeah

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,059
I just talked a lot about so what 30

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,649
minutes for each episode about how I see

00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:38,059
me like faith and related to like

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,529
community evangelism raising money

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:43,730
bringing in new people welcoming people

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:47,399
things like that Thanks

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,399
