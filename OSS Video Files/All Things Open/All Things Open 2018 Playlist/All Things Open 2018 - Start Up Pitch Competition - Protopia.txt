00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:13,349
welcome Rolly so my my name is Mack

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,809
slicin I'm the CEO of proto Pia we're

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,210
Raleigh based technology companies that

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,180
open sources expertise within innovation

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,660
organizations so I've been Azaria for a

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,369
while

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,410
I've had a product manager experience

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,570
for about 20 years CAD venture-backed

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,789
software companies local individuals

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,450
with no channel visor syquest at

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,969
netsertive and UNC Chapel Hill MBA

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,920
walked away about two years ago and to

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,260
really follow my mission and my passion

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,020
to figure out what it would take for

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,329
people to connect interviewed a lot of

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,070
individuals and really understood what's

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,890
the dynamic for somebody to ask for help

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,160
and somebody give help and how do you

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,110
make that easy and so we we iterated

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,230
quite a lot learned a lot went through

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,989
the NC idea accelerator and came out and

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,800
focused our software to entrepreneur

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,019
organizations

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,150
knowing as an entrepreneur I know that

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,439
challenge well how to ask for help how

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,630
to tap the network and so we developed

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,790
technology that automates and the

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,710
matchmaking that often happens between

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,110
entrepreneurs and the advisors the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,060
investors the service providers in those

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,530
networks and and make it easy for

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,180
individuals to ask for help

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,159
and make it very easy for individuals as

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,320
you probably know to give help it needs

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,420
to be relevant easy and respectful

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,180
because everybody wants your time

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,680
so we automate this but really let me

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,380
tell you what we do through the story of

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,079
a customer MassChallenge is one of the

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,130
world's largest accelerators 1,500

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,439
startups 8,000 advisors and our tour is

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,869
a mental manager at Mass Challenge in

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,700
Boston what our tour really doesn't want

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,409
to do is match entrepreneurs to advisors

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,570
what he rather do is sit down with

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,729
entrepreneurs one-on-one it gives them

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,710
advice and coach them so it eats up a

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,680
lot of his cycles the other problem that

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,960
r2 has is that he wants to know who the

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,149
best mentors are because when you reach

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,320
out as a pro to mentor you wouldn't make

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,390
sure that the individual gives good

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,910
advice that they respond and they they

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,620
help you make meaningful progress so we

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,379
started working with our tour

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,580
now the way most solution providers

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,230
solved this problem today and

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,540
MassChallenge has--is as well

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,000
they create a directory somewhere that

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,519
you can go where everybody in network is

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,860
classified with expertise their location

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,980
and you type something in and you try

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,680
the best people that can help you right

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,440
there but it's not easy to go in there

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,269
and find someone it really is not easy

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,549
for the advisors because they don't want

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,260
to get hammered with inbound increase

00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,599
they're very selective on who they want

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,849
to help and then how do u s-- create the

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,430
right rapport between the entrepreneur

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,980
and the advisor and that's actually how

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,950
most companies go to market today they

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,840
build very sexy interfaces directories

00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,819
you go in you create a better search

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
experience LinkedIn is one of those and

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,680
then you rely on the entrepreneur to go

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,349
and find and engage those individuals so

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,549
we've intentionally done something

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:13,590
different a deceptively low-tech

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,810
application that first of all does not

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,510
require you to login it does not require

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,430
you to download an application but

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,130
allows the entrepreneur the innovator to

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,989
ask a question that we take apart to

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,310
understand who you are what you're

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,010
asking for

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,510
and then we go into the network we mind

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,760
the network and find the very best

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,459
advisors that can help based on

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,459
expertise location preferences past

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,260
behavior we stack rank them and then go

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,599
to the first five to ten of them and

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,400
bacey saying this matches your

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,379
wheelhouse you seem to be available

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,500
you've told us that you'd like to hear

00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,359
from us do you have a minute to help not

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,549
only do we ask them if you want to help

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,620
but we also asked you how you want to

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,629
help you want to share advice you want

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,030
to share a call you wanna share meeting

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,579
and by the way nobody knows we've asked

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,650
you so you have a guilt-free know which

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,379
is really important when you're busy

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,299
professional and when you pass we go

00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,150
decks to the next batch of invest

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,310
advisors in the queue and we ask if they

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,250
can help and we don't rest until the

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,750
entrepreneur has been helped and at the

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,120
end of it we go back and we get

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,039
qualitative and quantitative advice and

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,780
insights from the from the adviser and

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:26,820
the entrepreneur to figure out how well

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,590
it worked we encouraged on

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,440
preneur to reach out to the advisor to

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,200
build that human connection that's so

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,560
important for the entrepreneur and so

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,570
going back to Arthur he no longer has to

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,370
do any matching it runs automatically

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,350
for him actually one of the biggest

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,260
values we drive for our customers is

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,910
that saving them time so they don't have

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,920
to invest the half a resource that we

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,840
see on average on making that match

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,300
making the technology does afford them

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,520
what's more important is he actually now

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,770
has insight and how his community is

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,930
engaging he knows who the best mentors

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,880
are the best entrepreneurs he knows

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,430
who's not pulling his or her weight and

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,270
also where the programming gaps are that

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,420
he needs to do so of course as a

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,190
start-up we love free software but one

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,800
of the reasons of course we love open

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,720
source is that open source is very much

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,030
leveraging expertise that has out a

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,580
network and individuals giving their

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,470
time and expertise to develop new things

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,350
so we are essentially in open source

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,590
technology to help tap the expertise and

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,150
make it easier on all sides other

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,390
organizations we're working with our

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,640
co-working spaces accelerators higher

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,710
education university high education

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,200
entrepreneurship programs so we work

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,590
with NC State's love them and HQ Raleigh

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,640
just launched over the last two weeks

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,500
how we're making money the business

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,840
model so we charge a subscription fee

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,730
monthly or annual it depends on how big

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,950
the network is it depends on what

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,050
capabilities you want it also depends on

00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,840
if you wanted desire an integration so

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,390
some of our customers have CRM systems

00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,340
they have ERP systems they don't nest

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,170
one they reinvent the wheel and create a

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,040
new application but they want to see

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,930
more engagement in their communities our

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,330
first market is to entrepreneurship

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,330
organizations or there's about 20,000 in

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,070
North America but we've also started

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,050
conversations already with higher

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,790
education we just launched NC State

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,500
mechanical engineering to connect

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,530
students to alumni and make that easy

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,660
and respectful and the big prize for us

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,460
is actually enterprises when you've got

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,520
a global organization such as red head

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,169
and Citrix or Cisco how do you find the

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,180
individual that can help you with

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,590
expertise right now that is available

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,630
for example for sale

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,360
call for some code that you need to

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,890
deploy or integration you to make so

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,590
making that happen and making that smart

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,810
making it easy is what we're about of

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,330
course it's not just me I'm incredibly

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,030
fortunate to be joined by a team that is

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,230
passionate on a technology site

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,960
marketing sales business development

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,540
operations we've got a team of advisers

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,550
that have run entrepreneurship programs

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,320
that have been mentors that help in

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,750
entrepreneurs that guide us in our

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,030
strategy and how we go forward and stay

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,660
as you probably know most importantly

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,760
focused on our core target market so I'm

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,550
gonna stop actually wouldn't ask myself

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,260
we are startup we're looking for talent

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,690
people that are really passionate about

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,970
using artificial intelligence to drive

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,710
human intelligence number two we're

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,960
looking for funding we've just started a

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,430
process for a first round and we're

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,190
looking for innovative organizations

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,960
that are trying to scale and make it

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,950
easier for people to connect regardless

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:47,970
of timezone and borders but that I'm

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:50,130
done any questions all right great

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,880
presentation from Berto B&L is hear from

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,490
our judges

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,490
and yes the accent is German

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,300
so I'm trying to understand the problem

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,520
exactly okay if you could synthesize it

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,710
down to ten seconds what is the

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,200
compelling reason why someone would want

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,490
to use proto pia so from a buying

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,260
authorization perspective they're

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,050
actually spending time today

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,540
matching entrepreneurs to their experts

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:30,210
so most of organizations spend about

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,120
half a resource 2/4 resource taking

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,060
these questions and matching them so you

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
if you belong to an accelerator

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,670
somebody's trying to get to you and

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,300
there's typically a gatekeeper so that's

00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,790
number one

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,770
saving his organization's time the other

00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,170
is also that people often lack the

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,630
insight who the best mentors are and the

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,000
best experts in a network so we write

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,280
them that insight so it's time saving

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,150
and giving them insights into how

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,550
effective that community is working but

00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,510
that answer question I think it kind of

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,000
answered the question but I'm trying to

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:07,320
so so it's basically incubators or

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,470
filters into entrepreneurs or very busy

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,230
yep professionals would use your service

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:17,670
to offload some of the cycling between

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,990
incoming requests their calendar their

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:26,190
time I'm just trying to understand like

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:28,230
where that sort of slots in to a market

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,570
you know I mean yep because there's a

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,060
finite number of incubators board states

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,140
yeah absolutely and so the entrepreneur

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,970
organization is well you know they first

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,190
market we're going after if you look

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,710
even at Association stage drive on

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,880
engagement so I'm an association member

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,830
let's say a certified financial

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,210
professionals and are looking for

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,640
somebody who's got experienced with a

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,170
new tax laws that passed the number one

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,120
problem that individual was solved as a

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,650
school directory go through the

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,660
directory and reach out and saying

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,210
listen what are the implications of that

00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,250
tax law in West Virginia so we use

00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,320
technology to find that right individual

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,540
and then make it very easy and respect

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,680
for that person to engage right so let's

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,700
really take the friction out of the

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,760
process so building two-sided markets is

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,240
always tricky it is yes so I'm an expert

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,850
why do I care I mean do I get paid do i

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,610
or do you get paid when I join

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,140
how do I you know you find me randomly

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,730
and then I get a note from you saying

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,140
hey there's somebody who needs you how

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,640
does all know that's a great question

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,680
let me let me be clear about this so

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,450
MassChallenge as a customer they

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,700
actually plug their network into our

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,160
solution we don't have a network you're

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,710
already signed up as a mentor to help

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,780
MassChallenge startups so you go through

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,610
a sign-up process and they saying hey we

00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,050
want you to help out somebody's trying

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,450
to open it or somebody's looking for

00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,410
pitching advice they may reach out to

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,450
you and saying are you available for

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,030
lunch hours or available to come in and

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,380
mentor someone many many advisers

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,540
actually saying listen I don't have time

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,970
for lunch I'd love to help but I'm a

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,320
really busy individual so we're trying

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,780
to make it easier for them

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,820
so rather than two sided marketplace

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,780
they plug their networks into what we do

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,480
okay so you're offering me an intra

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,040
organizational connectivity solution

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,420
that's for a better way okay

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,400
that's correct thank you I had mark same

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,290
question in terms of what's in it for

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,580
the expert yeah I think you answered

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,020
that so with the machine learning though

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,780
and artificial intelligence if they're

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,120
putting their profiles and it seems like

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,340
it'd just be easy to search by keywords

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,610
that they have in there so what's the AI

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,200
or ml yeah no so absolutely we do offer

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,300
the ability for someone to launch a

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,710
directory right but many advisors and

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,510
mentors actually choose to have their

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,000
profiles hidden saying listen I don't

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,230
want an entrepreneur reach out to me but

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,580
if there's something that I can help

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,250
with I want you to let me know about

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,140
this right but I'm really busy I don't

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,940
want to say no I don't want to be a bad

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,700
person so we're trying to make it very

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,830
easy for you and saying listen Karen

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,020
you're only gonna get an email when this

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,760
really matches not only what you're

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,190
interested in but how you've behaved in

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,320
the past and where you're located and

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,630
then you can either respond and engage

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,980
or you can simply pass and we'll just

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,390
get you the next time when we find

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,640
something that you want to assist with

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,650
because you've signed up to be a part of

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,480
this network and you've indicated that

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,090
you want to help but we also know your

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,090
time is really busy does it help

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,910
you say the assault we're a service how

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,649
do you price them so we price based on

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,660
the size of networks so let's say you've

00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:36,879
got five thousand individuals in that

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,300
network that weed that you want us to

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,540
engage we base a subscription and yearly

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,500
or monthly based on the size of network

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,060
and how do you come up with that number

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,300
the number of the network know the

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,220
number that you price so it we're very

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,170
early right now we've anchored a little

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,910
bit what the customers tell us and what

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,860
other solutions charge in a market and

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,709
as you probably can imagine we test

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,180
these price points so right now the

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,160
average price point is about seven

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,259
thousand dollars a year I like to double

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
that but it's just a matter of learning

00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:14,740
more and building capabilities on top of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,380
this please join me a big hand for proto

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,680
Pia

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,820
[Applause]

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,820
