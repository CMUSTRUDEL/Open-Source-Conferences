all right hello everybody

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:11,509
um there we go what we're gonna do is

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,519
take a look at a talk here that I did

00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:16,800
previously this year how to jumpstart

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,359
your career and open source and the one

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,730
thing I'm not going to talk about is

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,420
pull requests I'm not going to talk

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,519
about going and coding someplace it

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,650
really doesn't matter what your focus is

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,670
on something like this it's just that

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,940
you want to do something to give back

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,630
all right who here has a career in open

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,780
source right now so we're an open source

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,989
conference and about maybe one third are

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,020
saying they have a career in open source

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:48,379
how many people are using open source

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,350
that's everybody big difference

00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:54,510
it's all about you what you are doing

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,070
with it by using open source might be

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,370
because your employer says I have to use

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,379
open source but a lot of times you're

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,760
finding a reason to track in a certain

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,840
direction because something interests

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,900
you all right whether that is writing in

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,869
French whether that's teaching how to

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,310
use a Raspberry Pi whether that's doing

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,259
something for a school project or

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,759
whether you cheat you're changing what

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,740
you want to do every week it really

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,689
doesn't matter but you're pursuing

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,490
something that interests you and that

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,369
gives you the passion and the dedication

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,240
to be able to start sharing what you're

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,640
doing right we're all teachers anybody

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,009
that's done something for a little while

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,490
becomes somewhat of an expert or slowly

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,350
starting to become an expert so share it

00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,630
talk about it come up on stage next year

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,880
and do this talk right it's only five

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,700
minutes come on I think you can do five

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,020
minutes right you can slowly approach to

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,780
the point where you're doing 45 minute

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,340
talks you can also just write about it

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,119
open source comment be more than happy

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,259
to have you coming right about it right

00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,829
sharing is caring that's what we talk

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,829
about right

00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,120
and when we do stuff like that how long

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,460
have you been here three days now right

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,100
three days so if you're gonna run around

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,440
have you been talking to people I've

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,470
been learning new stuff have you been

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,850
sharing you got some new ideas to go

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,130
home and start trying some stuff and

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,470
start sharing some stuff this is the

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,820
most important thing the big challenge

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,080
is how long have you been working at

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,910
open source how many people have been

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,410
working in anything that's really

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,750
interested I'm on the side for more than

00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:40,180
a year put your hand up two years three

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,970
years four years five okay you people

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,320
that five how much are you are sharing

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,620
how many people writing blog articles

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,270
how many people are doing meetups how

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,120
many people are just at their work doing

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,490
little pizza evenings or whatever like

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,020
that trust me there's stuff you know a

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,110
lot about that other people don't want

00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,210
to know about you'd be surprised

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,400
I've been riding in a blog for about I

00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,730
didn't know how many years 2007 you do

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,040
the math it started basically because I

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,300
got tired of searching for the solutions

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,800
that I was trying to use right so I

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,060
start documenting how I did I'm gonna

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,670
put him online I at Red Hat where I work

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,230
I do quite a bit of stuff with JBoss

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,400
it's a middleware a Java you know

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,590
tooling framework whole bunch of

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,959
projects one of the very simple things

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,910
that I wrote a long time ago was how to

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,650
serialize an object and put it in a

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,050
database and how to unsere lies and get

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,610
it out so serializing means you turn it

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,040
into some kind of binary object and you

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,840
put it in there you think that's pretty

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,610
straightforward right I didn't write the

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,040
library I just wrote the class to do

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,440
that put it online wrote the class to

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,440
get it out put it online that is still

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,410
one of my top five visited and I mean

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,410
we're talking about code from 2007 how

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,790
much code you wrote is still alive one

00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,519
year two year three years later right

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,050
they're still looking this stuff up God

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,400
knows why scares me

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,390
I hope my bank is not using that

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,340
software anyway this was a little

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,830
preview the three things that we talked

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,650
about it's been recorded the slides are

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,260
online if you go to my

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,970
Twitter account it's Eric Chapelle one

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,530
word you can find a link to the slides

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,060
are online if you click on this image

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,699
here you can watch the what's the

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,710
YouTube recording of this it was in a

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,620
pretty fantastic venue you'll get to see

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,889
some of it in the recording it was in

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,000
Croatia in their National Theatre so

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,430
imagine you're standing here and you're

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
surrounded by these golden balconies and

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,430
all that stuff you see on TV when some

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
kind of cabaret guy is doing his show

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,139
that was pretty intimidating to be

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,449
honest but anyway it's a really nice

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,250
show I think it's a pretty good talk and

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,000
it has nothing to do with coding as I

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,620
said it's about you it's about sharing

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,400
it's about growing what you know and

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,270
passing it on thank you

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,270
