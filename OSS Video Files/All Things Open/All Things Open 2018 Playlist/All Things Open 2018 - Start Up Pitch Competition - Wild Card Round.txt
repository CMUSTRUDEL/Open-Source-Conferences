as we invite our other companies back up

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,759
onto the stage screen to go glue trigger

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,340
mesh proto Pia and of course already on

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,900
the stage brew view now for the next 15

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,330
minutes or so our judges will have the

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,609
opportunity to ask questions of any of

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,230
these companies who presented today get

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,269
more information prove them a little bit

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,849
more on their business models find out

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,109
more about what's going on and you can

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,970
just address your question the company

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,430
will pass the mic and we will continue

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,270
this for about 15 minutes so judges the

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,270
floor is yours

00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:45,570
boy get in the hot seat here let's see I

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,070
guess a question for glue your this is

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,219
just general Q&A right or just normal

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,989
any anything you want anything okay so I

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,210
am actually really fascinated by this

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,329
authentication authorization space and

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,129
you know I am overall I think it's

00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:01,020
shifting pretty heavily to open source

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,000
and obviously newer newer architectures

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,369
new abstractions as different paradigms

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,520
kind of changed so how are you guys kind

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,080
of like accounting for all of the I

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,380
think you mentioned forgerock

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,659
and peeing you run into and deals and in

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,240
the in the competitive sort of dynamics

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,210
you're saying how are you accounting for

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,630
building a super superior architecture a

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,720
superior go-to-market and a superior

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,780
team in the midst of all that kind of

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,340
competition and fast kind of market

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,140
evolution well so not to be mean to ping

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,930
him for Drock but they're basically big

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,899
sales organizations now ping was bought

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,549
by private equity and they're it's

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,350
they're firing a lot of the senior

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,869
people and replacing them with HP Elle's

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,070
high-performing entry level and

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,560
innovation has really come to a crawl at

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,600
ping for Drock is also has never been

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,729
that fast at innovating so beating those

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,409
guys in innovation is not a particularly

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,740
high watermark for us the glue has

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,090
always been very innovative in terms of

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,890
building the team we've had to be

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,310
somewhat unconventional because of our

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,530
capital so we've basically say we got to

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,130
hire the best people wherever they are

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,530
in the world

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,600
old so we've like wordpress or automatic

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,380
we have a very distributed team people

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,110
and and every you know every continent

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,670
with regard to resources clearly a you

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,500
know one hundred fifty million dollars

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,240
is going to help you get to a market a

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,190
lot and that's where that's definitely

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,210
where we're struggling

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:37,020
we have been marketing primarily inbound

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:40,650
and so we need to be more proactive

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,000
about sales and marketing and sort of

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:48,000
step up the marketing effort a little

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,510
bit but but yeah they do a good job mmm

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,430
my questions for market trigger mesh we

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,680
talk a lot about technology and

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,060
capability and we can all get all you

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,170
know wrapped around the axle about

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,260
what's the next wave of innovation but

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:07,770
my question is if I'm your customer and

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,330
I'm entertaining adopting functions or

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,590
service however we want to refer to it

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,750
what's the problem that I have

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,890
specifically its repeatable across a lot

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,450
of customers for your salespeople that

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,520
you're gonna solve for me that sort of

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,830
pulls me into this world like what what

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,080
makes me take that step and right done

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,840
not just an evolution of architectures

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,990
but really a sort of application or

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,750
business level problem that even walks

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,840
me down this road so at the beginning

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,270
the number one thing is just

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,040
operationalizing this the developer

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,230
workflow so rather than having a

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,209
highly-skilled developer managing

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,550
pushing functions into the cloud that

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,320
provides that automation for for

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,110
orchestrating those functions to

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,840
whatever cloud there is the second thing

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,570
is having reusable code and triggers

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,930
already integrated into the platform so

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,959
otherwise they would have to go

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,160
understand and an engineer what the

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,630
trigger looks like and how they were

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,230
going to kick off their function where

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,599
we're providing you a template

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,299
to automatically add that reuse those

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,120
triggers are and events are are reusable

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:23,260
across all your functions the third

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,090
thing is is really giving all of your

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,010
oversight so now you have individual

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,830
developers doing individual functions it

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,710
gives oversight to your your engineering

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:39,460
management so they can see all of that

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:42,580
workflow in all their clouds so for glue

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:46,560
I found that slide it says if we could

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,940
achieve 80% market penetration we'd have

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,639
42,000 organizational customers I don't

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:59,500
know what year or what what year is that

00:04:51,639 --> 00:05:02,880
slide from July 2018 look at cuz when I

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,850
saw that it's like wow if that's a big

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,280
yeah yeah so if we could do 80% of

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,960
market share yeah I don't know although

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,370
other weird things in the world could

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,350
happen I don't know that want to live in

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,500
that universe yeah but it's good that

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,840
you know it does give you a good feel

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,650
for if you were to do that you do list

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,940
that that would represent 41,000

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,740
organizational customers so that's

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:34,110
probably the context so thank you for

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:37,630
that for green toga so with the

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:40,479
packaging if they are the containers if

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,639
they're being returned what water

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,479
resources what's the impact on water

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,669
resources the we have an environmental

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,050
impact calculator that was built for us

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:55,479
and it compares reusables to star from

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,910
two compostables and recyclables in

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:01,630
terms of everything from manufacturing

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,180
to the use the washing the water the

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,599
electricity all the way to the end of

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,139
its life and no matter how you shake it

00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:14,440
out reusables is a fraction of the

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,599
resources used then compared to the

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,740
others in terms of carbon emissions in

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:24,000
terms of landfill volume and the

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,000
electricity and heat for washing

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:32,110
while you got the mic how do you know

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:36,550
how long you can use a reusable in the

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:40,710
sense of you know health and wellness

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,810
and everything how do you measure that

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,020
so the product we're using now in our

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,420
MVP isn't off the shelf existing product

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,570
that has been around for a really long

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,000
time it's in a lot of the university

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,970
dining halls across the country same

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,460
container and the manufacturer and

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,380
independent studies on the durability

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,240
and longevity of those boxes show that

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,570
they can last on average about a

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,480
thousand uses so one box equals one

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,520
thousand disposables we actually think

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,120
we can do a lot better so we've got some

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,570
industrial designers helping us rebrand

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,000
reuse entirely and create something

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,560
that's built and designed for reuse

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,920
systems instead of modeled after

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,450
disposables and so that's a thing that's

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,040
never been done before and we think we

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:35,350
can really improve the longevity and

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:40,210
durability even more this is for the

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:42,940
review guys beer is really cheap to make

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,150
I mean I think somebody told me one time

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,270
it's like a dime a pint to make it for

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,610
most people at any scale and if I have a

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,400
bar owner and I have a crowded bar I

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,960
know I'm making money and if I have an

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,180
empty bar I know I'm not making money

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,370
and so where does beer inventory

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,100
management fall on the priority list for

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,900
me to spend money on like if I've got X

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,460
thousand dollars to spend a year

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,110
am I gonna spend it on marketing getting

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,940
more people in my bar my in spending on

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,890
inventory management trying to get a

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,160
sense of the urgency of this problem and

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,630
how do you raise the profile of the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,220
problem you're solving to the point

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,889
where it's a must-have rather than a

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,139
nice to happen

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:28,229
yeah that's a great question you know

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:31,080
for bar owners we have one example we

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:33,419
launched Peru view edit account and and

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,829
they had some draft apps and they said

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,959
you know the margins are great on beer

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:38,969
that's why I have it on tap but he said

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,680
I he goes I know I have an issue with

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,260
some of that beer disappearing and in

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,649
just a few weeks after we put brew view

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,700
on his bottle revenue went up by 40%

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,860
because the patrons if they couldn't get

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,209
a free draft then they just they hunt

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,310
this their bar they hem out there and

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,620
they purchased a bottle so I think that

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,050
also ties into if you look at the

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,640
pressure craft beer is putting on these

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,160
bars to increase their number of tap

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,899
handles the cost may be low but the

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,899
revenue produced from one craft beer is

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,670
very high and having the right selection

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,110
on tap having the right maybe there's a

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,880
different grape fruit beers having the

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,380
right one on could be a revenue

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,149
difference of five hundred or a thousand

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,149
dollars a month depending on your bar oh

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,610
and we have another good story we had a

00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,990
customer come to us franchise customer

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,779
and they're there

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,959
their team would lift and shake the kegs

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,269
on a weekly basis and they had one of

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,130
their employees drop a keg on their toe

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:43,380
a full keg so it was it was amputated

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:46,850
shortly after that it got too real all

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,850
of a sudden okay next question

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,530
it looks like our judges are done with

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,350
their questions since we have a few

00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,030
minutes left before we get out give an

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,680
opportunity for anyone the audience to

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,090
ask some questions if you would like to

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,890
ask a question of any of our companies

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,780
raise your hand I'll come to you with

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,360
the microphone and you get a chance to

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,650
be a celebrity judge just like our panel

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,730
here so if you have a question raise

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,200
your hand I will come out and see you

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,960
you realize this isn't television and I

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,210
can see all of you right okay good all

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,000
right got a question back there to ask

00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:28,050
for one or all of our companies who are

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:37,140
presenting here today and your question

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:39,600
is questions for glue I guess for the is

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,760
it too kind of Fed rate is it the single

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,640
sign-on within like like an intranet or

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,640
am I going to try to like basically use

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,230
my facebook credentials to log into my

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,090
workday I mean all the votes okay so so

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,630
the glue server could be used to control

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,690
access to internal websites it can be

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,340
used if a company needs to get access to

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,310
a SAS provider let's say your company

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,410
needs to go to a Salesforce or Google to

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,260
get your mail so we call that outbound

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,060
identity and also we the glue server

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,220
supports what we call inbound identity

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,560
so if you authenticate at Facebook and

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,510
then enter into the site we might

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,600
dynamically create an account for you on

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,760
the fly so the glue server I'd say is

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,870
very flexible in terms of being able to

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:34,320
handle both internal inbound or outbound

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:37,500
identity all right next question for one

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,200
of our companies is back here hi this

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,190
question is for max from proto Pia I'm

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,050
curious about how your platform could

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,810
help economic development through

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,060
empowering entrepreneurs yeah so a great

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,110
question so we actually work right now

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,210
with an economic development

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,980
organization in the Piedmont where

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,780
number one is we're helping multiple

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,570
organizations collaborate that are

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,760
fragmented mentor networks we give them

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,560
insights into who the best individuals

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,420
are to share advice

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,210
and then the third part is really their

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,710
one they want to reach more

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,840
entrepreneurs on the fringes people that

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,390
are Main Street focusing on inclusivity

00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,700
and diversity so you've got a lawyer

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,100
lower the barrier to access for those

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,390
individuals to tap the expertise because

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,250
it's intimidating when you launch a

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,140
business so taking some of that fear

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,300
anxiety off is something where we've

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,900
seen a lot of traction alright next

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:36,270
questions coming here from your left

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:37,650
this one's for Glu softball for you

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,960
you mentioned transitioning your

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,610
business model to an open court is that

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,839
correct yes

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,730
part of that open core are you

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,470
contemplating giving away basically the

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,060
guts for free as a part of the open

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,180
source and then offering like a hosted

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,660
offering similar to an auth to zero no

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,730
actually we are have been really staying

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,550
out of the SAS business for a long time

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,230
because that's dominated by companies

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,930
that have a huge amount of capital and

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,880
we felt like it would be better for us

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,910
to focus on the unprimed market of

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,170
companies who are either really paranoid

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:15,630
or need the clear IP our go with open

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,910
sources to keep the glue server free but

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,860
to charge for components that are really

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,320
only needed by large enterprise

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,300
customers who should be helping us

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,180
support to develop a very expensive

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,610
platform so things like compliance and

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,500
audit really high-end features that only

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,780
enterprises one that's what we're gonna

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,540
hold back but of the community we want

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,130
to continue to serve open source

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,990
constituents by keeping the software

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,180
free and really useful for the vast

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:46,500
majority of enterprises or organizations

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,540
all right ladies and gentlemen please

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,900
give a big hand to our five presenting

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:55,050
companies green to go glue trigger mesh

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,890
which hope you approve you

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,320
and

00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,320
