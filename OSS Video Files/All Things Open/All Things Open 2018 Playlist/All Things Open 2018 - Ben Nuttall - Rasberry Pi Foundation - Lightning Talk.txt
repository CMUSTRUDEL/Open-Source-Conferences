okay so yeah so I'm been docile I'm I

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,690
work at Raspberry Pi foundation based in

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,940
Cambridge in the UK work his community

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,349
manager as Jen said I write for

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,330
open-source comm which is a great way to

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,529
kind of get out there what we're what

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,590
we're up to and what's going on in the

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,689
PI world I also created a project called

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,930
GPIO zero and and something called PI

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,930
wheels

00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:32,250
so although the Raspberry Pi foundation

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,670
was founded in 2008 the first product

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,390
that came out was was launched in 2012

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:42,329
on on day one one thousand one hundred

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,610
thousand units were were sold but only

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,730
10,000 units existed at that point so

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,640
over the next few months we we worked

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,710
hard to to get all that manufacturing

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,870
done and fulfill all those shipments and

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,399
by that towards the end of the year you

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,949
got to a point where you could reliably

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,300
just buy one and receive it next day and

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,800
around this time a lot of community

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,890
stuff started happening around Raspberry

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,659
Pi so people set up something called

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,100
raspberry jams which are community meet

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,960
ups to learn about Raspberry Pi and

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,479
they're generally open to all ages so

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,490
parents can take their kids along you

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,530
know retired electronics hobbyists we'd

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,030
go along and learn about start learning

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,220
about electronics and Raspberry Pi again

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,200
and put in learning programming skills

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,850
and that kind of thing people a group of

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,860
people set up a community unofficial

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,960
magazine called the magpie and they'll

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,280
be more on that later and also lots of

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,590
people started making their own ad on

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,900
boards and cases and all sorts of

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,090
accessories for the PI some of those

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,920
actually became full full-on businesses

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,500
that are still running today making

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,750
making accessories for the PI and

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,259
selling them so 2013 we moved

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,930
manufacturing of the Raspberry Pi from

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,090
China to the UK which is a great great

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,000
achievement did a few minor board

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,710
revisions nothing major and which

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,689
actually sold a million units in the

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,810
first year and by the end of this year

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,860
there were about two million units sold

00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,770
the Foundation's start hiring people

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,989
like that go there that's me

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,920
and we started in 2014 we launched a new

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,420
website where we

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,610
learning resources official

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,150
documentation we launched a teacher

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,040
training program called Pike Adam II

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,720
where we train teachers and get them

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,340
inspired about learning physical

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,360
computing and electronics using open

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,520
source software we also did a few board

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,320
revisions so they the Raspberry Pi A+

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,740
and the B+ came out they were the new

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,880
form factor and released the the B+ was

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,970
the release at the same price as the

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,700
previous product $35 the A+ came out at

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,440
$20 we also launched an industrial

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,959
compute module for industrial customers

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,850
to embed the PI into their products 2015

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,730
we launched the PI to a whole new

00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,739
generation of Raspberry Pi in the same

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,720
form factor as the B+ and fully

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,540
backwards compatible at the same price

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,239
of $35 we added a quad core and made it

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,280
get it gave it a gigabyte of ram the

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
magpie that magazine that I mentioned

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,060
earlier became an official publication

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,800
of Raspberry Pi and we put it in the

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,540
shops you can now buy it but it was as

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,100
it was before you can you can access

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,680
free downloads of the magazine and

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,920
that's still going today we had a first

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,500
person in the u.s. Matt Richardson we

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,810
merged with code club a group that a

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,120
volunteer led clubs around the world for

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,620
teaching kids coding skills nothing

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,630
specific to the Raspberry Pi but we

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,480
joined up with them to help them sustain

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,010
those clubs we sent two raspberry PI's

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,820
to the International Space Station the

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,280
end of 2015

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,190
they're running code written by kids

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,459
science experiments written in Python

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,340
and we also launched the pi zero a

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:52,709
five-dollar variant of the Raspberry Pi

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,690
in 2016 we launched our Pi calamy

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,510
program in the u.s. so training American

00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,299
teachers we launched the Raspberry Pi

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,620
desktop a new a new nice looking skin

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,780
for the Raspberry Pi lightweight desktop

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,420
theme and we also launched that launched

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,100
that for x86 so you can launch it you

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,320
can run that operating system on your PC

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,530
the same way you would and on on your PI

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,150
we launched the PI 3 which became which

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,859
is our kind of the main the main

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,049
generation of Raspberry Pi today and

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:25,020
2017 we we launched the Raspberry Pi 3

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,729
B+ which is a revision on that we

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,540
launched two new magazines hello world

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,050
for

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,390
or for a magazine for educators a hack

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,100
space and magazine for modern makers we

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,920
merged with coderdojo who do after

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,630
school out of school clubs as well we

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,560
launched a new project site and launched

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,840
officially launched Raspberry Pi

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,870
foundation in North America so I said

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,210
Raspberry Pi B+ was 2017 was 2018 we

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,580
launched the the PIO e hats a power of

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,310
Earth and a board for the PI and we did

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,170
we celebrated our 6th birthday with the

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,480
Raspberry Pi a big birthday weekend we

00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,780
launched a Scout badge the digital maker

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,460
badge in the UK and coming up in 2020 19

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,290
just to finish off raspberry PI's

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,420
seventh birthday is going to be

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,070
celebrated in March around the world and

00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,320
we have an event called coolest projects

00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,670
where which is a technology fair for

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,120
young people to demonstrate their

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:21,910
projects thank you

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,910
