some other benefits that we get our

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,129
privacy because we don't have to upload

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,480
all the photos to Watson over the

00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:19,320
Internet it's all locally on your device

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,929
so it's secure

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:28,199
so what Watson is bringing to the table

00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:31,689
is we allow you to Train custom models

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,899
you can download already pre-built

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:37,329
models on the Apple website to do image

00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:39,910
classification but the results you're

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,719
gonna get from that is very general so

00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:46,359
for example if you with a the pre-built

00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,280
model you'll get something like car

00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,320
wheel if you feed it this image but if

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,539
you train your own custom classifier you

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,680
can get more specific details like

00:00:52,539 --> 00:01:02,800
broken windshield minor dent flat tire

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:05,680
etc and then again here with the general

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,509
model we can get shoe but if we train

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,299
the model ourselves they can teach you

00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:14,170
things like what adidas nikes or New

00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:18,610
Balance shoes look like and with fruit

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,729
we can train it to detect how how ripe

00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:27,939
the fruit is versus just that it's an

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:32,710
avocado and the way we do that is really

00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:35,799
easy we have Watson we upload it our

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:41,649
training data and it gives us an ml

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:45,369
model and in the iOS we have also

00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:48,430
provided an SDK and so it makes it even

00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:50,860
simpler instead of having to download

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,939
the model onto your laptop drag it into

00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:58,329
Xcode and rebuild your app every time

00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,369
you want an update to your model and

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,619
then have to redeploy the app to the App

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:05,829
Store that can be a little bit tedious

00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:09,130
so in our SDK you can actually just put

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,050
in your models ID and it'll

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,160
automatically download any changes that

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,900
you make to the model on the cloud on

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,720
the button device whenever the user has

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,180
Wi-Fi so you don't have to redeploy your

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:26,120
app every time you want to make a change

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:37,550
to your model yeah and I think so we can

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:41,120
get started with the workshop awesome

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,330
so if everybody could go to this URL we

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,100
can just get started I'm gonna go right

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,980
alongside you guys and work through the

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,810
workshop so we can all stay together if

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,660
at any point you have any questions just

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,510
raise your hand and Nick or myself or

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,730
Josh in the back here will come and help

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:08,210
you out and I won't make sure everybody

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:10,970
gets through it so from that URL I'll

00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:13,450
put it back up real quick if if anybody

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,450
needs it

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,490
you'll see a few options at that website

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,450
and we want to go to the advanced models

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,190
advanced tutorial single model don't

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,890
worry about advanced it it's not really

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:43,470
that advanced it just we go into a

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:45,150
little bit more detail so who has ever

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,250
heard of something called Carthage

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,400
it's a package manager for for iOS

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,160
nobody

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,070
ok so I'll assume everybody nobody has

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,110
it installed already we're gonna want to

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:02,280
get that going our app relies on it so

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,440
that we can pull down our SDK so if we

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,350
go to the requirements tab which is the

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,560
the second page it'll tell you how to

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,990
install it you can just click it and in

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,700
download it right there we're gonna be

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:18,239
meeting that so if everybody could just

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,870
get that going off the bat it'll help a

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,870
lot later on

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,970
and again for anybody who's sitting in

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,979
the chairs you don't have to but if you

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,690
would like to sit at a table it might be

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,030
a little bit easier typing and all that

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,569
stuff it looks like we're getting power

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,569
now so

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:56,009
and this website will always be up if

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,990
you want to go through it again on your

00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,990
own time later still free

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,310
so the application that we're gonna be

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:27,319
developing today is we're gonna create a

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,330
custom classifier that can identify

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:34,669
different types of cables USB HDMI VGA

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,349
things like that so we're gonna have

00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:38,870
some up here that you guys can use to

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,599
take photos but I just want to really

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:45,110
briefly talk about what it takes to

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,000
create a custom classifier so obviously

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,330
we're gonna have to create our training

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,490
data now with visual recognition when we

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,009
create a custom classifier we're using

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,789
something called transfer learning

00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,560
essentially what that means is we

00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,719
already have this really big model

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,509
that's pretty good at identifying

00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:04,460
objects kind of at a high level now what

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,430
we're going to be doing is creating our

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,520
own training images for example we'll

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,360
take photos of USB cables and

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,370
essentially we're gonna give that to

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,949
Watson and it's gonna retrain on that

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,259
specific segment of photos and it'll

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:23,389
create a new classifier that's really

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:26,060
good at identifying those objects now to

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,250
give you some details in order to create

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,590
a custom classifier you need at least

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,190
ten photos of the object that you want

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:39,650
to classify but of course you can take

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:42,259
more if you would like to so in this

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,319
example we are creating a custom

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:48,469
classifier for hdmi cables and you'll

00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,969
notice that we're taking photos from a

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:52,550
variety of different angles with

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:55,610
different backgrounds some include the

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,800
hand and the fingers some don't so you

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,779
really want to think about when I'm

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,550
going to be using this classifier what

00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,740
kind of environment will it be in and

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,740
you you kind of want to train for that

00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:15,289
and the more variety you give it the

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,080
better your classifier will be so we

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:20,330
have some cables this will be the first

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,759
thing that we do just so we can gather

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,550
all of the data at the front end and

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,270
then we can just start using it so since

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,459
we have plenty of time there's some

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,940
cables over here and what we want

00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:37,670
everybody to do is take the HDMI cable

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,520
for example take about 10 photos take

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,800
about 10 photos of the USB cables and

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,310
just have them handy for your own

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,950
personal use that we can train our own

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,710
classifiers in a few minutes so they're

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,090
over here at the table if you want to go

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,300
and grab them share them with your

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,940
neighbors take like I said 10 photos

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,530
minimum think about you know maybe

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,590
taking some with the table in the

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:06,800
background maybe some with the carpet

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:10,180
you know get creative to create a

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,180
variety of photos

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,560
yeah

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,719
so they don't have to be that I would

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,289
say that you'll get the best results

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,860
when you do crop it down because you'll

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:48,960
be kind of minimizing the extra data so

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:59,960
in general you would be kind of

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:59,960
minimizing it to the actual object right

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:43,989
so I'm noticing not everybody is is

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:48,850
going to to take photos are very eager

00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:51,879
to do that so if if you want to just

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:56,439
download a training set if you go to

00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:58,660
that URL IBM dot biz slash connector -

00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:02,980
images you can download a data set

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,269
that's already been taken for you if you

00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,579
if you want to take your own feel free

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,779
but that's a little shortcut if you'd

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,779
like to to do that

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,570
so if you go to this URL and you

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,480
download it you'll find a zip file and

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:47,280
within that zip file is another set of

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,580
four or five other zip files don't

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,970
unzip each of those just unzip the first

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,970
level

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,500
so does everybody have the images or

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:39,460
maybe working on taking photos one of

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:44,120
the two yes yes yes all right we will

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:47,300
we'll just move along then so the second

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,770
thing that we're gonna be needing is an

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,180
IBM cloud account this is what we're

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,710
gonna use so that we can create our

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,380
services and then create our custom

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,600
classifier so from the register your

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,990
accounts page if you just click the IBM

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,550
cloud that'll take you to register in

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,390
addition to that if you would like to

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,460
deploy it to an iOS device you will need

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,160
an Apple ID so if you already have one

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,790
that's good if you need one go ahead and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,790
register for one

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,769
and after you go through the sign up it

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,170
should email you a confirmation and just

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:36,050
you know everybody should know how to

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,050
create an account yeah

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:47,990
yeah so the the URL that I put up

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:55,940
initially the IBM vias URL um that'll be

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:59,920
up and you can access that anytime sure

00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,920
here I can actually pull it up for you

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:29,529
all right anybody having issues creating

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:33,070
your account know how you do all right

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:36,779
Nick will help you out everybody else

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,779
good all right

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,810
so the next thing we're gonna do is

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,540
we're actually gonna dive right into

00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,290
Watson studio which is the sort of

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,760
environment that I mentioned previously

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:54,149
if you go to the create your new

00:14:50,760 --> 00:15:00,360
projects it's the fifth page the URL at

00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:03,649
the top will open up Watson studio and

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,649
it'll look something like this

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,350
now the first thing that we're gonna

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,180
want to do just to make sure that we

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,000
have all the tools necessary that we can

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,470
just get going is up here in the top

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,590
right corner you should see your

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,010
initials if you click that and go to

00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,010
settings

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:38,740
now I already added it but you should

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,780
see an option to add apps and you're

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,260
gonna want to click that and add Watson

00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,260
studio

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:24,500
no it is browser-based so

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:41,650
so after you add Watson studio to your

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:43,210
account we can just go back to the first

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,730
page if you just click Watson studio

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,150
it'll take you there and what we're

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:52,020
gonna do is click new projects we are

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:56,500
going to select the basic option and

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,710
then hit OK we need to give it a name

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:03,900
we'll just call this my first project

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,900
and then click create

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,010
so after it creates the project you

00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:26,510
should see something like this

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,789
now there's two tabs that I really want

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,529
to point out this is primarily I would

00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:33,020
say the most important tabs in the

00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:40,429
entire dashboard the first is the

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:42,649
settings tab now what we want to do is

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,840
make sure that Watson tools are added

00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:46,279
this will just give us access to some

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,059
additional tools that we want to use

00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:53,919
when working with Watson services after

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,919
you check the box just click Save

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:01,659
okay and Nick can help you get those

00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,510
so now that we have added that still in

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,500
the settings tab now we want to add our

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:26,740
visual recognition service so if you

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,960
scroll down about halfway you'll see an

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,710
item that's labeled associated services

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:37,690
right now we don't have any but if you

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:40,030
click add service select Watson this

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,640
will open up a page of our catalog of

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:48,070
different Watson services that you can

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,560
add so if you scroll down you should see

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,100
visual recognition as an option we're

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,100
gonna click Add

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,470
yeah so in the settings tab and then

00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:13,340
scroll down about halfway and you'll see

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:20,629
associated services and then click Add

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:23,029
service and select Watson and then after

00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:29,019
that scroll down towards the bottom and

00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:31,759
you'll see visual recognition click Add

00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:33,799
now I already have an instance running

00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,960
and I'll just select that but since you

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,570
don't you're gonna want to select the

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,409
light option which is our free tier and

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,409
then just click create

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,130
so now in our associated services you

00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,200
should see your instance of visual

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,200
recognition for your project

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,980
now the second tab that I mentioned is

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:13,140
like kind of the most important part of

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:15,360
Watson studio is the assets tab so if we

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,890
go in there we can see right now there's

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,950
nothing but this is where all of our

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,420
data will live our models will live so

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,410
you'll see that our data assets are

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,410
empty right now

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:35,610
if you click browse on the right hand

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:38,190
side the files that you downloaded or

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,350
maybe you took them yourself you're

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,910
gonna want to navigate there and you'll

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,980
see that I have these four zip files

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:48,300
HDMI mail thunderbolt USB VGA and we're

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,280
actually just gonna select all of them

00:20:48,300 --> 00:21:00,980
and click open and it's gonna begin to

00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,980
add them to my project it's gonna try to

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,980
let's try Adam

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,870
so if you have any problems and you get

00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,029
this kind of pop up if you just say

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:41,179
create new it'll try and add it again

00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:43,429
and add it there so now we have our data

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,600
assets and these are our training images

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,269
that we're going to use to create our

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,929
custom classifier for VGA Thunderbolt

00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:53,960
HDMI and USB so now they live in our

00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,419
project and we want to use them

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,059
so again from the assets tab we're just

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:02,419
gonna scroll down towards the bottom and

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:07,549
you'll see a models section and we want

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:09,950
to create a visual recognition model so

00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,570
if you just click the new create new

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:19,009
visual recognition model it'll take you

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:21,889
to this page so first we can rename it

00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:23,659
instead of calling it default custom

00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:32,809
model we'll call it

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:34,250
connectors model and now you can see on

00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,889
the right hand side we have all of the

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,750
assets that we just uploaded and then we

00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:42,139
have in the middle an area where we can

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:47,090
create classes so first I'm going to

00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:51,769
create a class and call it VGA and then

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:54,259
on the right hand side I will just drag

00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:57,950
it in and add it to that new class that

00:22:54,259 --> 00:23:00,440
I just created and you can see it's

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:07,250
adding them and now I'll create one

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:09,519
called Thunderbolt and drag that in

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,519
again

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:32,470
and you can do this for each one of

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:32,470
those zip files HDMI drag it in

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,440
and then USB

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,990
do you mean if you just created one

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,080
class and added them all into it

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,990
it would it would generally classify any

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:03,900
connector as whatever you called it

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:05,430
so you just wouldn't be specific and and

00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,860
at that point you might as well just use

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:10,670
the the general model because you would

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,670
yeah

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,510
I'm sorry I missed ham

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,289
mm-hmm so it's not a requirement it's

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:40,409
more of a suggestion it'll make your

00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:40,409
training images better but yeah

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:57,280
so is everybody good up to this point

00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,690
everybody's tracking that wants to yes

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,690
no yeah

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,480
and what do you mean

00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:31,800
like other services that you can use I

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,920
haven't used any of them I think you can

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,920
probably do it with AWS as well but yeah

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,660
so after you've added your training

00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,900
images to the specific classes that you

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:57,490
created the Train model button will

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,780
become available and if you click it

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,820
it's gonna start training so now it's

00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,070
training your custom model based on

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,970
these classes and the training images

00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,970
that you provided it

00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:23,590
so at this point while it's training

00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:25,810
it's gonna take a couple minutes we can

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,700
go ahead and get started with our iOS

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,970
app that's actually gonna use the custom

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,630
model now also just to provide some

00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:37,330
context training this classifier will

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,550
take a couple minutes maybe five minutes

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,850
a mak'st and it depends on how many

00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:44,530
classes that you're creating but to give

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,840
some context if you were to try to do

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,360
this on your own you would need probably

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,670
a thousand times more photos than then

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,990
we've provided it and it would take

00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:58,500
hours on the order of hours rather than

00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,500
minutes

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,000
well because if you were to try and do

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,570
it yourself you would have to train and

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,250
build the entire model using Watson

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,659
visual recognition like I said we're

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,510
using something called transfer learning

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,580
so rather than having to retrain the

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,679
entire model we're just retraining it on

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:38,110
that specific subset of images at the

00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:39,909
end yeah that exists somewhere but it

00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,419
doesn't necessarily concern us when

00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:46,380
we're creating our custom classifier it

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,380
just kind of exists

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,320
it's essentially a label yeah

00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:25,320
it is okay so it it's learning from

00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:29,360
these training images what an HDMI cable

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,360
is what that connector looks like

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,700
No

00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,600
all right so it's still training and

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:22,000
let's go ahead and start working on our

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,650
iOS app so it's already built so you

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,280
don't have to write a ton of code but we

00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:29,590
do need to get the code and so if you go

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,100
to the 8th page it's called getting the

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,990
code and you're gonna need to open up

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:40,020
terminal and use git

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,020
in order to clone this repository

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:28,170
so after you've cloned the repository

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:32,120
we're going to change directory and

00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,120
actually go into that one so

00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,739
yeah

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,299
is everybody still waiting for the get

00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:52,299
clone

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,270
is anybody else having issues with get

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,270
or everybody's good

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,820
all right I'll swim everybody's good so

00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:27,150
we're gonna change directories so just

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,800
CD into the visual recognition with core

00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,800
ml directory

00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:47,040
and once you're in there you're gonna

00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:53,040
want to call this Carthage bootstrap

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:57,110
platform iOS that's also in the tutorial

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,110
if you just want to copy and paste it

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:08,510
and what this is going to do is pull

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:08,510
down the SDK so we can use it in our app

00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,019
it might take a few moments with the

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:43,669
network is anybody having issues with it

00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,909
is it a little bit slow or is it working

00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,909
is it

00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,930
Oh

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,620
is everyone good is it still working

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,940
no okay all right we'll hang tight

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:25,929
what's that

00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,770
I'm sorry mr. quest

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,050
I still can't hear I'm sorry

00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:13,819
yeah so it's pulling down the Watson SDK

00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:17,470
and it's building it for our project so

00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:17,470
it's available to us

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:39,130
okay

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,780
did it finish for anybody or everybody's

00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,780
still waiting

00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:23,840
so after it's done training you can test

00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:28,250
it in the browser and that's a decent

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,840
indicator of if it succeeded or not it's

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,270
not so much a matter of if the training

00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,190
succeeded because it's gonna train on

00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:38,240
whatever you gave it it's more a matter

00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:40,190
of your custom classifier is only as

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,290
good as the training data so only as

00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:47,630
good as the images that you gave it and

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:51,050
so sort of as a I guess a rule of thumb

00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:53,150
is that for example if you're building a

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:57,110
classifier that you're going to deploy

00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:59,960
to iOS devices it's generally good to

00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:02,090
think about the quality of the images

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,310
that are going to be provided so if you

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,870
know it's gonna be on an iOS device it's

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,230
a good idea to take your training images

00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,400
with an iPhone because that's the

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,880
hardware that your users are going to

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,870
use so if you can kind of eliminate some

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,880
of these subtle differences for example

00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:24,490
if you took it with you know

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,490
high-definition Edition like HDR camera

00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:29,690
the images will be slightly different

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,430
than with my iPhone so if you can kind

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,580
of remove those factors that will

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,640
improve your classifier if that makes

00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,640
sense

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,440
well I mean like I said there's a tab

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:54,020
where you can test it and that would you

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,020
know be an indicator of the quality

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,840
No

00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:23,459
I don't believe so I don't think so

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:40,390
yeah so as you can see mine just

00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:42,460
finished if I were to add more photos if

00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,470
I uploaded more to my data assets and

00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,900
then I you know added some more photos

00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,000
to HDMI it would give me an option to

00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,560
retrain the model and that's sort of

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,140
what Nick was pointing out earlier is

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,230
that there's this concept of continuous

00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:58,960
learning so after I deploy my app into

00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,000
the App Store and I have it using my

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,220
classifier I can actually on the back

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,450
end add more photos improve my

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,520
classifier and retrain my model and my

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,500
users will get that update as soon as I

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,600
want them to without having to push a

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:22,480
full update to the application to the

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:23,740
App Store but also to I think the

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,890
question you're asking is if you could

00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,520
retrain it from the phone so you could

00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:33,790
use the SDK to retrain the model I'd say

00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,440
in general that's probably bad practice

00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:38,020
to give your users that much control

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,550
what you would want to do is take that

00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:44,980
say what your users taking a photo of a

00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:47,710
USB cable and it's classifying it as

00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,720
HDMI which is clearly wrong you would

00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,150
probably want them to upload that photo

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,370
somewhere else and have somebody on your

00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,830
team kind of verify oh yeah this is

00:41:54,370 --> 00:42:00,640
wrong it should be reclassified and add

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:02,050
that to our retraining data but I mean

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,200
you could from the phone if you wanted

00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:07,540
to but you might end up with a poor

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,020
classifier if people are just adding bad

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,020
images

00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:20,400
so has anybody is Carthage finished

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:23,940
building 1 2 3 oh you have pretty much

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,630
everybody it seems alright so that's

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,420
good if you're still waiting no worries

00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:32,490
as you can see my model just finished

00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,770
training I would assume most everybody

00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:37,589
else's either finished now or will

00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:44,549
momentarily which is good we're going to

00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:48,450
be using that so now from the command

00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:52,819
line in the same window you say opens

00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:56,339
and then space period it'll open the

00:42:52,819 --> 00:43:04,530
Finder window and we're going to open

00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:08,520
the core ml vision Xcode project which I

00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:11,430
already have open the main file that we

00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,400
are going to work with is the camera

00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:17,069
view controller now don't worry about

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,640
all the code necessarily it's already

00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:19,710
been built

00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,309
we just need to modify it for our

00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:26,549
specific use which is using our own

00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:30,089
model so you'll see here it's looking

00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:32,000
for something called a model ID and then

00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:36,359
if you go to this other file called

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,029
credentials dot P list you can see that

00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,400
there's another space where you can add

00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:43,140
your API key so those are the two items

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,520
that we'd need to add and then we can

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:49,799
actually use our classifier so I'll show

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,069
you where to find those two pieces of

00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:52,069
information

00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:05,980
so for starters from this window you can

00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,190
see under our model name it says

00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,790
associated service and if you click the

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,790
name there

00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:26,200
it will take us to this page so if we

00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:29,020
scroll down you can see the model that I

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,359
created connectors model now if I just

00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:36,460
click the copy model ID that's what we

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,290
need and if we go back to Xcode you can

00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,119
see we're passing it an array of strings

00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,920
of our model IDs you could give it

00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:46,660
multiple model up IDs if you had

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,530
multiple but since we just have the one

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,240
I'll just put it right there now the

00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,160
reason why you might use multiple

00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:00,430
classifiers is sort of like in the

00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:02,290
example where Nick showed a flat tire a

00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,099
cracked window you would probably have

00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:08,410
multiple models to identify different

00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:11,800
severa T's of damage so you might have

00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,960
one model that just identifies damage at

00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,750
a high level whether it's a flat tire a

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,030
cracked windshield a dent whatever and

00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:22,630
then you would have specific classifiers

00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:25,359
that would identify oh this is a small

00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,880
crack a major crack you know different

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:34,960
severa T's of windshield cracks for

00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:38,140
example so we pasted our model ID there

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,750
and now the last piece that we need to

00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:45,780
make our app run is just to get the API

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:48,670
key so we go back to the web browser and

00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:54,010
scroll up there's a tab called

00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:55,780
credentials if you don't see anything

00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,849
here you can just click new credentials

00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:01,210
and it'll create new credentials for you

00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:05,619
I already have some and so we'll just

00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:11,589
expand it and you'll see an element

00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:15,820
labeled API key we'll just copy that go

00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:19,320
back to Xcode and then paste that into

00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,320
our credentials dot P list

00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:31,369
so now this tells ya

00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,029
yeah

00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,100
so now we're telling our application how

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,700
to log into our account and specifically

00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:57,770
which model to to use and that's all we

00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,190
need so now you can click the run in

00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:03,430
build and this will use the iOS

00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,430
simulator

00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,960
so it's starting the app it's compiling

00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:35,180
the model and downloading it from Watson

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,830
studio and now it's ready to go

00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,900
so there's a couple things if I were to

00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,650
retrain the app and I wanted to update

00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,869
it there's a button here that would just

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,970
grab it again since it's up to date it

00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:51,050
saw that and it just stopped because

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,050
there's nothing to update

00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:03,339
yep

00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:06,400
and and this is just an example if you

00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,540
were to deploy it into your own app you

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,490
probably wouldn't have a button that

00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,630
explicitly said update because you

00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,430
probably wouldn't want your users to

00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,500
have to worry about that you would

00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,000
probably just have it passively kind of

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,369
look to see if there's an update in the

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:24,280
background and then fetch it for them so

00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:28,570
now we can test it so if you click on on

00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:31,930
the other button this will bring up the

00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:36,160
photos and I already have a photo of a

00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:39,730
USB cable and you can see almost

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,619
instantly it was able to identify with

00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:45,750
you know eighty percent confidence that

00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:50,200
it is in fact a USB cable and it's not

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:52,660
anything else now eighty percent

00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,480
probably doesn't seem like great but

00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,670
remember we only passed it a few photos

00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,480
if I really wanted to improve it I would

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:04,869
pass it you know tons more training data

00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,520
I would probably not use photos from one

00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:10,210
or two different scenes I would probably

00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:14,200
expand it for example in this example I

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:18,089
didn't have any training photos that had

00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,089
my keyboard in it for example so

00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:44,390
so does everybody have the app is

00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:53,080
working on building the app does anybody

00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:53,080
need help getting that going okay

00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:11,899
Oh so instead of taking a photo you want

00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:15,499
to just identify it so you would just

00:50:11,899 --> 00:50:17,089
have to build that yourself yeah so in

00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:19,729
this example we're just giving it a

00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:22,939
single photo but you saw how fast it was

00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:25,699
and so you could build your app such

00:50:22,939 --> 00:50:27,679
that it just extracts the frames and and

00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:30,349
is classifying it kind of on the fly

00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,779
like that and that's sort of how you

00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:37,689
would do video and kind of reach that

00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:37,689
sort of real-time classification

00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,660
yeah

00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:12,059
so it's actually not making a network

00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:14,130
request um since yes so since we built

00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,289
the model as a core ml model it's

00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,240
actually running on the hardware which

00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:20,549
is how we get you know near-instant

00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,170
classification because it's not sending

00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:24,990
any network requests at all

00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:27,119
I you can't do it in the simulator but

00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,720
if you were to go you know airplane mode

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,720
it would still work

00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,599
exactly yeah the only time you need to

00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:50,990
make a network request is to download

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,700
the model or update the model and and of

00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,769
course if you were training it you need

00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:58,420
a network request to to provide it but

00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:58,420
that's sort of separate

00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:14,109
No so right now in terms of like running

00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:17,539
on the hardware it just supports core ml

00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:19,519
you could use it from Android using the

00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:21,529
REST API and just point it to your

00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,009
specific custom model but it's not

00:52:21,529 --> 00:52:24,009
offline

00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:49,680
so we still have about 30 minutes does

00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:54,900
anybody have any other questions or

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,900
needs additional help yeah

00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:15,780
yeah so you can the limitations between

00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:18,510
the free and the paid version of visual

00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,790
recognition is is just how many

00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:22,380
classifiers you can create I forget what

00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,620
that limit is I think you can make two

00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:27,750
custom classifiers in the free version

00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:32,360
and the light plan and then beyond that

00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:32,360
you have to switch to a paid model

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,680
sort of the other benefit along the

00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:45,820
lines of payment is that when you are

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,850
utilizing the model as a core ml model

00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:51,690
you're only charged for training because

00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:55,600
you can't really charge for passively

00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:58,210
classifying on the app whereas if you

00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:07,810
were to use the REST API there's a it's

00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:10,480
like a per API call payment plan I would

00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:12,220
have to check I don't believe your

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,850
charges for actually downloading it but

00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:18,300
I think it's just training but don't

00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:18,300
quote me on that

00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:36,670
so does everybody have the the app built

00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:39,330
and running that wants to get the app

00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:39,330
built and running

00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:56,850
so there's kind of a bonus like I showed

00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:59,640
you when we test it you know the the

00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:02,820
classifier is good but not necessarily

00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:07,020
great the confidence score is is high

00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:11,220
but it's not you know it could be better

00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:13,260
right and so if you are so inclined and

00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,960
you and you'd like to kind of understand

00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,780
what improving your classifier looks

00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,880
like now would be a good opportunity to

00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:25,470
take some new photos with the cables

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:28,020
that we have and and and we can show you

00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:29,940
how to actually retrain and improve your

00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:34,310
classifier and you can see it happen you

00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,310
know almost instantly once we retrain at

00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:19,100
Oh interesting and that's just in the

00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:19,100
simulator though okay okay

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,050
so a lot of you might have noticed if

00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:42,119
you just drag and drop one of like the

00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:45,450
stock iOS photos that they give you it's

00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:48,720
extremely high confidence like 90% HDMI

00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:52,190
or something like that and so the reason

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,430
that is is because we didn't provide a

00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:58,349
negative data set for our training and

00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,470
what the negative data set does is it

00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:03,780
kind of tells us tells the model what

00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,910
we're not looking for so if you if you

00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,720
just show it some pictures of the HDMI

00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:11,640
cables it doesn't really know what you

00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,800
want it to focus on whenever you're

00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,170
showing an HDMI it might think you're

00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,300
talking about the background or your

00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:19,140
hand so it doesn't really know what to

00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,980
focus on

00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:25,770
so we want to upload photos that are

00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:27,960
kind of visually similar to HDMI cables

00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:30,359
like ropes and things like that and also

00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,210
things that are in the photos in your

00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:35,250
training data like the backgrounds in

00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,099
your hand and put those all in the and

00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:39,060
the negative set so it can kind of

00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:41,520
understand a little bit more what you

00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,930
want it to actually focus on and to kind

00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,089
of demonstrate that we're gonna play a

00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:51,000
little game so I'm going to show you a

00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:54,530
series of images and try and remember

00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,280
what they look like and then yeah so

00:58:54,530 --> 00:59:04,730
this is a remember what it looks like

00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,730
this is B

00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:18,460
how many of you think this is a one

00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,460
person how many of you think it's be

00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:27,859
three people come on everybody needs to

00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:33,849
vote who thinks it's a three who thinks

00:59:27,859 --> 00:59:39,619
it's be all right we'll get back to this

00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:46,220
here's another example of B here's

00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:52,880
another example of a here's neither a or

00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:54,410
D also neither a or B and then here's

00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,400
them all together so it's a little bit

00:59:54,410 --> 01:00:04,579
easier and now again who thinks this is

00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:08,809
a all right two people who thinks it's

01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:15,069
be okay most of you most of you think

01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:18,790
it's B it's actually a why is it a

01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,790
because I said so

01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:24,200
it's it's it's not your fault though

01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,630
it's it's my fault as the trainer I

01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:30,799
didn't show you good enough images to

01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:34,220
help you understand what which which

01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:37,430
this would fall under so I get a lot of

01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:39,260
people think that this is B because it's

01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:42,290
at the different angles and the colors

01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:45,859
are similar and things like that the

01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:49,730
reason why it's a and in my opinion is I

01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:52,579
wanted you to focus on the red circle so

01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:57,049
you can see an A they both have red

01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:59,150
circles this has a red circle and B we

01:00:57,049 --> 01:01:02,780
have an orange circle or yellow circle

01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:07,460
and and neither air B it's a pink circle

01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:09,619
and a red square so but that can be kind

01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,020
of hard for you to get by just looking

01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:17,390
at these few photos but if I show you

01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:21,230
this how many of you think this is a

01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:28,580
it's not a trick question cool like all

01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:30,650
of you any bees no good we're humans

01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:33,110
we've been looking at images throughout

01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:34,730
our lives all the time we know kind of

01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:37,460
what's important if somebody holds out

01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:39,440
something and says this is a we know

01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,540
they're not talking about their hand or

01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,720
the background or anything we know

01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,070
they're talking about what we're holding

01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:49,280
but the machine learning model doesn't

01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:51,500
know that so we're kind of just we're

01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,870
forced to just show it lots and lots of

01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,780
images and it can't really give us much

01:01:53,870 --> 01:02:01,250
feedback back of what it's focusing on

01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:02,840
we just kind of have to keep we have to

01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:05,030
we have to think about the kinds of

01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,040
things we can show it to help it kind of

01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:09,380
hone in on what we're actually talking

01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,770
about and one of the ways we can do that

01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:15,080
is by providing a negative data set and

01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,660
in that we could include photos of the

01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,130
hands photos of the backgrounds so it

01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:27,370
can kind of understand that you actually

01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:27,370
are talking about that yes

01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:54,020
yeah so it's the the negative class is

01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:55,460
kind of just like none of the above so

01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,350
if you don't have like future plans of

01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:00,950
supporting other fruits in your model

01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:02,690
then yeah you can add them but you don't

01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:05,540
it's not really like you have a negative

01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:07,550
set for apples and for bananas it's like

01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:13,150
one negative set for like that's none of

01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:13,150
the above make sense and other questions

01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,120
right

01:04:00,149 --> 01:04:05,259
right so what it's actually using is

01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:09,489
neural networks and there's kind of like

01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:11,589
a trade-off graph the the better the

01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:14,589
model accuracy the harder it is to

01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:16,390
interpret the results versus like a

01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:19,329
linear regression it's a lot easier to

01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:21,069
interpret the results but you're not

01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:23,439
gonna get as good as accuracy as you

01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:25,209
would with a neural network so there's a

01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:28,869
kind of a trade-off there but things you

01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:31,569
can do are it is good practice to split

01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:35,289
your data up into a training set and a

01:04:31,569 --> 01:04:37,599
test set and kind of run the test set on

01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:39,969
your on your your model on your test set

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,829
every time and you can put together like

01:04:39,969 --> 01:04:46,539
a lot of people use confusion make

01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:51,759
matrices so that kind of shows the like

01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:54,819
accuracy of that's kind of hard to

01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:58,359
explain but it kind of makes like a

01:04:54,819 --> 01:05:02,799
graph of the what it should be versus

01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:05,349
what it shouldn't be and I can I didn't

01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:09,630
show you pictures of that but and then

01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:09,630
another thing you can do is

01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:50,390
all right so one thing you could also do

01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:54,600
is pass like a rectangle over your image

01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:57,869
and kind of chart down what happens to

01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:01,560
the confidence so if you if you look

01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:03,600
here it's almost impossible to tell what

01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,520
kind of cable that is so you can kind of

01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,350
denote that as an important region

01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:13,109
versus in that photo like our idea of

01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:15,510
what it is isn't hindered so that we can

01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:18,630
label as not important and we can do

01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:22,770
that like a lot of classifications and

01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:29,400
then kind of end up with a sort of cloud

01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:34,609
of what region is important so that's

01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:38,760
another way you can kind of see what the

01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:40,940
what the model is focusing on that make

01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,940
sense

01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,240
and other questions

01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:55,690
right

01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,329
right yeah but it doesn't have to be

01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:06,220
like a negative set of like everything

01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:07,750
because that would be a huge set it's

01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:10,450
it's things that are like visually

01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:16,109
similar to to the object you're trying

01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:19,450
to classify and things that are in that

01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:23,049
classification image that aren't what

01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:28,510
your pacifying and then you can end up

01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:32,440
with like a photo like this it had a

01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:36,670
decently high 76 percent confidence that

01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:40,510
it was USB but if you do that thing that

01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:43,750
I was showing earlier it wasn't actually

01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:49,599
focusing on the ends of the USB it was

01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:54,010
focusing on the the cable part so you'd

01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:57,609
want to upload photos of more cables and

01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:59,500
if it I did another demo where we

01:07:57,609 --> 01:08:02,500
trained it on beach balls and beer

01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:05,920
bottles and whenever I held up the beach

01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:07,720
ball took a photo only my hand was

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,520
highlighted what it was focusing on so

01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,339
then I added photos of my hand to the

01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,890
data set and it was a lot higher

01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:15,250
confidence whenever I took photo of my

01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,870
hand

01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:24,569
it wouldn't say beach ball anymore and

01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:24,569
stuff like that yes

01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:40,279
no right so it's not changing the

01:08:37,089 --> 01:08:44,719
functionality of your app so it's it's a

01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:48,410
okay to use and also another good thing

01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:50,690
to know it's the model file itself it's

01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:52,609
only 13 megabytes and that doesn't

01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:56,259
change like you can upload thousands of

01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:56,259
photos and it'll stay at 13 megabytes

01:08:57,429 --> 01:09:00,429
cool

01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:24,400
any other questions will be here I think

01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:28,900
we have this space for another about 15

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,640
minutes so if you'd like to take some

01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,970
photos of cables that you can use to

01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:36,460
retrain it later or if you want to do it

01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,630
right now we're here to help you it's

01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:42,670
basically the same process that we

01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:44,650
already did just clicking retrain but

01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:47,859
yeah thank you guys for coming hopefully

01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:49,029
you got something out of it and and

01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:56,680
again we'll be here if you have any

01:09:49,029 --> 01:10:00,580
other questions so in the the workshop

01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:06,840
will stay live if you want to go through

01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:06,840
it and once more awesome thank you

01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:11,609
