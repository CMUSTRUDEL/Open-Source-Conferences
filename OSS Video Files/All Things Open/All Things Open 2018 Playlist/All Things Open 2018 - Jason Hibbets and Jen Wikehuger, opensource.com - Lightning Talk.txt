this is Jen I'm Jen I'm an editor and a

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,190
community content manager at open source

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,040

back up oh I don't have the clickers

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,219
here here we go we will get organized we

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,410
have all the speakers organized we're

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,450
just not organized for those of you not

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,829
familiar with open source comm hopefully

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,140
you've stopped by the booth but we're an

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,820
online publication and community telling

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,320
your stories in the open source

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,960
community and one of the things that we

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,699
get asked the most is can I contribute

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,469
can I write for the website for the

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,470
source.com community and the answer is

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,760
yes so you may ask yourself well Jason

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,369
what would I write about and the answer

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,750
is lots of different stuff so we have

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,689
people who are interested in all sorts

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,700
of open-source technologies we also

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,909
share personal stories about working

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,100
with open source and Linux so so we have

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,020
some topics up here to help guide you

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,090
but really it's what are you passionate

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,579
about what open source technologies do

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,990
you use maybe even like how did you get

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,640
started and open source how did you get

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,250
started in Linux we love those personal

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,170
stories as well and then just simple

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,790
introductions to things it can be super

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,409
basic you might think nobody needs to

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,689
read this there's like 20 articles about

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,490
that already out there not so people

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,140
love reading things a million times and

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,270
they like hearing different things from

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,009
different people and you're always more

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,229
than likely gonna fill a gap by writing

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,579
your version of that thing so we really

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,799
encourage you to share your story with

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,390
us so you may also ask yourself well why

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,770
would I want to contribute and we get a

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,420
lot of great feedback from a lot of our

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,700
contributors a lot of our writers and

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,810
authors on why they do what they do a

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,399
lot of times I you just want to maybe

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,500
grow their network grow their portfolio

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,790
or maybe they want to raise a little bit

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,920
more awareness around their open-source

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,970
project we

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,590
actually had some people say that

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,690
because of their contributions and

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,630
writing that has helped them get a their

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,310
latest job and then relay to the other

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,110
big thing is like this is just writing

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,520
for open-source comm is a different way

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,800
to contribute back to the open-source

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,810
community to share what you're working

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,459
on with your project to share different

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,260
techniques tips and tricks or whatever

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,920
it may be so it's that's a way to

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,239
contribute without writing code another

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,040
great thing about writing for

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,470
open-source comm and this is not

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,019
something that all publications offer is

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,260
that we offer fantastic editorial

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:51,049
services so everybody says writing is so

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,760
freaking hard I don't I know I need to

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,290
write I know I need to share I know I

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,299
need to contribute back or I need to

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,310
raise my profile in the community but

00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,799
it's just so hard to write so we offer

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,319
free editorial services send us your

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,540
ideas send us your proposal outline send

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,549
us a draft and we will really help you

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,980
revise that and make it awesome so that

00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,080
you can be proud of whatever we put

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,180
online and we also do this really great

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,239
thing which is we let you see the final

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,250
version before it goes live not

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,070
something everybody does and I know it's

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,000
really appreciated whenever we do it

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,560
yeah like if you ever got interviewed by

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,090
the press and they kind of took that one

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,010
quote that sounded really juicy to them

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,140
but didn't sound so good when you said

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,400
it out loud to them alright we like to

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,109

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,209
