hi everyone I'm Nina Zakharchenko I'm

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,920
really glad to be here today this is my

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,990
first all things open even though I lost

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,630
my voice I'm excited about speaking to

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,240
you today I'm a longtime developer and

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,250
pythonista in the past Everton software

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,160
at companies like Reddit Meetup

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,930
HBO these days I'm really excited to

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,189
have joined the cloud developer advocacy

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,160
team at Microsoft

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,250
it's an incredible team and my focus is

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,870
on making the Azure experience an

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:38,340
absolute pleasure for Python developers

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,899
everywhere today I'm here to talk to you

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,010
about five things you didn't know about

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:49,020
Python a freebie here Python is 28 years

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,120
old who knew that one person awesome

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,309
and according to Stack Overflow it is

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,410
the fastest growing language there are a

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,020
lot of misconceptions about Python from

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,149
the early days things like it's only

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,859
good for scripting it's only good for

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,619
the web these things are just not true

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:08,909
in 10 minutes I'm gonna change your mind

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,799
the first thing you might not have known

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,110
about Python is that it empowers

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,970
scientists and it drives discoveries

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,810
forward

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:21,090
this is Concordia station in Antarctica

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,299
it's extremely isolated there's no Sun

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,340
there for up to three months in a row

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:30,930
it's the closest analog that we have on

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,700
earth to a base on another planet it's a

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,820
research facility that helps us study

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,710
future deep space missions and Python is

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,439
used heavily there it's used for reading

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,189
sensors for processing data for

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,470
visualizations for graphing charts and

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:50,640
experiments such as drilling into ice

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,470
almost two miles underground in order to

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,979
analyze air that was trapped there 1

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,869
million years ago in a keynote given at

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,180
Euro Python the summer the scientist

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,829
shared that they use Python all day long

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,890
and they use it for most of their

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:09,989
programming tasks this means that Python

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,330
might help us go to space one day Python

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,850
is amazing for data science it's used to

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,740
process

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,260
massive amounts of data it's helped in

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,180
breakthroughs all over the world such as

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,270
this particular one in gravitational

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,560
wave astronomy Python was used in a

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,260
variety of ways for this breakthrough

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,810
from operating the detectors to

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,580
analyzing massive amounts of data to

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,910
pushing alerts to the astronomers and

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,800
sharing results there are incredible

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,520
open-source tools like jupiter notebooks

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,110
pandas numpy sie pi pi torch they're all

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,270
amazing tools for artificial

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,620
intelligence and machine learning

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,250
they're all Python and they're all open

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,280
source this year's Nobel Prize winner in

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:54,190
economics Paul Romer he's Python for his

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,260
work paul has an excellent blog post

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,600
where he talks about how the open nature

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,850
of things like jupiter notebooks drove

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,510
the project to success ahead of its

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:08,140
proprietary competitors he says in

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:11,080
science anyone can experiment in open

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,760
source anyone can access the facts of

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,610
the code Python is also used to create

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:23,230
incredible games and art EVE Online is a

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,020
massive multiplayer online game that's

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,610
set in space the client and server code

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,950
are written in a variant of Python

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:33,730
called stackless python that uses

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,400
lightweight threads during its peak of

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,180
popularity it had hundreds of thousands

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,640
of players one of each creator said

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,530
Python enabled us to create EVE Online a

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,560
massive multiplayer game in a record

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,480
time the flexibilities of Python have

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,410
enabled us to quickly improve the game

00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:57,090
experience based on player feedback this

00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,430
is super potato bro it's a platformer

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,410
your baked potato and you're fighting

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,510
against an evil ladle who's trying to

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,980
kidnap all your friends and turn them

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,910
into soup the whole thing is written in

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,800
Python 100% Python and PI game and you

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,980
can buy it on Steam now for about 4

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,980
bucks

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,790
processing is an open source language

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,740
that's geared towards visual art it

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,630
allows you to write incredible

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,910
animations in Java

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,400
but thanks to something called JSON

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,220
which is an implementation of Python

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,860
that runs on the JVM it's an open source

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,710
project and thanks to an open source

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,870
project called processing py you can now

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,950
write code for processing entirely in

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,140
Python Python also lets you automate

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,270
your home your connected home everything

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,390
from your lights to your vacuum cleaner

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,940
to your internet-connected rice cooker

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:58,810
yes that's actually a real thing that

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,360
you can buy with home assistant home

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,060
assistant is an open source automation

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,970
library it puts local control and

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,540
privacy first and we all know why

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,100
privacy is important these days it's

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,680
written in Python it's powered by a

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,460
world of community a worldwide community

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,710
of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts it has

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,420
18,000 stars on github it's perfect to

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,240
run on a Raspberry Pi or on a local

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,610
server it has incredible dashboards and

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:32,260
integrations I highly recommend you

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,180
check it out Python can scale as an

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,980
interpreted language it can be a little

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,900
bit slower than others but the

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,300
advantages strongly outweigh the

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,060
disadvantages it's easy to write it's

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,070
easy to read and development speed can

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,540
sometimes really be more important than

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:54,820
performance Instagram hit 1 billion

00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:57,070
active users that's billion with ABI it

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,530
also features the largest deployment of

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,300
the Django web framework which is

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,700
written entirely in Python Dropbox

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,820
Python powers both the backend and the

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,800
client we know van rossum pythons

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:16,270
creator has worked there since

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,610
approximately 2013 Dropbox engineers

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,560
frequently write blog posts and give

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,250
talks that highlight how they optimize

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,080
Python for performance lately they have

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,300
been moving a handful of performance

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,890
critical services to other languages but

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,160
that doesn't mean that Python is going

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,770
anywhere I like this quote if Python

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,530
didn't work at scale to begin with there

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,000
would be nothing to improve

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:45,910
because Dropbox wouldn't have lasted

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,500
long enough to face this problem lots of

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,600
companies use Python to different

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,910
extents they all have an incredible

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,890
amount of users they all tend to

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,300
gravitate towards having red in their

00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:01,230
logo who knows

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,630
Cora had 200 monthly uniques last year

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:06,790
Netflix relies on Python to power its

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,490
daily data analysis on the server side

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:12,130
and a few other use cases when Netflix

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,020
surveyed their internal engineers those

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,770
engineers decided that they liked Python

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,980
because of its standard library because

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,390
of the active development community

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:25,360
because of the rich variety of

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,090
third-party libraries those were the

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,730
biggest advantages reddit was built on

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,810
Python since 2005 and it has more than

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:37,090
500 million visitors every month that

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:42,700
makes it one of the top five visited

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:45,820
websites in the US many people know that

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,370
Python can run on a Raspberry Pi but

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,290
actually there's a whole ecosystem of

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,220
interesting hardware platforms that run

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:57,400
Python that's because of micro Python

00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,670
and circuit Python there it's a lean

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,680
efficient implementation of Python micro

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,470
Python includes a subset of the standard

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,900
library it has lots of great things in

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,150
it such as an interactive prompt list

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,860
comprehensions exceptionally exception

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,260
handling and a lot more

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,030
it's absolutely optimized to run on

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,680
microcontrollers and that means that it

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,380
fits and it runs with just 616 kilobytes

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,170
of RAM that's incredible

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,150
circa python is an Adafruit port of

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:32,229
micro Python they're both open source

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,660
projects and very very active this is a

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,460
Adafruit trinket m0 that's a tiny

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:40,590
microcontroller board it's as big as a

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:44,370
quarter actually holding one right here

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:47,530
they're very low cost under $10 it

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,450
features a cortex m0 ARM processor which

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,529
is one of the smallest ARM processors

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,930
available

00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:56,709
and this little thing ships with circuit

00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:00,120
Python right out of the box you can plug

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,680
it in and edit a main key wife of

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,410
another Adafruit product I absolutely

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,079
love is called the hollow wing it's a

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,230
spooky development kit with lots of

00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,379
extras it's got a full-color screen a

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,420
light sensor in a speaker a little light

00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,629
poly battery charging and accelerometer

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,730
and my personal favorite feature it has

00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:24,879
for Fang teeth and those are analog

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,399
capacitive touch inputs right there on

00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,410
the bottom there are plenty of other

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,589
hardware platforms that are focused on

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,990
education that run pipe micro Python

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,230
such as the BBC micro bit which was

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:42,790
given to every 12 to 14 year old in the

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:45,910
UK in 2016 with Python you can create

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,920
incredible wearable projects I made

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,490
these earrings using an Adafruit Gemma

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,420
and zero ws2812 LED rings and a tiny

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,420
life Holly battery

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:05,699
see if I can get them on you guys see

00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:05,699
those yeah but my earrings run Python

00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:17,660
yeah the code and circuit diagram is

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,440
available on my github kind of uh see

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,840
the guts here just LEDs on the front

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:31,880
there's a gemma and zero on the back and

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:36,410
a tiny light poly battery there's really

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,380
no time like now to try python it's some

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:42,860
proven with every new release python is

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,380
open at its core it consists of an

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,110
incredibly friendly welcoming community

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,480
there's no time like now to take the

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,610
leap and if you can maybe even consider

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,610
contributing back to the language itself

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,470
if you want to learn more about what

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,930
python is a what Microsoft is doing with

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,140
Python check out this link bit Dahlia

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,060
/eto Python you'll find a link to the

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,680
slides in my Twitter on my Twitter

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,590
account in just a few minutes you can

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,790
