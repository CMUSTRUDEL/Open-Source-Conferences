how are you doing alright there's so

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,219
many people here it's really exciting so

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,830
I am so excited to be here to talk to

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,599
you about design and open source and

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,580
that was a great introduction this is

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,869
who I am on the Internet I'm just at you

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,960
know that's my handle you can find me on

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,609
github Twitter code pen etc as you heard

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,830
I work at bustled digital group as the

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,269
director of product design I'm also a

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,910
Google developer expert in web

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,830
technologies I have a podcast that's

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,170
every other week called tools day about

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,090
tech tools tips and tricks so if you're

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,129
interested in that there's a bunch of

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,280
episodes about various front-end dev

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:43,500
things online and I also started to

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,350
explore other platforms I've recently

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,489
started an Instagram where I'm doing

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,070
illustrations and mnemonic devices that

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,270
web development concepts I was also a

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,570
core member of the open design

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,559
foundation that tried to increase

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,059
designers and open source and that's

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,789
what I'm here to talk to you all about

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,120
today and while I was preparing for this

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,430
talk I was wondering how much did other

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,530
people value design an open source it

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,240
was important to me but I wanted to hear

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,570
about how much other people valued this

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,420
too so I turned to Twitter as one does

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,400
and I ran a little poll and I asked how

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,920
important is design open source just an

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,540
open-ended question and most people 69

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,810
percent said it's very important design

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,659
is key only four percent said me it just

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,000
needs to work so I was so excited to see

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,979
that so many people valued design and

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,710
open source so much as much as I did and

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,570
so I'm excited to be here also at this

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,140
conference full of people who work on

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,640
open source and also value design so I

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,369
want to get a little feel for the

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,829
demographics of this audience as well

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,360
and I want to get a show of hands of how

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,040
many people here are designers or

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,590
developers so before we get into this

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,509
let's practice I want everyone here to

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,549
raise your hand everybody raise your

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,530
hands I want to see everyone's hands up

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,240
okay now wave them hi this is so nice

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,250
anyway put your hands down how many of

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,469
you here consider yourselves developers

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,509
who work on open source ok so that's

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,670
literally almost everyone in this room

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,000
it's crazy season hands up what about

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,910
designers here are there any

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,650
designers here yeah I see a couple so

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,180
there's a whole design ui/ux track which

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,760
is really exciting to see so I see a few

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,280
up here how many of you here work on

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,780
open source full-time or as a part of

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,550
your job you get part of the time to

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,750
work on open source you get paid to work

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,709
on open source from someone your

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,850
employer cool what about designers here

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,400
do you get paid to work on open source

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,220
so you full-time open source okay

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,880
there's two people in here that's more

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,430
than I expected how many of you know

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,100
anybody who's a full time independent

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,810
open source developer so I know a couple

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,880
I contribute to them on patreon they get

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,739
paid for bug fixes other projects

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,209
there's there's a few people I know some

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,770
out there they're out there there I

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,050
really respect them

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,310
what about full-time independent open

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:06,730
source designers I don't believe you

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,640
there's like two hands up anyway so if

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,720
we value design so much as a community

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,110
where are all of the designers and this

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,549
is where I think a discrepancy emerges

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,410
people think that they value design an

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:21,940
open source but in practice we don't see

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,640
a lot of designers in this community as

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,650
you saw maybe 95% of you raised your

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
hand to identify as developers maybe 10%

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,060
of you raised your hand to identify as

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,380
designers probably even less than that

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,100
and I think that this is a two-part

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,560
problem

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,019
part one is that many people still

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,630
either have a preconceived or outdated

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,120
idea of what design is and how it can

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,920
relate to open source or even just

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,110
business and technology in general and

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,760
then part two is that we still haven't

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,310
figured out how to seamlessly blend

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,430
design and development this is sort of a

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,989
workflow problem so how can we bring

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,549
designers into this open source

00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,920
community in a comfortable way that

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,810
aligns with their workflow a workflow

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,090
that's built around our needs in this

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,860
room I think the design community also

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,600
has some things to work out so just

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,820
learning to work more openly but I'm

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,950
here talking to this massive group of

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,070
open source developers about an impact

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,019
that we can have here so first I want to

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,780
tackle part one of this issue and

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,060
discuss what design can really be for

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,410
open source but it can really mean

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,150
design is mathematical and it's

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,090
measurable this is something that

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,970
businesses need

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,760
to understand and leverage design is not

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,490
just visual design is systematic and

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,740
precise design systems drive growth and

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,419
the design thinking process make sure

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,669
that we're building the right tools in

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,470
the first place this is all measurable

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,500
it's not just fluffy and subjective

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,540
 and this is where Design

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,310
Thinking comes in it's an approach to

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,020
pioneer by the Stanford d.school which

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,060
has spread and it's being implemented in

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,970
many workplaces now including somewhere

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,530
that I used to work IBM I worked on the

00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,900
first iteration of an open-source

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,600
project the bluemix design system which

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,180
is now carbon at the IBM design studio

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,700
in Austin Texas and at the studio we had

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,910
visual designers designed researchers UX

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,169
designers front-end developers and every

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,000
single person who started working at the

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,400
studio had a three-month training course

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,350
in design thinking it didn't matter what

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,820
your job ultimately was if you were

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,910
doing user interviews or if you were

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,310
coding all day long we all learned this

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,139
system because it's a product life cycle

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,870
system and everyone can benefit from it

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,150
it highlights design thinking and how we

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,389
can inject design into every aspect of

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,680
the product pipeline and life cycle so

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,030
the steps go as follows

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,500
the first thing that we want to do is to

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,389
empathize with your user and to

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,639
understand the core of the problem

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:46,010
because too often do we jump to

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,840
conclusions the second thing is to then

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,770
define the problem and to give it a face

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,320
with real challenges personas user flows

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,840
scenarios that ideal of what we want the

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,539
user to achieve we then want to share

00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,060
and build upon ideas so this is a really

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,340
collaborative step and then we prototype

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,139
and test and once we've learned from

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,910
these prototypes we build a model and

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,650
test it again and we can measure

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,960
progress here and improve upon that

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,880
system we can see our iterations and how

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,130
they've continued to improve over time

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,950
and this spans to more than just user

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,349
interfaces using this process helps us

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,320
better understand API design or

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:27,320
workflows or how users want to use our

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,300
projects in the first place in the

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,880
open-source community we help people

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,710
with these last steps prototyping and

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,580
testing we contribute to each other's

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,110
projects and fix bugs sometimes or if we

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,080
find bugs we at least

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,670
report them we suggest product changes

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,830
in issues that's why I love that open

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,480
source I can build a library and then

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,760
have someone open an issue on how to

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,500
improve it it's very collaborative where

00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,950
ideating we're prototyping and we're

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,270
testing all the time in real time we're

00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,120
going through a design thinking process

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,430
whether you realize it or not but when

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,740
you don't provide some time and make

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,340
time for those two or even three steps

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,720
then you're not going to get all of the

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,250
results that you can you're kind of

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,320
doing this backwards we're limiting our

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,200
creative scope and we might miss

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,910
something critical because of it this is

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,340
a great slide from Kathy Wang that

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,860
illustrates this really well without

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,780
this abductive thinking our scope is

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,670
limited our solutions are limited

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,710
because of it and this is where the real

00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,320
difference is and we're having a team of

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,870
designers make a much bigger impact than

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,240
we realize when we design products with

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,660
only predisposed solutions to problems

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,030
in our minds we can't help but have more

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,100
narrow outcomes but when we have time to

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,870
think about what's really going on we

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,150
can come up with much more creative

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,010
ideas solutions that can make more of an

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,560
impact and it can improve the product

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,110
more than we originally thought we can

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,120
improve the performance of our sites or

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,190
experience or reduce the time it takes

00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,600
between figuring out what's going on and

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,570
actually getting started with that

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,640
product I'm giving a talk later today

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,560
about how to create successful design

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,050
systems and I think design systems are

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,000
just one example of clear benefits of

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,830
design within a project when I was

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,930
working at digitalocean we had created a

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,690
design system to not only make the UI

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,000
more consistent and prevent visual bugs

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,620
and UI bugs in the site but we also made

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,480
the website more performant while we

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,250
were at it we measured the before and

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,230
after of implementing our design system

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,390
into a new website build and we found

00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,430
these results because we were able to

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,990
reduce code craft with a more

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,330
streamlined design and consistent

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,430
components we cut almost two full

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,370
seconds from the websites time to first

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,740
view the speed index went from 4,100 to

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,360
1,600 and there was no other change in

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,100
the technology or framework of the site

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,680
it was purely just the design system and

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:53,259
redesign we reduced over 2000 rules

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,959
and over 100 unique colors on the site

00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:57,610
we tracked accessibility errors and saw

00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,769
them go down as soon as we implanted the

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:02,319
new design system this is a pally

00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,569
dashboard it's pa-11 Y and it's an

00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,740
open-source tool that you can set up to

00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:08,170
get real-time results for your own

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,509
websites the accessibility of that site

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,920
and all the errors that you have this

00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,119
was a design process that we went

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,269
through and the results speak for

00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,269
themselves

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,470
design defends the user the core of

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,319
product design is to think about the

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,819
user and to be the users voice designers

00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,470
think about how we can give our users

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,959
the best experience possible and how we

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,089
can be as inclusive to our users needs

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,819
as possible to be fair design can be

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,850
exclusive we can create crazy parallax

00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,529
sites and animations and text on images

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,050
but with design we can also be very

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,959
inclusive and ensure inclusivity from

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,149
the start what does this mean this

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,819
manifests in a few ways the first is

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,499
ensuring accessibility ensuring that a

00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,779
website's designs and layouts can be

00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:54,309
navigated by all users regardless of how

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,589
they use their computers whether that be

00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:58,269
keyboard navigation are your roles for

00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,740
screen readers and accessible colors

00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,480
they all fall into this bucket it's a

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,949
really important big bucket to

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,529
understand and think about when you're

00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:07,660
doing design the next is ease-of-use

00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:09,339
how easy is it to get started how

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,439
tangled is the user journey from point A

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:14,860
to point B doing some of that design

00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:16,389
thinking it definitely helps us here how

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,939
easy is it to get started and then build

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,980
upon once we've started an example here

00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:23,439
is a CLI tool or framework or like a

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,790
click to deploy button it's how easy is

00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:26,279
to integrate with github or another tool

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,660
they are expecting a user to use and

00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,579
finally how easy is the documentation to

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,290
even understand the first place how easy

00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:34,059
is it to look back through as reference

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,370
or is it confusing and missing

00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,499
information what happens after the first

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,999
hello world example what happens next

00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:42,309
where does the user find that

00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,139
information when it comes to clearer

00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:47,529
documentation making things more

00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:50,199
understandable for one user make things

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,269
better for every single user where can

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,619
you have interactive demos or diagrams

00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,240
those things help us all

00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:59,290
they help us process information they

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,809
help us with our cognition design is

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,260
what drives adoption design is so

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:04,850
critical an open source

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,980
because design is the very thing that

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,060
drives adoption of most products and it

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,460
could be the thing that makes the

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,660
biggest difference here now I don't want

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,060
to get into nationalistic debate about

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,980
Apple versus Android but it is true that

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,080
the reason that most people who choose

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,940
the iPhone over another device it's

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,490
primarily because of the ease of use of

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,840
its software the user experience the way

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,950
that they don't have to set up their

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,350
phone to their needs it's this

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,090
convention over configuration mentality

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,230
that's helped Apple reach the market

00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,650
share an audience that it's reached

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,990
today even though the technology of

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,850
Android phones often outperforms Apple's

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,130
features forty four point five percent

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,730
of Americans still choose Apple over

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,980
Android the iPhone access is way more

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,810
expensive than the pixel three with the

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,790
worst battery life in an arguably worse

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,880
camera but so many people still choose

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,770
that phone because the software

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,320
experience is better what makes someone

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,750
choose one library over another could be

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,430
that experience layer does it align with

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,050
their development needs that's part of

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,700
it but also how does the developer

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,890
experience work how does the developer

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,810
use the product and how easy is it to

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,870
get started all of these things are part

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,000
of design the SAS community is a great

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,890
example of this SAS is a CSS

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,810
preprocessor which allowed for early

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,240
uses of variables and functions within

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,190
CSS and a lot of other tools like

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,230
nesting declarations now there were a

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,330
lot of other CSS preprocessors at the

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,520
time like less and stylus that

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,530
essentially did the same thing but SAS

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,540
became the most popular because they

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,390
designed the product to their audience's

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,040
needs what SAS did was even though it

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,590
was originally written in Ruby they soon

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,350
provided a CSS like syntax so that style

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,300
sheet writers would feel at home you

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,710
could write CSS files with some SAS

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,740
mixed in instead of having to write

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:51,230
entirely new documents this coupled with

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,170
a building community around the project

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,840
is a huge region for success it's such a

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,330
simple thing but SAS tailored is product

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,240
to its users needs they thought about

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:03,950
the user experience over everything else

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,050
design is not just visual design is how

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,860
your product works design is how you

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,570
enable users to use your product but

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,200
design is not all business there's a lot

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,310
of value and utility in visual design

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,680
even when it doesn't appear

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,360
so design is delightful and having

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,420
beautiful aesthetics makes us happy

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,940
seeing a clean website not only helps us

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,710
cognitively process that information but

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,920
it also just lets us enjoy the time on

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,680
site having a little go over mascot

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,810
makes a smile and gives an emblem for us

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,880
to hold on to an identity as a community

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,890
this little gopher mascot believe it or

00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,020
not drives adoption of the open source

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,520
project golang the stickers that are

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,080
made open up conversations the

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,930
conferences and meetups that happen are

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,300
all branded around this little gopher

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,290
and look at how many there are these are

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,600
examples from all around the world

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,850
there's meetups in Stockholm Pakistan

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,680
London conferences that bring people all

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,440
over the world together there's plushies

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,270
pin stickers illustrations thank you to

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,100
Rene French for designing this gem and

00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,930
Ashlee McNamara for doing hundreds of

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,380
these gopher designs this is some of her

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,779
work here and it's not just go it's

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,610
ember too and react and even github

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:16,580
itself do you know there's an entire

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,470
octo deck of these little octo cats that

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,230
are either submitted they're really fun

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,230
to look at that's so cute

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:27,110
design is so much it's ap eyes and user

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,060
flows but design is also a cute logo

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,880
that makes your product more memorable

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,740
from every angle design is centered

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,730
around human understanding and cognition

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:41,000
how we learn how we remember how we feel

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:44,450
when we use a website a framework a CLI

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,450
an API design is psychological and

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,580
mathematical and silly and fun and we

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:51,740
need design in order to have a richer

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,160
open-source community we need design

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,010
here we need more designers here if

00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,410
you're a designer we need you if you're

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,839
a developer or a project manager we need

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,030
you to introduce your friends to

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,730
open-source get the designers on your

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,920
team involved make time for Design

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,529
Thinking in your open source process

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,940
make time for ID aiming understanding

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,459
the core problem you're trying to solve

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,040
and figure out your user base well you

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:21,050
may think it's you it's not just you and

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,820
like many of you I'm also a developer

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,790
who has built products for other

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,320
developers people never use it like you

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,660
thought they would people will always

00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,550
find other ways to use your products

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,740
and welcome that as an opportunity to

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,830
grow your products welcome designers

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,840
into your process be friendly be open be

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,060
kind designers especially first-time

00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,010
contributors understand that their

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,990
experience is different than yours and

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:49,700
of course not going to understand all

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:52,490
the nuances of get right away because it

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,560
boils down to this right now design and

00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,840
open source is an unsolved problem and

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,210
it can be a chicken vers egg problem

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,040
which came first an open source

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:03,830
development community that wasn't built

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,260
for designers or a design community that

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,510
wasn't predisposed to open source work I

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,120
don't have an answer for that but what I

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,740
do know is this the only way that we can

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,080
grow this community is to introduce it

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,790
to others the only way to grow a

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,550
technical community is to introduce it

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,260
to people who are not already here it's

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,030
great to network with each other but

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,380
make sure that you remember to take what

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,960
you learned here and to teach somebody

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,730
else somebody who isn't here this year

00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,280
but could be here next year

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,950
somebody who wants to help but doesn't

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,140
know how or someone who's never even

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,100
heard of open source before and never

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,260
knew they could be a part of this

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,390
community in the first place we can

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,340
teach each other and we can make this a

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,010
more diverse network of people that are

00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:52,630
building the webs together thank you

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,630
