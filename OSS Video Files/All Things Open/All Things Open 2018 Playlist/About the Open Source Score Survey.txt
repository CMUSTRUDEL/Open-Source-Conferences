maybe you're wondering hey what what is

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,830
the score what's the survey all about so

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,510
I'm gonna attempt to just very give you

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,030
a very brief overview of what the survey

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,820
is in general the survey is 14 questions

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,970
and it's questions really designed to

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,560
gauge or quantify open source process

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,480
experience so we believe open source

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,490
process knowledge is extremely important

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,990
and a survey attempts to do that or

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,480
quantify what your experience or

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,269
expertise might be on a scale of 0 to

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,820
100 and again there are 14 questions so

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,040
you're here at the site and you just

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,630
simply click on take the survey and then

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,090
questions we're gonna go through those

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,920
really quickly

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,050
have you ever contributed to or hosted

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,219
an open source project the estimated

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,980
number of years that you've contributed

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,480
to or hosted open source projects have

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,460
you ever been a member of a core team

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,100

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,399
code into a project are you familiar

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,780
with open source licenses do you know

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,369
the difference between a permissive and

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,990

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,170
