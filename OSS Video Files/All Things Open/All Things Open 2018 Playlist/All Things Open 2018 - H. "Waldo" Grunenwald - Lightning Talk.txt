I folks I'm Waldo eyeballed who

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,240
so unlike the gift debacle where the

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,949
creator intent went out of the way to

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,840
intentionally pronounce it wrong the

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,930
kubernetes community has kind of

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,849
embraced the ambiguity around the tool

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,349
that is the primary touch point for the

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,160
its entire ecosystem what the hell is

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:41,000
that if you ask three people you'll get

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,000
six answers I think we can do better so

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,940
there are a lot of it several easy and

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,700
obvious pronunciations you know for the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,840
first half we can start with Kubb or

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:57,449
cube or coup bay or coup bay and if

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,270
you're under 30 those bottom two are

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,650
sound different for those of us who are

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:09,049
over 30 the the last one is the the

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,049
young person's equivalent of cool babe

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:18,659
of course the second half you can do

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:23,490
control or cuddle or cuttle visual aids

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,670
of course and of course right here right

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,750
off the bat we have 12 different options

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:35,400
you're welcome but there are of course

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:46,220
some less obvious options we can do coop

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:50,479
ekdal or coo bechtel or k you Bechdel

00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,479
and of course no we're not done yet

00:01:50,659 --> 00:02:02,689
Kubek TL Kubek excuse me coup backed l

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,959
but really we don't need to argue about

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,120
this one because this is of course the

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,720
definitive guide what you should do in

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,800
your daily life is put a sim Lincoln

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:23,330
because as Abraham Lincoln said ain't

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,069
nobody got time for that

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,739
thank you I'm Waldo and this is the

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,950
definitive guide to pronouncing that

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,050
tool if you have a preference for one

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,170
that wasn't mentioned I'm sorry

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:42,070
this is definitive

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,070
