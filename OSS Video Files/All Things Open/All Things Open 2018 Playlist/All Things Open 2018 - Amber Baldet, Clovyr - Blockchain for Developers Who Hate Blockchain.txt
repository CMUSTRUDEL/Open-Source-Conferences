	00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,049
patient you know all of a sudden all of

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,429
these things were coming out because you

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,260
needed to understand them to have a

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,210
robust blockchain program and that's

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,469
amazing and so if you're part of an

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,170
organization that has a blockchain

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,050
program I would say latch on to that and

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,220
ride that wave into you know getting to

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,960
modernize some pieces of your

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,420
infrastructure or bringing up pieces of

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,039
the cyber security agenda that have

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,930
never really been addressed before you

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,910
know what have you been trying to get

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,309
HSMs into the infrastructure for a long

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,430
time here's your opportunity you know so

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,660
I think and if you're someone who's not

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,340
on the technology side of this

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,719
necessarily but it's more on the

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,420
business side of running one of these

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,520
programs for an organization I would say

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,739
it's you don't necessarily need to look

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,809
for subject matter experts external to

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,190
your own org right like you don't have

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,890
to go out and find a thought leader

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,170
who's writing a blog about blockchain

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,250
like go down to the basement where you

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,590
keep the cyber people and ask them how

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,820
how this stuff works because guaranteed

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,489
you have people that already actually

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,290
understand what you could be doing and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,140
who would provide a great dose of truth

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,090
to some of the the use cases that you're

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,830
working on so similarly in the public

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,049
space blockchain has brought renewed

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,570
interests and lots and lots of money

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,060
over the last year into areas of

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,280
research which were for the last decade

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,530
or three considered pretty Miche and

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,530
that's been awesome if you work in an

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,500
empty spaces so for example distributed

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,229
systems computing so again distributed

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,829
databases have existed for a 30 or so

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,350
years but it's easy to say don't use a

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,110
blockchain just to use a database but

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,640
really if we look at how distributed

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,950
databases have worked over the last

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,079
three decades first of all they're not

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,939
widely deployed within enterprises

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,710
certainly not at the scale that people

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,570
seem to think that they are second of

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,869
all they kind of lose stuff sometimes

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,180
and in order to address those challenges

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,490
people have been working on making

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,960
consensus mechanisms more robust making

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,280
them support higher throughput or

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,259
figuring out how you challenge

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,080
coordination how you do leader election

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,610
you know how do you how do you

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,980
handle malicious actors with an

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,320
assistant perhaps and all of that stuff

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,660
collectively together is the same kind

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,520
of research that's underpinning what's

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,360
happening in in both public blockchains

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,920
and enterprise distributed Ledger's so

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,110
sure if you use something already like

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,450
zookeeper or like at CD you know it

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,250
they're very useful but what if you were

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,720
able to also have a decentralized

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,280
version of that what would a

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,380
decentralized version mean it would mean

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,910
that perhaps you could change the trust

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,810
model of the participants in that

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:48,260
Network right or for systems where you

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,180
have extremely high needs for for

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,550
understanding the ordering consistency

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,740
across space and time of a distributed

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,850
system it gets really complicated and

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,070
that's another thing that public block

00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,750
chains are solving for right so again

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,490
it's a spectrum of what your needs

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,930
actually look like but you can start

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,090
playing around with some of the pieces

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,260
here and and actually create some really

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,340
useful interesting things so I guess we

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,900
can explain quickly what these things

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,340
are but Byzantine fault tolerance is the

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,370
ability of your network to tolerate

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,320
malicious actors from inside the network

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,269
so the classical example is you have a

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,620
commander who issues an attack command

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,630
and then you have two different

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,100
lieutenants who hear the message how are

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:26,390
you supposed to ensure that as this

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,560
message is communicated around the

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,930
network that they're getting the

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,060
accurate information right so fault

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,980
tolerance across these networks not just

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,570
in a standard leader election mode but

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,310
there's research into all different

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,019
kinds of consensus mechanisms now right

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,459
whether you're talking proof of stake or

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,350
directed acyclic graphs

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,519
there's just crazy amounts of things

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,440
coming out that never would have

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,989
happened if we didn't have hundreds of

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,180
millions if not billions of dollars kind

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:55,280
of dumped into this sector in the last

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,540
three years and blockchain people love

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,940
their trade-off triangles so here's

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,920
another one so there's a trade-off

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,390
traditionally between systems that are

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,370
going to be open and accessible so

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,570
something where anyone can spin up a

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,730
node and connect to it and a public

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,890
network systems that offer some sort of

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,750
privacy so having things that are

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,040
confidential and secure if you look at

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,510
say that the Bitcoin ledger it's

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,459
entirely transparent even though it's

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,410
pseudonymous and systems that are

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,489
flexible resilient and performant so

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,470
there's kind of like a security

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,419
scalability accessibility kind of

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,790
trade-off that's happening here and so

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,830
far we talked a little

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,800
about the distributed system side which

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,980
is really the ability to mess with this

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,630
side so things how open and trustless

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,700
you can make something I'm trust

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,160
minimized let's call it and how flexible

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,320
resilient and performant they are but

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,850
also there's been so much work happening

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,420
on the confidential and secure side and

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,370
this stuff is really fun so zero

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,710
knowledge proof for example something

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:54,010
that has kind of wild away and in the

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,410
the academic niche audience for the last

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,930
15 years and all of a sudden is out

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,150
there powering some really interesting

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,590
projects for example Z cash full

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,670
disclosure I am on there a Foundation

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,680
Board but that's a nonprofit entity so

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,210
ZK snarks are zero knowledge succinct

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,820
non interactive arguments of knowledge

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,860
right what does that mean who cares it

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,840
allows you to verify the correctness of

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,530
statements without actually knowing what

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,240
the inputs to computations are or having

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,250
to execute them yourselves so a

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,720
real-life example of this could be let's

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,660
say you get like three people together

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,980
and you want to figure out or they want

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,380
to figure out amongst the three of them

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,730
who has the highest salary but none of

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,610
them actually want to disclose their

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,720
salary in the current world what you'd

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,400
probably have to do is get a fourth

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,840
person who serves as that trusted

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,610
intermediary they all report their

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,010
salaries honestly to that person and

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,510
that person figures out you know execute

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,850
the algorithm and then lets all three of

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,980
them know so zero knowledge proof allow

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,430
you to do the same thing but without

00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,660
having that central trusted intermediary

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,040
snarks our specific type of zero

00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,900
knowledge proof that allow you to

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,310
essentially make an access station about

00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,100
anything you can represent as a

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,290
polynomial it gets very mouthy but if

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,150
you're interested the Z cache project is

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,700
doing a lot of really interesting work

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,320
there they've completely come up with

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,030
with new BLS curves around this and

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,680
everything they've got an upgrade coming

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,840
out in the next i think week or two

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,280
that's bringing down the time that it

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,190
would take to generate a zero knowledge

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,100
proof in their system from 40 seconds to

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,470
about seven seconds so just core

00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,390
fundamental cryptographic research is is

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,520
advancing because of this and that's

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:36,160
awesome and fun and not to only shill z

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,120
cache to you there's also bulletproof

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,979
s-- is another area of research

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,479
and some of the library's for bullet

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,160
proofs there's a rust implementation

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,460
that's available as a standalone library

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,840
that you can download and so it doesn't

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,320
have to be again related to

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,900
cryptocurrency but in this case they're

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,790
specifically making attestations about

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,460
range proofs so you could say for

00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,990
example I want to get a car lease and I

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,630
need to prove to you that my income is

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,910
over X amount but not you know under

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,370
infinity like you can make statements

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,630
like that and it also they've done some

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,760
interesting thing with things with

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,789
circuits where you can reduce large

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,419
problem sets to just two small circuits

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,560
to execute here anyway so cool new stuff

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,610
feel free to ask me more questions later

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,080
if you want to want to make sure we have

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,919
enough time or I'll ramble all day on

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,570
these secure multi-party computation so

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,130
oh here's the styler highest example

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,440
that I had put up here so again you

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,380
would want to use something where you

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,870
can without having that that third party

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,310
that's there so Shamir secret sharing

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,440
traditionally allows you to break up

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,300
pieces of a secret distribute it to

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,220
multiple people you need M of n of them

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,690
to come together in order to reconstruct

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,340
a secret so the reason that

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,229
cryptocurrency people are super excited

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,099
about this is it could potentially be a

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:51,110
solution to that

00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,030
oops I lost my private key thing right

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,979
so instead if you could break up a

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,930
secret and perhaps have other people

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,300
with your consent we could reconstruct

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,340
your key then all of a sudden it's not

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,139
so terrible if you're the the only

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,050
custodian or the only person that holds

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,880
your key in working in an institutional

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,770
banking setting it's similarly important

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,800
because there are legal requirements to

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,990
have custodians hold your money and it's

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,570
not really clear for crypto assets what

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,400
custodianship means there's a whole

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,260
thing around having things online and

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,760
hot wallets versus offline and cold

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,590
wallets but that's not necessarily

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,570
enough and when you get people that want

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,789
to say I have my money I am my own bank

00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,470
I have access to it at any time but also

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,229
your custodian really is the one who

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,209
holds it it can get complicated with the

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,520
legal arrangement that looks like and so

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:39,409
when you start using various types of

00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,229
secret sharing you can create more

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,390
complex custody arrangements and then

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,560
finally ashen or signatures bitcoin

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,420
recently added these as well as a way to

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,900
reduce the number of signatures or

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,580
compress

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,410
kind of the number of signatures they're

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,100
required to do something at a multiparty

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,960
way so any of that stuff is interesting

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,350
should I read the cartoon can you read

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,120
from back there so I don't know if

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,730
anybody's seen the xkcd or it's like the

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,280
crypto nerds imagination of like oh no

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,720
this laptop is encrypted with like you

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,340
know create crazy encryption we're never

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,620
gonna be able to get at it like quick

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,150
spin up you know spin up a huge Network

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,320
and then the other side is like what

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,790
actually happens in real life it's just

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,710
a person with a wrench that's like hit

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,080
him in the head and ask for his private

00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,300
key so threat models threat models are

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,920
important so this one says his etherium

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,350
hardware wallet has an eight digit pin

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,210
shoot our caper is foiled but what

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,800
really would happen is oh he has a

00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,030
hardware wallet well let's check his

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,080
sock drawer to see if he has a recovery

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:41,180
of phrase bingo so right now the

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,700
operational security model of most

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,290
people that are involving themselves

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,540
with cryptocurrency is not quite as

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,520
robust as it needs to be and going

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,260
forward we need to get from the

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,340
passwords on a post it next to your

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,560
monitor to LastPass kind of or one

00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,730
password kind of equivalent or a lot of

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,750
people are going to be losing a lot of

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,100
money right so usability is where we

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,840
need to go it's all fun it's all like

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,630
fun and games to talk about like yay

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,870
brand-new crypto research crypto meaning

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,480
cryptography but if you if we can't make

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,610
this stuff useable to people in the real

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,500
world then it's it's not necessarily

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,660
that helpful I'll say that multiple

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,670
times until people remember okay and

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,860
then finally another really fun thing

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,470
analysis resistant networking so

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,580
projects like tor projects like ITP have

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,480
been around for some time

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:34,940
other mix net research still continue to

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,500
be seen as the realm of people that need

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,340
to hide something from somebody because

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,200
they're doing something wrong also you

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,170
know dissident journalists there's the

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,790
entire kind of the challenge here being

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,000
that your threat model is again changing

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:51,890
too how are we going to handle passive

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,070
resistance to a global passive adversary

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,310
it gets like super crazy and in that

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,830
space and it's been awesome to see so

00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,990
much more research going into how to

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,730
maintain privacy at the networking layer

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,170
so previously I

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,269
talking about privacy at the protocol

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,519
layers with bulletproof sand the CK

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,260
snark stuff so this would be more at the

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,680
networking layer where we're trying to

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,810
obscure where stuff is going and the

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,769
actual kind of routing of packets and

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,120
messages within the networks and so tour

00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,070
also you can consider to be more

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,990
centralized with its broadcast list of

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,910
peers and things so we're trying to kind

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,320
of get around that and dandelion is a

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:35,630
new project that aims to do that and

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,519
it's it's there's some good talks I

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,630
tried to put one at least one link on

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,250
each of these things if you want to go

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,230
learn more but they've done some really

00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,630
interesting kind of mathematical proving

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,380
around how to create the most efficient

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,820
and most anonymity adding kind of

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,980
routing and it turns out that they came

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,290
up with this stem and fluff kind of idea

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,560
so it looks like a dandelion so messages

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:00,410
pass through a specific kind of order

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,660
and then they are broadcast globally and

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,100
it's it's neat stuff so this is

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,769
something that completely didn't exist

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,730
you know a year ago honestly it's that

00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:12,470
new okay so where are we going with this

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,949
well we're creating an internet of value

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:18,529
right

00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:22,430
yay programmable money we solved

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:25,040
everything right okay so what the heck

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,569
are these things I don't know does

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,610
anybody know the difference between do

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:30,620
web and the decentralized web or web 3.0

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,019
and web 3 because like all of these have

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,250
conferences like there's different

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,440
conferences for all of these things

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,670
right so I sat down and I tried to

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,310
literally figure out what the difference

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,810
between all of these were and I have a I

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,370
gave another talk a little while ago

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,110
that hopefully will be online soon with

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,790
some fun analysis of internet search

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,230
trends and things about them but the

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,300
point is like nobody knows what any of

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,690
these things are unless you are old

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,490
enough to remember actual web 3.0 does

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,920
anyone remember the Semantic Web who

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,139
remembers the Semantic Web yeah well

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,170
we're all using that now right totally

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:06,709
worked out because take back your data

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,839
ok so wired in 2010 called the Semantic

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,209
Web a fully distributed web-based system

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,980
for publishing logical assertions well

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,959
that's amazing cuz it's exactly the same

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,250
words that we use now to describe this

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,200
kind of decentralized web kind of

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,980
smart contract blockchain thing that

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,620
we're all building that's web 3 so if it

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,450
didn't work in 2010 why is it going to

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,500
work now

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:33,270
obviously the answer is money we have

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,440
tokens now but it's not just economics

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,840
there's identity and there's a lot of

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,530
other challenges that underlie these

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:45,150
systems so why doesn't web 3.1 first of

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:47,790
all that's a machine learning thank you

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,290
so first of all it turns out that

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,930
getting everyone in the world to agree

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,240
on a single ontology of data globally

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,920
and then markup everything that has ever

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,020
been put on the web so that it conforms

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,740
to these kinds of standards like ain't

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,990
gonna happen

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,490
right and it was turned out it was a lot

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,110
easier especially because those things

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,990
are game above for SEO and other other

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,650
things that the map is not the territory

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,790
parsing the underlying data and grabbing

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:13,050
context out of the actual words that are

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,390
there turned out to be much more

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,860
accurate and so people stopped tagging

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,930
things up because we could just let the

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,580
robots do it and then who did a really

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,730
good job of building the robots and who

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,900
has the data now right this is not those

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:31,980
those are business models thank you here

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,780
I'll be here all week so it turns out

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,839
that money matters as well and as much

00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,160
as we wanted RSS and XMPP and open

00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,050
standards and adversarial

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,740
interoperability to continue to be a

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,050
thing people wanted the usability of

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,880
these walled garden experiences and we

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,350
kind of let it happen and even though

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,370
there were a lot of people screaming the

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,050
same people who are screaming net

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,760
neutrality and other things there is a

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,589
dedicated core of people that care about

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,740
these things but it's never been enough

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,000
to kind of shift the tide there and so

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,589
hopefully we're at this point where

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,930
there are these new things that are

00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,240
coming out there are advances in tools

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,800
open tools for machine learning there

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,330
are these cryptographic advances that

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,260
allow you to thread the needle between

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,670
privacy and sharing and to do selective

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,400
disclosure and to do zero-knowledge

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,900
attestation and again the kind of

00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,210
hardware level security and things that

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,100
we didn't have before and there's also

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,540
peer to peer micro payments certainly

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,220
should not be underestimated so

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,320
somewhere in there we can possibly

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,060
create these kinds of micro economies

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,810
but we need the tools to be able to

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,630
manage them

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,370
that regular normal humans can have

00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,320
without needing to quit their job to

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,470
become data arbitrage errs during the

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,000
day as a career choice oh the Weber next

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,830
so I didn't know the difference between

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,870
I'm going to do this I didn't know the

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,740
difference to in web 3 and decentralized

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,110
web and all these things I couldn't

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,070
figure it out so I made up my own word

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,740
okay so it's the Weber next so obviously

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,470
we're on the webbernet now so this would

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,260
be the Weber next that's what's coming

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,470
and what I did is I tried to kind of

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,240
rationalize the the things that sounded

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,100
good about all of these different

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,860
projects because they don't really agree

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,050
on a lot of things if you're trying to

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,029
build something on polkadot Network

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,830
versus trying to build something on like

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,930
a fabric Network versus all these other

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,370
kind of decentralized that or any kind

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,070
of projects they do not use the same

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,020
language so what would actually be a

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,820
useful system well hopefully something

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,010
where data beacon can be kept closer to

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,350
its point of origin where we are moving

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,360
to more of a least authority model for

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,860
trust management where you have low

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,930
level protocols that are censorship

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,130
resistant but platforms and applications

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:43,890
might not be where you have data and

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,710
identity that allow more consent and opt

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,020
in from the users but where you can also

00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:52,110
possibly offload that kind of consent to

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,660
someone that you do trust and where we

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,990
can ideally revisit this kind of

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,850
adversarial interoperability place but

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,240
which is also known as just open web

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,040
standards but in order to revisit that

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,449
we can't start there by saying that's

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,550
what we want to get to we need to solve

00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,230
the business challenges first block

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,550
chains were helpful not where where they

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,290
were they're not helpful and a user

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,790
experience that rivals the current web

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,650
all of that would be awesome

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,980
do I think it's necessarily attainable

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:23,699
and achievable I'm not sure but I think

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,760
this is an interesting kind of map to

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,590
keep closed when we evaluate are we

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,480
achieving our goals here or are we just

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,820
trying to deploy another blockchain are

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,170
we trying to give consent to people are

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,090
we trying to help people challenge

00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,010
hegemony of existing incumbents or are

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,120
we trying to like maximize some coin

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:44,429
value important questions and this is

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,760
how I think of it so that I had posted

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,060
this

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,650
on Twitter already if you want it but so

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,850
there is actual like architectural

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,070
thinking under this that it's different

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,560
about how you can map peer-to-peer and

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:58,410
decentralized types of applications to

00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,940
them so different projects can map to

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,250
this it's not just for blockchain

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,260
projects it's for projects that simply

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,820
are not based on a centralized server

00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,320
architecture and then if you're

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,060
interested so this is what clover does

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,700
in the green box we're working with a

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,560
bunch of types of block chains and other

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,820
peer-to-peer protocols and it's a

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,470
completely open-source extensible

00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,270
framework so hopefully someone will

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,050
build tor integration but I'm not doing

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,270
that right now anyway so I think that we

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,520
are only doomed to repeat history if we

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,200
don't learn for it right so this time

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,240
around if we're gonna do all of this

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,010
stuff again and we're gonna say take

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,840
back your data the cyberpunk dream is

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,760
not dead this time we need to

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,030
acknowledge that the business models

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,550
matter that developer experience matters

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,950
that end user experiences matter and

00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,230
that politics matter politics at the

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,940
geopolitical level matter at the like at

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,790
that literally the nation state level

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,290
matter you know there are there are

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,340
crypto asset projects you know the three

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,080
countries that have created their own

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,760
crypto currencies that are state backed

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,620
projects right now are China Russia and

00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,080
Venezuela and it's it's like not a

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,090
coincidence you know so if you recall

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,220
the Splinter net kind of crypto Wars of

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,170
the 90s all of that stuff that the

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,060
that's old is new again and we're

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:13,100
encountering the same exact types of

00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:15,300
challenges there's there's funding for

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,460
specific protocols that use different

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,140
cryptographic suites that are have

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,540
nothing to do with NIST I mean all of

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,010
this stuff is it's it's fascinating if

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,110
you'd like to deep dive into that also

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,020
if you are a corporate cybersecurity

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,790
person if you can work to try to get

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,560
non-standard cryptographic suites

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,180
approved that would be one thing that

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,310
would really help people that are trying

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,990
to innovate right because if you want to

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,780
use something like play around with zero

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,910
knowledge attestations or use something

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,920
that uses like the bernstein curves and

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,350
things like the this this is not part of

00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,150
your standard corporate Suites and a lot

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,270
of times innovation projects like they

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:54,240
kind of die so that's my my plea to you

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,980
please help and so also the politics of

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:02,179
their open-source communities matter

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:06,030
so what have we learned from this

00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:08,340
emergent open source community

00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,809
decentralized governance experiments of

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,970
blockchain land that's happening right

00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:13,530
now what have we learned so far and what

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,740
do I kind of think that we have yet to

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:20,400
learn out there and some of these these

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,040
challenges are not specific just to to

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,570
blockchain projects some of them I think

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,549
are endemic to just open source in

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,470
general like this is again that kind of

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,790
trade-off for different priorities that

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,010
you have in open source communities

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,840
usually there's there's some people who

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,740
want to draw head for engagement and

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,260
they think that engagement is very

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,330
important there's some people who are

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,440
prioritizing the the freedom of

00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,720
contributions and some people who are

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,120
kind of advocating for community and us

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,460
all coming together I I grab this

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,350
content from there's a YouTube talk

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,080
called the hard parts of open source

00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,400
that Evan I'm gonna butcher his NASA

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,040
name last name but I think it's too

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,200
flicky had said it is a great talk it's

00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,200
I highly recommend taking some time to

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,669
watch that one but that different people

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,090
kind of fall in different places on the

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:08,610
spectrum and driving engagement often

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,290
comes at the expense of community a lot

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,700
of times community managers and open

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,130
source and stuff we keep saying we have

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,450
to drive engagement but people are most

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,470
engaged when they're yelling at each

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,440
other and you know you can the way to

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,549
get people most riled up and to tweet

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,500
the most about your project just like

00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,840
really piss them off or you know it's

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,220
what's the old adage about the best way

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,660
to get a right answer on the Internet is

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,280
to offer a wrong answer first so what do

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,419
you want to have people who all think

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,210
the same thing and are moving in

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,860
lockstep how much you trying to foster

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,230
discussion about other kinds of ways of

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,260
doing things forward and how much do we

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,419
want centralized control versus kind of

00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,220
the community writ large decides what

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,510
we're doing next I mean it sounds great

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,350
in theory but like design by committee

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,820
generally doesn't work that great so

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,890
figuring out again where your project

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,700
kind of falls within that community or

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:07,070
within that that spectrum it can really

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,309
impact how your community is seen large

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,919
globally and then this is also

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:15,100
which is the idea of implementing again

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,320
as a UX thing like in your forums the

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,970
idea of structured conversations so when

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,039
you want to make a post if you actually

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,549
click I would like to learn something

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,529
right now

00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,330
so you've broadcast to people I am

00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:28,419
trying to learn right now as opposed to

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,850
you know I am trying to just make a

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:32,620
random opinion or express myself so I'm

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,850
trying to learn and someone who's trying

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,340
to answer you can ask for a

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,840
clarification or can attempt to answer

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,299
and when they attempt to answer they

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,700
first need to restate your question this

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:44,710
is a specifically enforced usability

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,919
workflow that tries to de-escalate

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,539
problems through interface design that's

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,659
kind of interesting you get you get a

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,059
lot more kind of human interaction and a

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:57,990
lot kinder communities but it takes work

00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:00,450
and it's not best for all projects so

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:05,080
other lessons we have yet to learn

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:07,419
that's like my favorite gift I love that

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,999
one okay so since I know there's a lot

00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,029
of enterprise open-source folks here and

00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:17,019
having run in a corporate open source

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:19,330
project myself people will ask or or

00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:22,299
wonder why is my fancy open source

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,269
project failing I've I've put it on the

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:26,830
github it's there and yet the people the

00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:28,749
people have not come that people are not

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,990
contributing we need to drive more

00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:36,309
engagement set up a meet-up like we need

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,929
more stickers and that's not really

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,460
where engagement comes from right people

00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,200
contribute to open source projects

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,779
because it kind of almost solved a

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,549
problem that they have right now they

00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:47,740
needed to augment or change something

00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,179
specific in order to make that work and

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,429
then they would like to give that

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,960
addition back you know they didn't come

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,940
in and say like well let me look at the

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,559
project roadmap that's here that they

00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,570
have published and figure out like you

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,340
know I I have four hours free right now

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,509
I'd like to like punch my timecard

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,519
that's how employed labor works and so

00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,809
we see a lack of engagement in a lot of

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,509
these these corporate open source

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:15,700
projects because people are seen as more

00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:17,830
free labor than than humans right and I

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,629
think in the the blockchain and open

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,029
source a space it's a little different

00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:22,750
because economics are so conflated with

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,940
the work

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,770
there and there's people do have this

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,480
idea that they're they're going to get a

00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,190
payout soon so there is more

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,660
quote-unquote free work or you're

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,400
economically invested in that you've

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,970
bought the coin and now you're doing the

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,670
work but still still there is just so

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,350
few qualified people that the co

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,180
contributions across these projects is

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,770
still what I would consider highly

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,060
centralized I'm working on some

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,190
statistics around that'll be out in a

00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,510
couple weeks but it's interesting stuff

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,030
people are gonna get super mad on

00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:53,830
Twitter I'm really excited okay

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,100
but there are some lessons that I think

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,530
that we have learned so design by

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,500
committee is heart designed by minor

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,810
voting and and all of the kind of

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,820
decentralized signaling and all this

00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,920
other stuff that you find within in

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,440
public blockchain networks is especially

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,000
hard it's it's it's really cool and

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,010
there's gonna be a lot of masters theses

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,230
written on it but it's a very hard way

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,930
to progress forward and it does make

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,850
change necessarily slow that's not

00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,110
always a bad thing especially when you

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,090
look at the resilience and the

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:29,350
relatively low rate of catastrophic

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,700
failure within these projects economic

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,340
incentives create complex

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,380
socio-political factions which is like a

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,890
hard way of saying like Mo Money mo

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,990
problems I guess but you know once you

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,090
have instituted economics and these

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,190
systems like people really care it's no

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,110
longer just like how should we sign this

00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,000
integer it's like oh my god you're

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,050
messing with my livelihood and people

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,400
get really heated really really quickly

00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:57,520
you can't really overestimate developer

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,000
loyalty so although we have felt like we

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,070
have this community when there's a new

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,810
project a new project raises X hundreds

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,010
of millions of dollars and then launches

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:10,690
its own VC fund to build new tools

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:12,640
developers kind of might go where the

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,710
money is and some of them do and some of

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,360
them don't but it turns out that the

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,340
network effects especially this early

00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,770
within these communities are not nearly

00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:24,220
as sticky as we kind of thought that

00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,870
they were going to be and I think

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,440
front-loading diversity inclusion have

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:32,230
paid off in that space it was like very

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,450
vocal very early on what people wanted

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,020
the inclusivity story to be for these

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,090
kind

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,200
developer projects and sure a lot of

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:40,840
that is because people thought like

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,420
bitcoin is hostile to women etc etc but

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,210
I've seen that because they put so much

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:48,220
work in an upfront the community is

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,210
changing very rapidly and there are a

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,180
lot of a lot of people that are

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,830
attracted to to these projects and

00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,420
because of that I think it's it's just

00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,150
worth saying you know I know sometimes

00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,860
it feels nebulous and if you're sqlite

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,570
you know and you just want to throw a

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,640
code of conduct in there just to jab at

00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,800
your community you know like maybe think

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,720
twice because that's not what kind of

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,600
community do you want to create here um

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,390
and finally it is indeed possible to

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,770
successfully fork a project so some

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,120
people when they do get pissed off do

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,950
you take their ball and go home and

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,690
that's okay because sometimes that

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:24,310
results in another almost equally

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:25,720
successful project and then finally to

00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,450
close here and I'm happy to take some

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,680
questions and have some discussion you

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,750
know I just think it's worth saying that

00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,750
technology does not obviate our

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,300
responsibility for system design none of

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:41,050
these things that I talked about are

00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,490
going to take away our the the ethical

00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,050
sorts of choices that we make when

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,910
designing these systems and the

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,300
trade-offs that we have to make between

00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:51,970
giving people fundamental privacy versus

00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,820
the ability to do enforcement of what we

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:58,690
consider you know act actions against

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,400
bad actors so it's the same trade-off

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,290
anonymity and abuse etcetera I pulled

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,180
this from Alex Stamos had tweeted this a

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,110
little while ago he's the former CEO at

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:10,000
Facebook and these are ongoing

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,830
conversations this is about the types of

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,900
systems that you want to create and I

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,970
think it's it's important to have more

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,610
vocal conversations about these

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,520
trade-offs but no single choice

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:24,550
technology is neutral kind of regardless

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,380
I disagree with that statement but this

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,410
technology allows us to implement these

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,910
things that that we have thought through

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,710
and sometimes the things that we think

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,020
you have unintended consequences when

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,180
they reach scale but we can't really

00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,650
expect some brand new thing to come in

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,530
and solve quote-unquote you know

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,900
blockchain is magic it's not it's up to

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,340
us to make these things do what we'd

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,140
like them to do

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,140
so thank you

00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:58,710
um it looks like I have like six minutes

00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:00,389
for chit chat if anybody would like to

00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,700
ask a question or yell at me about

00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:04,860
anything in specific yeah go ahead

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,169
I don't know do we have mics for

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,169
questions or are we just shouting okay

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:18,299
do I have what Strato so wait substrate

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:21,450
or substratum I know substrate and I

00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:24,710
know Strato I don't know substratum okay

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,710
you can tell me about it later

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,030
sure we can we can chat about specific

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,289
projects after yeah because I need to

00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,600
know more about it than censorship

00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,659
resistant so let's come find me yeah go

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,659
ahead

00:29:48,140 --> 00:30:00,299
she said that's a lot of information

00:29:50,130 --> 00:30:02,640
thank you well how do you start learning

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,260
about these things I mean I tried to

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,240
include like getting up to speed links

00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,490
on some of the specific projects I was

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,539
talking about but in general it's a mix

00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,039
I mean it depends what kind of

00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:17,460
organization you want and what outcome

00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:20,309
you want out of it it's okay to start

00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,140
with white papers I mean more like the

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,510
consulting white papers than the crypto

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,270
white papers but pretty soon you should

00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,100
look at like blog the blog posts from

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,720
some of the leaders in the space that

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,750
are writing stuff I think crypto Twitter

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,130
is actually really good and I should

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,419
probably have like a list of references

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,640
that's a hard question to ask because I

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,049
don't want to slight anybody there's

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,250
also a few podcasts that are good if

00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:44,190
you're interested more in enterprise

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,809
stuff eleven FS does one that's called

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,760
blockchain insider if you want more

00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,460
public stuff flourish in done does one

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,620
called unconfirmed

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,980
those are Unchained there's two she does

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,240
too

00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,240
but yeah good

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,450
correct

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,350
privacy side a little bit better

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:25,980
yeah I definitely think that the privacy

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,630
outlook for Bitcoin is getting better

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,070
because there's been so much screaming

00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,570
about it over the last couple of years

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,429
I'm gonna I'm not gonna make any

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,620
specific statements about lightning

00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:37,260
because that's a hotly contested impact

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,880
of privacy based on lightning thing but

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,049
yeah I mean even just like the dandelion

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,230
thing that you're looking at like you

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,150
could implement that on top of Bitcoin

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,400
and it would be helpful there's a lot of

00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,770
things that you can do Manero just

00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,049
adding like ITP support with their like

00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,630
overi stuff I think was really good

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:56,580
so yeah the like it shouldn't

00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,110
necessarily be about like put on your

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,330
team shirt like we're not playing sports

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,559
here so it's not I mean I guess if you

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,880
own a bunch of one coin you're

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,030
incentivized to have that be the only

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,010
thing that wins but you know I think Z

00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,570
cash is doing really fantastic work but

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,910
there are other projects that are taking

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,370
that work and also running with it and

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,320
even across the the members of the

00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,059
developer like all these developers kind

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,440
of know each other right like the people

00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,020
that have been on early zero knowledge

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,450
publication papers are working in like

00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,660
multiple different projects now so I

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:30,049
think yes the outlet but the outlook of

00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,520
privacy for Bitcoin I hope is good and

00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:35,429
that it's spurring more and more

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,740
research into other other projects I

00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:39,929
hope no coins are launched in like a

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,820
year that aren't quote-unquote privacy

00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:49,610
coins because everything should be a

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,610
privacy corn yeah yeah

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:32,540
against any concepts

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,919
yeah

00:33:51,870 --> 00:34:00,730
mm-hmm yeah it is no I mean literally I

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:04,000
haven't seen kind of the the concepts

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,770
underlying this the technology

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,270
quote-unquote presented that's literally

00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,620
why I wanted to break it out this way

00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:10,240
because it's presented as this

00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,310
monolithic like blockchain thing to

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,140
people and honestly I think it's bananas

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:17,650
that this room is the same size as the

00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,360
dev ops room like that's ridiculous but

00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,130
people are super excited to learn more

00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,440
about this technology and we can either

00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,540
sit them down and say like here's a use

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,370
case and to end where we're gonna solve

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,300
derivative settlement or here's a use

00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:30,370
case we're going to put all your

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:34,180
healthcare data on a blockchain it's

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,800
like terrifying or you can say like you

00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,450
know zero knowledge at a station could

00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,160
be incredibly useful for a number of

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,270
projects and could be implemented in a

00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,040
centralized setting and a not a

00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,500
centralized setting so I hope that yeah

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,600
we do see more of that where you break

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,100
out the pieces and then people put them

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,020
together in new ways that's what it's

00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,490
supposed to be about that's why I kind

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,820
of that architecture diagram that I have

00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,710
is a really fun thought exercise you can

00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,120
take something like BitTorrent and like

00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,710
map it onto that and like that's solving

00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
a real-world problem maybe not one that

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,070
people wish existed like that's the

00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,260
problem and then if you think about you

00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,300
know why why did BitTorrent rise and

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,850
then why did bit Victorian kind of

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,920
traffic collapse as Netflix came out

00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,080
it's not cuz the technology changed it's

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,060
because business models changed right so

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,600
to allow us to confront this interplay

00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,100
between the technical components and the

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,110
business models that are just so

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,550
transparent I mean bug bounties and

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,650
cryptocurrency systems are like a

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,580
literally quantified like go get the

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,040
money and that's how much it's worth

00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:33,100
like an exploit isn't that much and

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,070
that's awesome so I hope to see more

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,140
more talks that are about that kind of

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,320
cool stuff and less about how we all get

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,850
rich I guess I think that's all I have

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,400
time for but if you want to corner me

00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:47,969
over there I'll be there thank you

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,969
