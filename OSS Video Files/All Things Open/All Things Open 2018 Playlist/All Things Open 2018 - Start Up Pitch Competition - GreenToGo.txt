hi everyone I'm crystal Dreisbach from

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,139
green to go technologies and today I'm

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,230
going to tell you how we're gonna solve

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,710
problems for consumers the environment

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,650
and businesses bringing I open source

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,650
and IOT innovation to the waste economy

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,150
so first here's a little about my team

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,460
I'm a former public health researcher

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,860
and I have 15 years experience in

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,649
executive leadership and it's starting

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,079
companies my business partner derek has

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,090
ten years experience starting companies

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
and leading technology teams and we've

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,760
got this amazing team of solution Ares

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,489
who help power the software hardware and

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,059
business side of our operations and

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,890
here's a little bit about our traction

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,230
so for the past 15 months we've been

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,930
operating a reusable takeout container

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,960
service in Durham restaurants and this

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,799
proof of concept single-handedly shows

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,630
that a reuse system is possible and that

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,760
consumers and businesses are already

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:19,259
paying for this because it solves a

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:23,729
problem for them and we've learned that

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,400
other cities want this green to go was

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,240
just recently featured on PBS newshour

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,579
and from it we got 220 or more sales

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,009
leads from cities all over the country

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,579
in the world who want this in their own

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,600
City

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,710
they're ready to pay now for a for

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,729
technology that will disrupt their

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,939
struggling waste economy so we decided

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,729
we're going to open source our all of

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,270
our knowledge and everything that we've

00:01:52,729 --> 00:02:01,020
experienced so far we'll be sharing our

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,770
data our toolkits and our lessons

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,990
learned in the form of a webinar series

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,800
and a learning portal that will have a

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,690
toolkit and a peer sharing forum and

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,420
virtual office hours these communities

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,209
want

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,610
learn how to do this and we're going to

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,150
show them how in a way that allows them

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,940
to adopt a really cool technology to be

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,260
relevant and fit and adapt to their own

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:31,720
community so the demand for this comes

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,550
from customer segments for which we can

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,709
solve the biggest problems and some of

00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:40,330
these are sports stadiums corporate

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:42,970
cafes and city governments our beta test

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,769
in Durham has identified three main pain

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,739
points that can be solved with IOT

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,769
technology by creating a tech package

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,959
that's going to make our own program

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,080
easier and better we're also making

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,600
reuse systems easier and more scalable

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,330
for cities and venues so what is our

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,069
product our customers are gonna buy a

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,100
technology package that includes

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:08,560
hardware and software as a service this

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,260
is the RFID enabled food and beverage

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,049
vessels return receptacles and check out

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,900
hardware with RFID sensors and then the

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:21,640
customizable dashboard that is powered

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:24,370
by our open source software our open

00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,859
source dashboard is customizable

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,890
Deut up to the specific needs of each

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:32,890
customer for example we talked to a

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,980
large corporation called SAS in our in

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,840
our nearby Research Triangle Park from

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,680
their own reusable takeout container

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,239
service their program they validate all

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,950
the same pain points that we've

00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,810
identified and one of these is meeting

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,209
technology to link container checkouts

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,640
to employ so they can track who has

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,549
these containers and our software is

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,859
able to leverage Sasa's existing

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,060
employee badges to provide this data to

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:06,549
SAS and provide this value to them

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,989
meanwhile POS integration is a really

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,019
important part when you want to do

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,290
large-scale implementation to sports

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,730
stadiums and grocery store chains and

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,729
finally we have learned that our

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,039
customers want data and analytics that

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:24,430
are specific to what's important to them

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,990
from operational data to customer

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,240
behavior analytics and

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,849
trends within their own industry so one

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,289
particular restaurant for example wants

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,210
to know when they'll receive their next

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:36,370
delivery of containers the ability to

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,380
order more and then the customer

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,389
behavior analytics give them the

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,680
marketing opportunities they need to

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:47,050
sell more to convert those and maximize

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,690
their conversion rates so these are

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,210
features that are customisable to them

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,289
and they add even more value to what

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,240
they're already paying for so over the

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,729
last six months we've been learning how

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,389
we can scale green to go from our little

00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:07,210
town to closed-loop systems like sports

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:09,909
stadiums corporate cafeterias and event

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,030
venues maybe even conferences all things

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:15,509
open is an open source convention maybe

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,250
needs an open source container solution

00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:21,460
we're also the ones that are gonna bring

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,880
open source and IOT to the waste economy

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,449
on an even larger scale green to go is a

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,280
smart utility for any smart city

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,409
disrupting and improving the waste

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,240
management waste management and

00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:37,449
recycling industries that are really

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,849
struggling right now imagine the day

00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,639
when you can push your reusables to the

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:46,060
curb just like trash and recycling or

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:51,370
maybe instead of the city of Salisbury

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,080
for example has a has bars really

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,180
struggling right now with costs and

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,130
they're diminishing landfill space as

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,130
well so the recycling companies

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,500
available to them to do collection for

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,509
residents is charging them three times

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,699
more to renew their contracts and

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,650
they're bringing this contract to their

00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,960
county manager and the county manager

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,199
says where do you want me to get this

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,940
money from public schools or police so

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,009
they have a real cost problem on their

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,250
hand and green to go could relieve the

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:23,139
burden of disposable food packaging on

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,300
their waste management system and

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,639
they've actually approached us to

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,190
potentially pilot this on a municipal

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:35,860
scale so what's next our team is now

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,380
completing the prototype of our new tech

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,750
to prepare it for a January beta test

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:45,340
and we're currently vetting three large

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:47,890
RTP corporations to test this new tech

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,650
in their corporate cafeterias early next

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,050
year I hope that you'll approach me

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,690
after this talk and also you'll come

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,890
visit our table tonight at 5:30 at the

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:02,080
IOT demo night to learn more and I want

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,660
to thank you and here's to a future

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,540
that's more profitable in way less

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:13,330
trashy all right ladies and gentlemen

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,950
give it up for green to go and now we'll

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,820
have about five minutes of Q&A time from

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:24,430
our panel of judges can you talk about

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:28,870
your business model yes so people are

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:32,140
for example closed loop venues like

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,960
stadiums and corporate cafeterias really

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,990
want to buy our product right now

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,270
because they it pays for itself in less

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,350
than a year and saves them loads of

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:47,590
money a really good example of this is a

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,030
stadium we're talking to a few stadiums

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,610
right now they're very interested in

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,860
that's because they're up they're

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,640
perfect for a reuse system they're a

00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,250
place where people eat they order their

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,410
food they eat in place and they return

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,240
with air container they throw away their

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,810
containers before they leave the stadium

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,120
so this is a system that even when you

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:14,890
figure in infrastructure and staffing

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,800
pays for itself in one season so the

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,900
business model is people will visit

00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,700
these businesses especially closed loop

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,620
venues municipalities that are

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,870
interested in this will buy this

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,690
technology package it's a standalone

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,630
package that allows them to customize it

00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,570
to their communities make it relevant to

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,469
them and also to be able to implement

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:43,419
reuse on their own and make it as easy

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:47,590
and automated as throwaway thanks

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,030
crystal and it was good to see the PBS

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,980
I don't know and I guess I won't call it

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,960
marketing but exposure that way

00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:00,070
so the margins are so slim in the food

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,050
industry is your packaging is it less

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,850
expensive than what they do have today

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:09,250
or more but the upfront cost of

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,790
reusables is definitely higher but as we

00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,130
found the expenses they put out

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,710
thousands and thousands of dollars every

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,510
year for disposables that people eat off

00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,970
of for a few minutes and then just throw

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,840
in the trash so if they can make this

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,980
upfront

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,200
reusable durable common-sense

00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,900
alternative a price pending priority

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,550
they're gonna see cost savings and it

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,320
paying for itself very quickly so I

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,880
wonder if you could help us understand a

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,880
little more clearly where your

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,230
innovation is in this I mean obviously

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,880
RFID has been around quite a while and

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,910
aggregating that traffic and

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,310
understanding the behavior of the tagged

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,230
devices has been around so is it in the

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,050
design of the package itself and it's

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:58,270
durability is it cost just help us

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,650
understand a little bit more why you're

00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,360
different and how you're gonna kind of

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,420
distinguish yourselves from anybody else

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,550
that jumps in the market with you so as

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,850
a public health researcher I was for

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,310
many years really upset about single use

00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,740
disposables I thought why are we using

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,780
this stuff it's bad for human beings

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,060
it's bad for the local economy it's bad

00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,540
for the earth so I sat up in bed one

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,640
night in 2009 and thought this is what

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,260
the world needs a reusable takeout

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,820
container service and people thought

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,530
this is too hard

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,420
crystal you'll have to figure out how to

00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,470
get people to return the containers how

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,290
are you gonna pick them up how are you

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:38,140
gonna get them to the restaurants so we

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:41,260
figured out how to do that to prove the

00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,530
concept that we use a reusable service

00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,170
was possible and in doing that so that

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,600
is something that is one innovation we

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,060
can check off the list but in doing that

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,460
we learned there are three main pain

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,240
points to a reuse system that can be

00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,029
resolved with IOT technology and so by

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,570
adding that to what we're currently

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,520
doing and making this technology package

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,290
people can implement reuse systems that

00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,750
they really want we've come to find out

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,560
they really want it they can do it in a

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,209
way in a take advantage of open-source

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,600
adapt it to their needs and do it in

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:25,630
this very automated streamlined scalable

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,110
way I'm trying to understand what you

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,670
open sourced exactly and what convinced

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,470
you that open sourcing would be helpful

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,390
useful to your business sort of why why

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,720
did you choose open-source I guess yes

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:40,420
so part of our mission is to proliferate

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,060
reuse systems everywhere and one way to

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,550
do that if you come up with a great idea

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,000
great solution a great technology is

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,230
obviously to make it accessible and

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,950
adaptable to places so that it's

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:57,040
relevant to their needs so that is one

00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,170
reason that's of course a great one of

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,450
the great advantages to open source and

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,339
we felt that was very important in our

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:07,029
mission to proliferate reuse systems

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:10,209
everywhere the other part is that there

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,670
are as we recently found out communities

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,329
everywhere that want to learn how to do

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,880
what we're doing

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:18,520
so rather than keep this information to

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:23,470
ourselves we want to share it we want to

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,360
in in a business terms cultivate the

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,459
future customers for our tech package

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,700
because in places right now where reuse

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,700
does not exist they're not yet ready to

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,950
buy our tech package but by helping them

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,750
along and open sourcing all of our

00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,589
experience getting them up to speed and

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,060
making this possible in their community

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,579
they'll be they'll be ready to do this

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,880
on their own we think of it a little bit

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:51,550
like WordPress WordPress software by

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,950
itself is free and open and adaptable

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:58,240
and people can make it their own

00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:01,209
but then you have these plugins and our

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,930
technology are the plugins into into

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:08,020
WordPress that make make this real

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,290
system fully customizable for each

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,290
customer

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:19,750
please give it up for green to go

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,750
