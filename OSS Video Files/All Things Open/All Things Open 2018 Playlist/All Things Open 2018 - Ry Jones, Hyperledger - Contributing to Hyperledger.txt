I'm glad to see you all made it up here

00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:12,780
today I want to talk about how you can

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,040
apply your expertise to open source in

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,880
general and hyper ledger

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,249
in specific we need you we need your

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,749
involvement and we need your expertise

00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:28,529
oh I I am Raj Ahn's I'm the community

00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:30,569
architect for hyper ledger I got started

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,640
in the tech industry back in the mid 80s

00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:36,629
and I have worked on delivering products

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,750
for the entire time

00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:42,960
I love shipping software and I love

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,410
shipping software that people love and I

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,789
want to enable you to also ship that

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,500
software as a community architect my

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,989
Charter is to find and remove

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,359
impediments to developer engagement in

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,589
the hyper ledger community but for the

00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,379
purposes of this talk I'm going to

00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:03,690
expand that a little bit and say that it

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,250
is to find remove impediments to people

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,079
getting engaged in the hyper lighter

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,470
community and of course you are those

00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:14,009
people that we need so a quick show of

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,270
hands who here is a developer ok

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:20,850
excellent and get ho profiles you guys

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,899
get okay so like mostly developers and

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:28,340
who here is an expert not so many hands

00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:30,990
come on everyone is expert something I

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,490
would talk a little bit about hyper

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,070
ledger hyper ledger is a non-profit open

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,500
source consortium

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,990
blue links foundation which is my

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,289
employer provides the legal and

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,420
management framework the technical

00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:50,700
support for the project to do what it

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,850
does which is to develop block chains

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,990
for business use these block chains are

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:01,890
not proof of work based they have other

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,840
ways of reaching consensus and we have a

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,670
lot of companies that are competitors in

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
the marketplace that are working with us

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,520
to deliver open source block chains I

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,120
will come back to

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,460
this slide a little bit later if you

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,010
want to get involved in the community if

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,980
you are an expert and I assert everyone

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,620
is an expert in something we have

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,890
community working groups these working

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,650
groups are what helps drive and define

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,260
the development of the block chains of

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,400
the tools I want to highlight a couple

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,140
of these working groups in particular

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,780
the identity working group is working on

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,450
a very hard problem which is how do you

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,150
securely prove identity without having

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,340
your identity used against you at least

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,260
twice in the twentieth century people

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:57,200
have used secure records of identity and

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,600
group membership for genocide in Rwanda

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,390
records that were collected with good

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,890
intention were used to facilitate

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,900
genocide the same thing in the

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,010
Netherlands in World War two the

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,440
Netherlands were very efficient at

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,440
identifying Jews and they had the

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,110
highest per capita loss because their

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,540
records were so good so it's a sticky

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,980
problem it's a hard problem if you're

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,340
interested in helping solve that problem

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,920
I would ask you to get involved with the

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,930
identity working group another working

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,459
group is the public sector working group

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,350
which has only just gotten started in

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,990
the last couple of months the public

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,640
sector working group is for people who

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,610
are working in government or with

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,070
government trying to find use cases and

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,260
solutions to problems that can be solved

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,630
with blockchain I was recently in a

00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,150
conference in Seattle I was talking with

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,550
Navy leadership US Navy leadership and

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,220
they have a lot of interesting problems

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,380
that they are trying to solve one of

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,560
those is the provenance of replacement

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,959
parts you want to know the life cycle of

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,900
a part if a particular part has been

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,820
found to be defective or needs replace

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,010
fleet-wide where are all of those parts

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,660
water the history of those parts those

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,810
are the types of problems that the Navy

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,510
is trying to solve land ownership land

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,470
ownership records are also difficult in

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,989
the developing world

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,100
land ownership records may not exist it

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,690
may be that your family has lived

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,610
a piece of land for several hundred

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,100
years but there is no actual written

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,010
record of that in the developing world

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,410
you can use blockchain to help

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,120
facilitate the recognition of the wealth

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,430
that that family has in terms of the

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,710
land in a way that cannot be taken when

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,580
someone decides to change the rules it's

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,230
the same issue in the developed world

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,240
where if you've ever bought a house you

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,890
know when you're going through title

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,930
clearance and finding out what claims

00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,770
exist on the land it's hard and it's

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,900
expensive blockchain the public sector

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,320
working group is working on land title

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,670
issues a group that just spun up in the

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,290
last few weeks is a social impact

00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:09,870
working group a social impact working

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:13,650
group their Charter is to find use cases

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,300
where you can use blockchain for social

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:20,070
good if you are interested they just

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,460
started I don't even think they've had a

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:27,560
formal meeting yet if you think you have

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,240
something to add please jump on board

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,460
the last one that I want to discuss

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,410
discuss in detail is the health care

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,810
working group the health care working

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,520
group is pretty healthy they're fairly

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:44,130
robust they have a meeting every other

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:47,490
week and they have split up into a few

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,170
subgroups they have subgroups for supply

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,680
chain in healthcare for the payer

00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,480
subgroup for the EMR subgroup if you've

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,490
ever dealt with electronic medical

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,640
records in your personal life you know

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,200
difficult it can be to have ownership of

00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,330
those records which are very important

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,810
to you right those are records about you

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,250
and it's very difficult to transfer them

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,640
and to prove provenance and to make sure

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,670
that they have not been messed with the

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,230
patient member subgroup is also very

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,240
active so active in fact that they

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,120
developed a sub sub group which is the

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,120
donor milk project the Dover mail donor

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:31,300
donor milk project is to facilitate the

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,940
tracking and delivery of breast milk

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,659
as it turns out breast milk like blood

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:40,240
is something that people are at risk

00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:43,180
that they need that they cannot get and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,379
much like blood there are networks some

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,680
of which are formal and some of which

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,800
are informal where women can donate

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,229
breast milk and where where parents or

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,889
people who are caring for infants can

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,289
request it

00:06:53,889 --> 00:07:00,340
many of these are essentially private

00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:01,810
Facebook groups this group feels that

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,129
being they will be able to use watching

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:09,159
to more effectively match donors with

00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:12,250
the people who are in need of breast

00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:15,250
milk the infant's who's you know lives

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,990
are at stake this gives me an

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,310
opportunity to brag about my sister a

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:24,669
little bit my sister attorney practicing

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,860
lawyer in Illinois she got involved in

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,780
the health care working group she got

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,990
involved in the in the donor milk

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:37,659
project and her feeling after attending

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:41,020
a few of the meetings was that she was

00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:43,330
the only person on the call who had ever

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,389
actually pumped milk she was the only

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:51,219
person on the call who had raised kids

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:54,330
there was a huge amount of ignorance

00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:58,240
about the motivation about why people

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:01,960
get involved this is what I mean when I

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:06,219
say everyone is an expert she is a

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:09,099
professional she is a lawyer and she was

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:12,159
able to apply this expertise which was

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:14,620
not obvious to anyone else that was

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,569
already in the group to move that group

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,080
forward and move them in a better

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,080
direction

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:29,270
for developers we have a lot of projects

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,270
a lot of places for you to get involved

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:39,210
we have five blockchains as you can see

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:41,340
across the top of the slide we have they

00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,880
are implemented in a bunch of languages

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:47,310
so if you are interested and you want to

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,530
get involved in developing the

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,790
blockchains themselves and you are an

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:56,670
expert in Boro is written in go for

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,530
instance fabric is also written in go if

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:04,080
you are an expert in go those projects

00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:05,810
need you in de I not I don't remember on

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,860
top of my head what India's written in

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:15,690
Roja is C++ and Sawtooth is Python and

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:18,540
moving to rust fabric and Aroha and

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,480
sawtooth all have SDKs for various

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,010
languages so if you want to write smart

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,590
contracts and a language of your choice

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:28,160
for instance fabric allows you to write

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:34,650
smart contracts and go natively and

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,870
Sawtooth sports EVM burrow is the

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,050
reference implementation of the EVM it's

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,440
EVM 1.0 that what that code base was

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,980
donated through sovereign and it's now

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,200
part of the hyper later foundation we

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,850
have quite a number of tools for

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,520
measuring and understanding block chains

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,920
we have caliper caliper is a new project

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,720
is a performance measuring tool for

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,790
block chains it supports several block

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,010
chains it's of course all this is

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,590
apache2

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,170
cello is an interesting project it is

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,270
block chain as a service it allows you

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:16,620
to orchestrate your block chain networks

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:20,490
it supports ec2 it supports OpenStack I

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,740
even pretty sure it's parse GCE composer

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,490
is also interesting allows you to build

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,640
your business cases in a fairly nice UI

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,769
essentially in JavaScript and build your

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,600
block chain network to support that

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:36,129
explorer allows you to view and explore

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,089
your data on the blockchain that code

00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:41,680
came in from DTCC and hyper laser colt

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,339
is an implementation of the inter layer

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,980
protocol which allows you to link assets

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:55,860
on one chain to assets and transactions

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:55,860
on another chain any questions nope

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,150
we have meetups if you are looking for a

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,070
way to get engaged in the community

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,590
meetups are an easy way to find people

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,540
that are interested in the same thing

00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,550
that you're interested in if you are

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,320
looking to get speaking opportunities a

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,480
lot of the meetups that I have been

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,660
involved in are hungry for speakers if

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,550
you are an expert they are looking for

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,990
people to talk about what they're

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,620
working on the problems they're trying

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:31,690
to solve the use cases that they have

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,470
this is a great opportunity for you as

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,900
an expert to get involved and engage

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:44,680
with the community and change the future

00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:47,950
of hyper ledger we have a lot of tools

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,010
for you to engage with the community we

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,010
have a chat system a lot of mailing

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,170
lists all of our repos are on github we

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,620
have a wiki which is moving to

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:03,130
confluence and we have bug reporting we

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:07,540
also have a bug bounty for security bugs

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:11,380
on fabric we have been awarding bounties

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,260
of up to $5,000 for bugs have been found

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,020
in fabric for CDs and fabric and the

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,120
like if you are a security researcher

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:23,400
and you would like to make some money I

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,400
think fabric is a rich environment for

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,860
coding it is much like any other

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,160
open-source project it's simple

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:37,870
grab the guides get the repo find an

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,240
issue and jump in it is fairly

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,730
straightforward to get on chat with a

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,890
very active chat community if you want

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,630
to get on the Sawtooth channels or on

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,090
the fabric channels those are easily the

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,250
most active and I think you'll find

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,930
developers that are greedy for pull

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,530
requests everyone likes to get bugs

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,570
fixed everyone likes to add features and

00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:01,150
I think you will find a very receptive

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,780
audience to your to your proposed

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,780
changes

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:12,390
we have resources to get involved we

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,720
have a couple of free EDX courses this

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:19,320
EDX course is about 40 hours a little

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,110
bit over 40 hours if you work through

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,810
the first 10 or 12 hours you're gonna

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,700
know more than most of the people that

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,480
you run into the claim that there are a

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:33,180
blockchain expert I think it is worth

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,800
your time to spend a few evenings to

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,740
start on the EDX course and start

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,620
working our way through one thing that I

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,820
would ask is that if you do complete it

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,430
keep in mind that you can help pull

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,760
someone along find someone in your life

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,130
who is also interested and help work

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,840
with them and get them involved help

00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,090
them take the EDX course it's really a

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,710
great resource even if you're not a hypo

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,810
ledger developer the the new version of

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,370
this is coming up soon I don't know

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:13,130
exactly what the release date is for it

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:15,210
but soon we have for business this is

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,290
another EDX course that we have that is

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,870
free it's more aimed at business as the

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:26,850
business users so if you're interested I

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:30,120
would ask you to take this course we

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,830
have a big meetup in Basel in December

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,740
