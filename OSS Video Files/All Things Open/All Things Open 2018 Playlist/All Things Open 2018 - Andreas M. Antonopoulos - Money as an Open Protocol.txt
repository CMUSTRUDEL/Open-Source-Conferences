please help me welcome Andreas M

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:19,289
Antonopoulos Wow thank you so much for

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:26,130
that introduction appreciate it

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:28,800
I hate podiums so much that I asked them

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,929
to spend that extra time to remove it so

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,090
I'm gonna be pacing ideally I'd like a

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,219
bridge so that I could pace all the way

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,600
to that other stage it's extremely

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,309
tempting right now because I know

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,780
everybody's sitting over there has

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,059
probably got a crick in their neck at

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:49,020
this point I am so excited to be here

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,780
all things open is an amazing conference

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,120
an amazing event and I I feel really

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,050
fortunate to have been invited to attend

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,329
this and to speak here open source has

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,899
been a dominant theme in my professional

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,479
life but also in my private life it's

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,659
something that has changed my life I

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,950
first got involved in open source when

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,390
it wasn't really cold open source in

00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:20,729
1991 as a young students in England and

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,869
everything I do is open all of my work

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,549
is available on the Creative Commons

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,159
licenses including my to O'Reilly books

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,240
which is one of the reasons I picked

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,920
O'Reilly because they're the kind of

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,740
publisher who will do an open source

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,280
book so everybody excited to get started

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,580
whoo

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:53,330
[Applause]

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:57,260
money is the root of all evil we can't

00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:00,200
even talk about it it's a taboo it's a

00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,150
taboo in almost every society and in

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,930
Western societies it's a greater taboo

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:08,090
than sex I probably violate the conduct

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:11,900
policy of this conference if I started

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,300
talking about sex on stage but it's

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,070
something that society would find more

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,560
acceptable than if I started talking

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:24,140
about my personal desire to accumulate

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:30,470
money because that's the thing we can't

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:34,370
talk about we all do it but we can't

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:40,130
admit that money is an important

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:43,340
component of our daily life it's taboo

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:50,660
to say that to think it to speak it out

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:52,340
loud so what we do is we lie we lie to

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,500
ourselves and to everyone around it and

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:57,350
we say things like I don't care about

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,959
money or money doesn't drive any of my

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,070
decisions and of course there is a

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:08,110
pathological aspect to pursuing money

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,250
just like you can be addicted to sex and

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,989
addiction to the pursuit of money is a

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:17,510
pathology but simply the pursuit or

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,940
interest in money or the use of money or

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,730
the impact it has on our lives that

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:30,770
isn't pathological that is a normal

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:34,130
aspect of a scalable society in order to

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,560
have a society that scales beyond the

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:40,070
dumb bar number beyond the hundred and

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,070
fifty individuals in a tribe we need a

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:46,700
neutral means of communicating value to

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:52,239
each other to build trade to build

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:55,750
governance to build organizations and

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,850
sometimes to also build social bond

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,490
you can take money and use it to exploit

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,940
other people you can use money in a gift

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:07,640
society to strengthen social bonds to

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,520
support other people to bring change to

00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,490
people's lives you can express value in

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,420
forms that are altruistic and yet the

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:27,130
taboo process money is the root of all

00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:27,130
evil I hear that and I think sue do evil

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:36,220
you see the real issue is not money it's

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,350
who has root access

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,370
who has root access to this

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,010
thing and because it's taboo we don't

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,310
understand what it is how it works and

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:54,170
most importantly who has root access to

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:57,260
this it's a technology it's a technology

00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,260
that's more ancient than writing how do

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,400
we know the very earliest forms of

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:10,670
writing we have found our Ledger's of

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:13,460
money arguably money created the need to

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,060
invent writing in order to account for

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:21,170
debt the very first clay tablet that we

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,980
have found is a ledger that accounts for

00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:28,730
trade and the very second thing we've

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:33,320
written was a customer service complaint

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:38,200
for the quality of copper delivered to a

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,200
customer I'm not kidding

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:47,050
who has roots to this technology what is

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,790
this technology how does it work

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,690
most people have an elaborate

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,070
constructed mythology about money that

00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,500
bears very little resemblance to the

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:03,590
truth very few people understand bonds

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,350
Treasury notes central banking

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,120
fractional reserve International

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,870
Monetary Fund's Special Drawing rights

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,669
and the relationship between gold's oil

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,930
exchange rates floating currencies

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:22,889
Bretton Woods who gives a you

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:26,810
should this is an ancient technology

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:30,660
that is a fundamental part of any

00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,840
society it is required in order to

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:37,590
function as a society at scale and yet

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:43,740
most of us have a story about it that is

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:50,160
as realistic as santa claus i get asked

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:52,380
often what backs Bitcoin and I ask

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,160
people will walk backs a US dollar and

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,039
they say to me the gold that's in Fort

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,410
Knox

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:02,940
it's astonishing to me that educated

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,750
adults will say things like that

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,699
obviously that's not how money works in

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,250
fact if you sit down with someone and

00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:15,990
explain how money works and you explain

00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:22,139
fractional reserve they tell you it's a

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:25,110
scam so a bank takes one dollar and then

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:29,130
creates nine dollars out of nothing and

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:36,840
then earns interest on that by lending

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:40,710
it out surely that's illegal money isn't

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,990
just a technology it's language it's a

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,949
language we use to express value because

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:50,490
money itself doesn't have value money is

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:53,099
a carrier protocol for value it is a

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,380
protocol that allows people who use the

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,229
same protocol to exchange information

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,229
about the value they place on goods and

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,840
services money itself has no value

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:07,020
because money is the language that

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,389
expresses value it is how as a species

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,090
we communicate to each other about the

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,130
things we find valuable and it serves a

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:19,650
very important purpose in society which

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:22,050
is the allocation of resources by using

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,900
money we can assign value by assigning

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,000
value we can do

00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,060
cover what matters and what doesn't in

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,760
our daily lives and how much it matters

00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:36,700
exactly it's a measure of value but

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,460
fundamentally it's a protocol who has

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,650
root access that is the fundamental

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,650
question we need to be asking about this

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:50,350
every important protocol in our society

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:55,180
has become an open protocol just in the

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,620
last 30 or 40 years except money money

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,050
continues to this day

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,959
for the most part to be a closed

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,510
protocol that connects closed and

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,440
centralized systems where somebody else

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:13,320
has roots it's not a peer-to-peer

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:16,180
architecture it's a master/slave

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:21,580
architecture and if you're not the

00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:23,560
master guess what you're the slave it is

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:29,860
very important to understand who has

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:32,860
roots in this protocol and so on January

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,540
3rd 2009 a new form of money was

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:42,160
invented Bitcoin and it is changing the

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:45,640
world from the bottom up because Bitcoin

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,850
as a new form of money is an open

00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,900
protocol based on open source systems

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,180
and appear to pier architecture it is a

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,900
system of money where every participants

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:03,459
can independently verify the veracity of

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:07,150
a claim over ownership where every

00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:10,510
participants does not have to access a

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:14,050
server that will tell it if that money

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:18,820
exists or doesn't where every

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:21,550
participant has Authority through the

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:25,300
evaluation of the protocol where the

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,540
rules are written clearly in open source

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,600
software and can be examined by anyone

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:36,850
where most importantly no one has root

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,120
it is a purely decentralized system

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,149
where everyone has the same amount of

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,240
power the power to decide how to

00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:48,519
validate the rules on their own systems

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,800
and if they follow the rules as

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,649
everybody else does they can get

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,660
rewarded they can participate they can

00:10:53,649 --> 00:11:02,730
independently verify and authenticate

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:04,449
money so what is this Bitcoin thing is

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,160
it just money

00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:13,209
no it's an implementation of a protocol

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,019
for money that establishes trust between

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:19,810
participants who cannot trust each other

00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:24,459
but can trust in the validation of rules

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,930
and these rules create a platform that

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:32,319
can be used to run applications

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:36,399
applications of trust you don't trust

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:38,740
the others in the system you trust the

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
rules of the system because you run the

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:45,880
rules of the system and validate them

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,769
yourself or your software does and by

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,019
building a platform of trust we can

00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,319
immediately create the first and most

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,420
obvious application which is money

00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:58,029
because money requires Trust in order to

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,240
operate and the fundamental problem with

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:04,410
not having a decentralized platform for

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,430
trust is that every previous

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,430
implementation of money we have had

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:18,180
requires us to place trust in the root

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:22,240
access institution the root access

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:25,509
individuals in the organizations that

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,420
issue and distribute money and that

00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:35,319
gives those organizations enormous power

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:38,949
over society what better way to hack

00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:44,680
society what better way to undermine

00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:46,809
democracy than to gain root access to

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,089
the fundamental protocol we use to

00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,470
express value to each other to the

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,770
system we use to

00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:56,860
rice resources and to decide what to

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,590
allocate resources on and now we have a

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,860
new way of doing things and this new way

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,950
of doing things starts with money but it

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,590
doesn't end with money you'll hear

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:11,770
people say things like bitcoin is a

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:18,760
blockchain that's a bit like saying a

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:22,090
car is a transmission it's a component a

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,160
blockchain is a component in fact it's a

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,350
data structure my favorite definition is

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,140
that the Peter Tod gives which is it is

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:36,270
a chain of blocks what matters actually

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:40,060
isn't the data structure but who has

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:42,540
roots who has the power to record things

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,900
on the blockchain and the answer that

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,930
open public neutral censorship resistant

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,570
borderless block chains give is the

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,760
consensus algorithm and the consensus

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,450
algorithm is the set of common rules and

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,630
a way to achieve finality immutability

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:05,940
and synchronization between disparate

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,770
participants a distributed systems

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,930
solution to the Byzantine generals

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,670
problem of coordination across distances

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,650
between parties that do not trust each

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,680
other and do not trust the underlying

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,540
medium it's not an implementation of

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,660
cryptography it's an implementation of

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:26,620
distributed systems it uses cryptography

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,500
to establish trust but the most

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:34,800
important thing is no one has root the

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:39,300
rules are strict but there are no rulers

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,820
this model for trust changes everything

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,910
it changes the way we will be governing

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,760
societies in the future the opportunity

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,690
to have a neutral platform with very

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:58,120
very specific and strict rules but no

00:14:52,690 --> 00:15:00,220
rulers changes society it gives us an

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,530
opportunity to reimagine how we do

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,180
decision-making governance and build

00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,960
applications of trusts

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,580
and we can't talk about the most obvious

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,480
application of trust which is money

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:16,330
because it's taboo but fortunately

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,310
that's not the only application there

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,500
are so many other applications of trust

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,940
and governance perhaps is one of the

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,690
greatest ones governance means democracy

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,790
governance means elections and voting

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,820
governance means how you run a

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,710
corporation and how you make decisions

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:40,380
within a corporation's governance is

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,050
shareholder votes governance is

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:47,650
municipal decision-making governance is

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:50,860
local council and all of those are

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:53,230
applications of trust and all of those

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,040
can be rewritten to run on a platform

00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:01,980
that has rules without rulers and when

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:07,420
you do that you take away root access

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:11,410
no one has sue do over this society it

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:14,560
is an open system it has a set of rules

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:18,100
and when you describe this to most

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,570
people at first they think surely this

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:30,330
can't work it's anarchy and anarchy

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:34,810
sounds terrible but the opposite of

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:39,460
authority isn't chaos the opposite of

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:42,100
authority is autonomy and systems that

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:45,490
have strict rules but no rulers give you

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:49,120
the maximum amount of autonomy that you

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:51,670
can achieve in a system remove authority

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,410
things don't fall apart as long as you

00:16:51,670 --> 00:17:00,280
introduce autonomy open block chains are

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,730
a protocol that will allow us to finally

00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,820
open the most important technology and

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:09,040
application we have in society and all

00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:13,440
of the other forms of trust that we use

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,490
on a daily basis now why does it work

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,680
how does it work

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,350
what can I do with it

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,750
all those questions follow from this and

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:27,730
you don't have to take my word for it

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:32,590
you can read the code and you can see

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:36,070
how it works how does it work as a 420

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,860
page answer published by O'Reilly but

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:42,190
also available on github the project is

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,230
Bitcoin book my last book is a theory in

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,600
book go check it out

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,420
make a pull request it's got bugs and

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,460
errors in it make a pull request it's an

00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,230
open book you can read it you can run

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:58,840
the code you can figure out what it does

00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,640
and the same thing applies to Bitcoin we

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,530
are on the cusp of a fundamental

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,110
transformation that is going to rival

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,030
the Industrial Revolution and I make

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,050
these enormous pronouncements and people

00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:15,790
look at me funny that's okay

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,180
the bottom line is that all of our

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,850
fundamental social institutions today

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:24,910
were forged in the Industrial Revolution

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:28,590
they are direct outcomes of our renewed

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:32,700
conception of time and space our

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:37,780
understanding of mechanistic processes

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:40,090
our ability to organize a society based

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:47,550
on models that look very much like

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,550
machines systems of production

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:56,350
manufacturing processes these things are

00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:00,670
reflected in our institutions we run our

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:04,330
democracies like factories we run our

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,970
governments like corporations but

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:11,830
corporations governments and factories

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:15,550
are all directly derived from the

00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,710
Industrial Revolution and don't get me

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,780
wrong a lot of people think that part of

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,150
the motivation behind Bitcoin is this

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,800
idea that we don't need governments or

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,600
governments are evil or will just

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,600
replace them with a small Python script

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:38,550
and the big thing we're missing here is

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,940
that there's nothing inherently evil

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:45,750
with governments of course the problem

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,450
is that while these institutions the

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:53,170
liberated billions of people from feudal

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,050
lords and royalty and kings and princes

00:19:53,170 --> 00:20:02,200
and intrigue and Game of Thrones

00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:04,060
politics at some point fail to scale and

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,670
as an engineer I look at that and I

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,830
think what is wrong here is it a

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,960
protocol problem is it a design problem

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,450
is it an architecture problem and the

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,580
answer is all three but fundamentally

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,500
it's an architecture problem and the

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,670
architecture problem that we have is

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,230
centralization of control as hierarchy

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,930
pyramidical hierarchy which is a

00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,710
fantastic structure if what you're

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,990
replacing is a one-person rule and

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,470
certainly opens up a lot more

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:37,390
participation does not scale you reach a

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,280
point where decisions made at the top

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,230
are so far removed from the bottom of

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,170
the pyramid that they're not good

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,390
decisions anymore and the impact of

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,430
those decisions rolls down and gets

00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,320
diluted over time so that those making

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,780
the decisions become more and more

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,230
distant from the people whose decisions

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:59,800
whose from the people their decisions

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,950
are affecting hierarchy doesn't scale

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,230
and so how do we solve the problem that

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,860
all of our fundamental institutions of

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,600
society fail to scale we try to put

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,340
together super states and super

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,470
structures the European Union the

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:17,500
Russian Federation the United States of

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,450
America and then we try to take a 19th

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,400
century model and scale it to three

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,200
hundred and sixty million people four

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,200
hundred and fifty million people a

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:36,290
billion people and what do you end up

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:40,870
with the tyranny of men it's not evil

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:43,910
it's disconnection apathy unintended

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:49,790
consequences it's architecture feeling

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:52,809
on a massive scale because hierarchy

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:56,140
doesn't scale and how do we solve that

00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:59,540
this is how we solve it peer-to-peer

00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:03,070
open source opening our protocols

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,299
opening our structures and creating

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,840
participatory systems where

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:13,280
participation is voluntary but power

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:18,250
rests in no one we take back routes

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:21,490
access and we start with money thank you

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,490
