you wanna get ahead whoa hello if you're

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,630
gonna get ahead of the curve go ahead

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,160
and go to IBM doc cloud and sign up

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,120
we're going to give you a promo code so

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,980
you'll be able to do this stuff for free

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,490
and then also if you want to pull down

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,289
that github URL that is the actual

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,500
working doc that we're gonna be going

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,730
through or exercises my main goal and

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,900
I'll say this again when we first start

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,130
so I think we still got another two ten

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,119
twenty minutes is I want you all to come

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,560
out of this workshop with something

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,480
tangible and you feel like you've

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,540
learned my philosophy and I'll say this

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,489
again is I know this stuff is hard and

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,930
instead of spending three weeks of your

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,000
life trying to figure this thing out by

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,800
yourself we're gonna come together do

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,239
this in a very short amount of time hit

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,700
all the major high points so you're at

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,079
least dangerous when you get back home

00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,789
hopefully that's good oh by the way I

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,320
use a lot of profanity I don't even know

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,600
I do so if you have problems with that I

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,039
apologize ahead of time and I'll say

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,160
that again here at gump minutes thank

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,160
you

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,070
check-check

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,990
okay okay good hey so um I made a

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,720
mistake don't go to that original URL I

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,729
sent I'll go to that URL that's a better

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,330
URL it has cooler things you should

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,479
probably go

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,250
so joke people people giggle come on so

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,630
go to that URL click on that or if you

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,430
did go to the old URL how about you

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,410
click on that URL anyway that'd be kind

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,820
of cool too it's our tracking URL to

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,790
make sure that you know we're doing our

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,530
jobs so I'll be honest I mean I have no

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,060
reason to I that's how I can actually

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,340
come and do more of these things and if

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,120
you like it I can do more of them ya

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,080

stuff why I do it right I like it thank

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,270

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,220
so about a minute early I hope that's

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,710
okay bye y'all

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,310
okay so we've identified a few things

00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,770
already first of all my name is JJ

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,870
that is my name and that's my contact

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,730
information if you haven't gone to the

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,110
first URL which you should have gotten

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,320
on a sheet by some of my lovely

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,240
assistants please go to that URL try to

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,410
sign up we've identified a problem

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,000
already and you might have an issue

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,610
there please raise your hand or gonna

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,310
get someone who's in an IBM t-shirt to

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,410
be like WTF then we can start work on

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:15,490
that a little more there's the github

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:19,210
URL and yes we're gonna have some fun

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:22,060
today I acknowledge this is not the

00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,820
grass best room for a workshop I'm sorry

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,960
this is the room they gave us so we're

00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,520
gonna do the best we can with what we

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,310
got

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,200
also yes I realized we're all have

00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:36,960
laptops in front of us and there's no

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:48,550
power I'm sorry that's horrible

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:50,740
okay cool so this is the actual github

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,000
repo and before I start talking

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:57,610
who knows what sto is who knows what

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,240
kubernetes is there we go that's what I

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,190
was more expecting okay cool so if tio

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,020
is an open source project the sits

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:10,510
between our there's collaboration

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,800
between IBM GCP or Google and and lyft

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,880
believe or not so if you're not using

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,080
left you should probably usually left

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:22,270
review a lot interested interested in

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,190
this deal so let us first go to the

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:29,020
workshop

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:31,540
exercise 1 assuming you have been able

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,490
to log in you're going to be you're

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,260
gonna want to do the unless you're an

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,840
IBM employee I know there are some IBM

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,790
employees in here go ahead and just do

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,560
the IBM login and be able to get to get

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,760
into the system which is good if you

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,820
haven't gotten there yet that's fine

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,750
we'll work with it

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,610
I'm gonna go make

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:53,170
sure that this the most important

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,460
partion is you get your kubernetes

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,080
cluster up and running it does take a

00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,910
few minutes to start going so if you get

00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,650
that done now then I can start working

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:04,300
on the actual presentation to talk about

00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:06,880
it while it's being built so everyone's

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,560
doing that yes I need interaction here

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,190
people I'm just gonna otherwise meander

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,190
around yes hello

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:24,210
they are not working at all has anyone

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:28,300
gotten a code to work okay well let us

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:34,060
start with the overview of this do how

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:37,720
about that this is going the most

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,810
important picture you will see about sto

00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,880
is this I can go into the long spiel

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,740
about the different portions of it and

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
all but this is the workshop that we're

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,020
going to do we're actually gonna use it

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,450
we're actually gonna play with it to

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,930
kind of understand how to understand the

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,640
the power of it

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,839
there are formerly important components

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:00,250
which is pilot mixer and citadel who

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,360
thinks whether they know what Citadel is

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,640
because I don't some sounds pretty

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,100
obvious anyone nothing yeah hello yes

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,690
it's the security portion of Sto it's

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,000
the one who actually has the the ability

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,540
to say yes or no it is the Citadel if

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,040
you will what do you think mixer does

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,089
I'm assuming the name could give it away

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,120
so again policies um its that's accurate

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,010
yes it mixes in different systems so as

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,630
we go through the sidecar and the way

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,880
the actual pods start talking to one

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:33,670
other that's where the other portions

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,830
kind of branch off of and pilot is

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:42,160
obviously the no I do not believe it is

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:45,940
a sidecar it is the it's the actual and

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,500
the the controller of the entity right

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,500
it is the pilot which is nice

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,600
sto has the concept of sidecars where as

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,440
you heard for that gentleman a moment

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,200
ago the ability to inject your

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,720
pod it's not something on the side and

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,090
then sto actually can say yes or no to

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,620
that traffic the way I've worked it in

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,230
the way I actually got it over my head

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,630
is that it's a traffic controller so who

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,330
likes to do rolling things in production

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,610
a not caring about anything just Yolo it

00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,940
 it why not let's do it right I like

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,820
you

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,410
let's go No your boss will never let you

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,200
do that right no it's not going to

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,970
happen that way you need to be able to

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,900
roll something out with a canary you

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,280
need to be able to do a small amount you

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,080
can go all the way down to the

00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:41,660
user-agent of the actual web browser and

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,540
say hey only firefox should have version

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,650
2 of my system or only the user agent

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,770
for a beta system for your i'm phone or

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,960
whatever you can go that granular that

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,890
is unbelievably powerful especially with

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,160
how quick you want to move with your

00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:00,170
micro-services systems now that is how I

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,500
finally actually clicked in my head and

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:08,089
we will be as soon as we get our urban

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,360
areas clusters up I like with

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,650
them it's fun though as soon as we do

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,589
that well actually go to go and walk

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,350
through that which is pretty cool right

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,170
yes ok cool I like it I'm looking for

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,150
feedback here people do we have hand

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,520
Mike spiny a chance if anyone has any

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,810
questions or anything like that or I can

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,720
have one of my assistants running around

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,640
because I yes hello yes give a question

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:39,110
no ok just fine

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:41,540
ok ok again this was really not a great

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:53,050
room for a workshop I was expecting like

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:57,550
a classroom setting so yeah anyway ok so

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,550
there are let's see

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,009
I'm trying to think of things to talk

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,049
about before going too deep without

00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,549
actually walking through the material

00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,399
because it's really hard to walk through

00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:15,409
the material without extra the concepts

00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:15,409
so what's I do anything anything okay so

00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:21,809
the as you can see the commands are

00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:27,269
pretty straightforward but what the most

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:30,049
important portion is hopefully as we're

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:32,399
waiting for our clouds to be a cloud

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:34,590
please curl that URL and that'll

00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:36,840
actually pull down sto for you it is as

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,129
we know an open source project and yes

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,860
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to pipe it

00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:42,929
through Sh I mean I realize people don't

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,470
like you know curl bash and even or curl

00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:49,350
SH now but it'll pull it down it should

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,570
be 1.0 to that is how I validated it

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,340
multiple times so if you can verify that

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,889
and give me a thumbs up when that shows

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,090
up it should extract it for you too and

00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:58,799
you should actually have all the

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:03,330
deployment mechanisms and things like

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:09,240

yes gks works just fine and I've

00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:58,089
actually tested I should should I say

00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,189
this out loud why not so that if you

00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,359
don't know where the inversion 1 1 is

00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:03,909
going to come out with an extended mesh

00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:06,909
I've actually been able to get the I be

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:10,119
M cloud extended into gke with this

00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:13,169
extend of mesh of mystia which is that's

00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:16,299
pretty sexy that's pretty sexy

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:19,679
cross-class Cloud Control Service Master

00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:22,719
no nothing okay maybe that's just me so

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,849
yes if you have if you have mini cube oh

00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,719
if you are running mini cube kick it up

00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,779
to 4 gigs

00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:32,019
do not do it at the 2 gig if you want to

00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:34,239
get ahead sto and two gigs don't really

00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:38,739
fit together by fit I mean it'll

00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:51,999
basically melt your laptop yeah it's not

00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:55,479
good yeah so I was if you have a nexus

00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:57,489
access to another kubernetes instance if

00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:58,599
we want to create over there Wi-Fi here

00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:03,369
we could all start pulling down mini

00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:06,719
cube I'll wait for nibs to give me the

00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:06,719
okay on the final suggestion

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,940

you're gonna need a some kind of an sto

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,600
CTL a Kubb CTL and the IBM cloud CLI and

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,260
both all those are available kind of at

00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,420

00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:35,429
right there right question

00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,429
agreed um

00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,250
absolutely absolutely agree with you on

00:24:48,429 --> 00:25:02,110
that and fighting a good flight over

00:24:51,250 --> 00:25:09,250
here I have yeah I only have so much

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:10,630
pull yeah well what would you think of

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,450
using like a docker container instead

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,830
and doing a docker pull would that feel

00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,360
the same or would you feel like that's

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,360
um I'm sorry it's taken

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:34,330
yep what luckily I have a feedback form

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,770
at the end of this that I would love for

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:38,790
you to put those thoughts down then I

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:44,920
can actually come back and say yeah well

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:46,840
yeah I I do actually have a docker

00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,520
container built with all this stuff if

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:55,420
you want pull that - I wasn't supposed

00:25:48,520 --> 00:26:08,440
to talk about it though if this makes

00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:10,180
you feel any bit better here it is and

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:27,610
you can look at the actual docker file

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:32,170
right there - oh my god that's the

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:39,460
problem that's the problem okay where's

00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:41,850
that I didn't know that was two

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,850
different things

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,320
no sorry

00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,530
this one

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,620
yeah this brings in everything and

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,880
that's kind of the reason why I was

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:17,260
going back to the cloud native thing

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,260
that will in suggested me

00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,210
what the

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,020
so if you want to if this might be

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,020
quicker sir

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,380
is it okay I have don't push rights to

00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,710
the repo so I don't know how to get this

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,710
out to people

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,710
it's amazing

00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,910
so that the the cloud URL that we're

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,160
talking about for the COI

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:33,590
I'll please go to that bitly it's very

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,590
long I know and this will actually

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,660
that's only five Meg download now which

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:42,560
is just the binary to be able to talk to

00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:46,390
it our documentation was not updated I

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,390
apologize I will get that result

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,690
because I'm going to anyone had a shot

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,460
with the COI yet been able to do

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,540
anything

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,550
someone actually clicked a link yes I

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,550
look it is okay good

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:42,910
it's for shits and giggles would have

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,200
been worth to have Ethernet cables or

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,080
everyone like if everyone's okay with

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,970
Wireless with having more problems

working now yeah so good calm I do

00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,260
we need to have another conversation

00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:48,290
want to do that well I'm thinking about

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:48,290
it works for me

00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:58,919
I'll come back in there

IBM CLI thumbs up anyone I've got one

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,319
it's better than zero

00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,300
[Laughter]

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,849
so as they're moving forward please

00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,369
verify that you have cube CTL also in

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:43,240
their cube cuddle if you don't have that

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,530
command you'll need to get that

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:50,230
installed just to make sure that's clear

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:51,730
and then also the sto setup - so when

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,059
they you get your your beautiful

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,109
kubernetes cluster here in a moment

00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:59,470
you'll have the tools to be able to talk

00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:03,099
to it feel the login access it and also

00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:08,049

and as I am showing you this also you'll

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:41,300
notice that there's the ISTE or demo

00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:42,950
here then hopefully by 1/1 which should

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,450

don't actually know it's not going to be

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,340
used at the sto deployment yamo anymore

00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,890
it's actually gonna be using helm who

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:04,660

cool Pokemon fan base there

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,700
cat's whiskers

00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,740

I'm a protractor hopefully you like

00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:42,090
those I'll beam up

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,609
so everyone has sto installed on the

00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:57,869
local machine coop cuddle and IBM cloud

00:42:54,609 --> 00:43:02,579
yes thumbs up

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:02,579
perfect get in there perfect

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,780
for sanity sake

00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,510
so one of my tricks that I've been doing

00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,860
with Cuba Nettie's recently um just in

00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,600
general to make sure I can actually talk

00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:49,560
to my kubernetes cluster when I can I

00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,670
use coop CTL coop cuddle get pods make

00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,720
sure you have your connection out there

00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,130
make sure that you're actually talking

00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,360
to what you expect to you're not you

00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:58,230
know going to do something you're not

00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,810
supposed to on to your career days

00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,430
cluster so I mean I know it's obvious

00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,750
but it's one of those things that it's

00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,250
real fast it actually gets the

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,840
information back you need and you know

00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,840
check the health of your cluster

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,599
oops

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,190
so while we're working this forward

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,710
would you want me to start going through

00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,720
the what I expected and kind of show it

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,010
just I realize more people are getting

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,540
it and they can catch up behind us and

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:35,890
we can kind of just walk through it I'll

00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,240
talk to you what's actually happening

00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,830
during that time I realized we've

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,300
spending a lot of time not doing

00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:50,260
anything and I feel like that could be

00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:52,840
valuable okay so who thinks I actually

00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,970
have sto installed nothing I thought

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,240
that was funny

00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:03,820
so if you look here this is the easiest

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:09,190
way to let's get weird characters in my

00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:12,190
terminal as you can see I don't have

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:15,400
this you actually installed on my remote

00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:24,120
machine so what I will do is I will come

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:30,940
to this beautiful actually I'm going to

00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:32,200
CD repo repo workshops sto workshop so

00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,310
as you can see I have the guestbook app

00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,930
which is what we're going to be playing

00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:42,880
around with and also sto 102 I'm going

00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:51,760
to go ahead and do coop cut tool apply -

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:57,370
eff sto install kubernetes sto demo oops

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,840
if I could only actually time so as you

00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,220
can see the namespace is created one of

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,350
the beautiful things about sto is that

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,610
it created its own namespace so it

00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,190
doesn't with anything else inside

00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:07,420
of your kubernetes cluster that's really

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,980
important when you talk to your boss

00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,320
about production right you don't want to

00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,560
take down production that's a bad thing

00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,780
so it puts it in container its namespace

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,130
so you be able to verify it I will run

00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,990
the commands to verify to show you it

00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,820
actually comes out if you looked at the

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,580
exercise there is a list of it there

00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,680
they are adding more things to the sto

00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,320
ecosystem so that that list will be

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:32,020
different over time which is unfortunate

00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,410
but that's what happens people like

00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,790
adding stuff as you can see I'm going

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:39,730
out there doing my thing

00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,260
and we're done now we actually have sto

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,870
built inside so back to that original

00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:47,320
image here where we have all of our

00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:53,620
mixer pilot citadel all that stuff I

00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:56,380
will prove to you that we have it get

00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:59,470
the service system I'm actually looking

00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,630
at the services in the the sto namespace

00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:06,810
which that is a lot bigger than I wanted

00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,810
to be so let's make that smaller oops I

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:17,440
will make it bigger again so people can

00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:21,000
see oops there we go as you can see we

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,000
have a relatively close to that same

00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:26,290
listing inside the exercise I've

00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,760
installed the ingress deep gateway

00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,460
gateway which is probably the most

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,930
important pod that you actually get

00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,140
since our service gets built inside of

00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,000
it

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,500
anyone wanted to take a random stab but

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,920
what you think an ingress gateway would

00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:44,410
do so again that is correct

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,360
it is the main entry point to your

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,030
kubernetes cluster that sto knows so a

00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,280
lot route things through as you can see

00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:53,560
there's a ton of things bound mounted to

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,020
it most importantly you'll probably

00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,580
notice these two because I know we're

00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,310
all web technologists and we all love

00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:02,710
port 80 and 443 don't be using port 80

00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,850
if you're using port 80 you need a good

00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,370
beer later because I want to find out

00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:13,120
why you should be doing 443 we all need

00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:14,260
we all need certs okay so one of the

00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,640
things that I actually didn't realize

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,080
when I was first touching the sto

00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,820
ecosystem is that there was a lot of

00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,170
things that come along with it including

00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:24,610
Prometheus and Jager service graph and

00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,190
some other wouldn't meet things they're

00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,170
all modular so by default the demo gives

00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,820
you all these these applications so you

00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,050
be able to track these things but you

00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,000
can actually switch things out if you

00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,250
need to there's a handful of projects

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,770
out there that switch out like

00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:41,350
Prometheus for another time series

00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,910
databases losing on the top of my head

00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,220
but there are other ways to do this so

00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,600
if you're you you like that certain

00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,980
flavor of ice cream and go do that thing

00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,699
it's pretty cool right

00:48:47,980 --> 00:49:00,130
and I will show that here in a moment

00:48:50,699 --> 00:49:06,059
okay and just to verify again I can't do

00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:14,400
things right there we go nice and big

00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:17,019
cube cuddle get pods and sto system as

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,729
you can see I'm not gonna make it small

00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,589
again because that's just defeat the

00:49:18,729 --> 00:49:21,969
purpose but we have all the same pods so

00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:24,130
we have the services and the pods

00:49:21,969 --> 00:49:25,869
who wants to give me just to make sure

00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,130
everyone understands in the class what

00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:34,599
is the difference between a service and

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:36,489
a pod anyone I'm saying again that is

00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,499
correct the service is the actual way

00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:41,380
for a pod can talk to the rest of the

00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:43,420
world it is the the way I think of it is

00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,400
I'm an old network engineer it's the

00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,559
ethernet port right it's the Ethernet

00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,390
port for the switch or whatever to be

00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,680
able to talk out to the world so you got

00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:52,089
when you create a pod it doesn't

00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,469
actually know about anything until you

00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,599
create a service to allow other things

00:49:53,469 --> 00:49:56,890
to talk to it so it's open up the door

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,380
make a window whatever the hell you want

00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:06,839
same if I'm wrong please tell me cuz

00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:06,839
that's how I understand this stuff okay

00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:12,809
so

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,180
assuming you have your working cluster

00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,060
of this is where we would actually be

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:28,530
installing our guestbook application and

00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:29,760
I'm going to do that now as you can see

00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:32,160
there's a bunch of deployment yeah moles

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,350
inside of here um who's comfortable with

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,810
reading or deployment ramp we were did

00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:39,540
put that bit did a deployment

00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,610
yamo and be able to walk us through what

00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,500
it does would you come up and do it come

00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:46,500
on we got a mic and everything

00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:50,490
thank you sure oh come on nothing all

00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:53,970
right well let's just take it real quick

00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,650
I had plans like as you can see I have a

00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,360
little relatively good I tried to put a

00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,350
script together for this workshop so I'm

00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,980
going to hit all these different points

00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:04,860
but the deployment yamo is a yeah mode

00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,600
that allows you to declare a way to

00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,940
deploy things which is obviously

00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,710
redundant but the most important thing

00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,930
you need to worry about and most

00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,670
deployment animals is the spec right

00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,230
here for the containers that's the way

00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,340
you can actually verify and tell what

00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,110
version the container you need to pull

00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,000
out into kubernetes I realize this is

00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:22,680
not specifically castilla but it's still

00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,420
important to know that if you you're

00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,650
trying to learn the ecosystem this is

00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,480
actually where you would manipulate it

00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:31,040
as you can see for whatever reason we've

00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,000
not done latest we've done two 8:23 and

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,760
we've actually opened up a container

00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,780
port of the Redis server so if you ever

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,500
need a minute plea like that that's

00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,430
where you need to go but you know three

00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:50,490
o'clock in the morning one day you're

00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:51,600
gonna need to write know okay so I'm

00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:57,000
gonna go ahead and create all the

00:51:51,600 --> 00:52:00,210
different services for a Redis so as you

00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:04,200
can see we have a the red semester and

00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:06,210
the red slave if I go do I'm gonna make

00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,840
this small again because when you

00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:15,980
actually see and I can't type worth a

00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:23,930
damn working

00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:24,890
ah okay cube cut' Oh get pods who think

00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:30,200
who thinks was will ya

00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:33,050
what am I gonna see gratis yes that's

00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,609
right so once again sto puts itself in

00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:36,079
its own namespace so it doesn't mess

00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,099
with it this is just me proving to you

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,560
that it does it that way

00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:41,780
even by default you puts it in the

00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,510
radius sto system so this makes sure

00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,800
that it is in its own little own little

00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:49,550
entity so you're not messing with stuff

00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:57,200
as you can see it's 35 seconds it's out

00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:59,150
there doing this thing okay so we

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,560
mentioned the sidecar earlier um this is

00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,990
where the sudden the magic of history or

00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,910
happens we're going to inject the

00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:08,810
sidecar video into our guestbook

00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:11,300
application and be able to see allow sto

00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,890
to say yes or no and many of you I

00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,140
didn't get also other information off of

00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,430
it I imagine it being I know this is

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,010
wrong and I'm sorry but this is how I

00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,510
see imagine it running like a monitoring

00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,319
service or something like that on a VM

00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:26,990
where if that's the sidecar if you will

00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:28,609
I'm I'm old school I still I'm wearing

00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,380
in this world myself too because it's

00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:32,390
constantly changing but that's how at

00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:40,430
least I got that and I got over the hump

00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:42,349
in my head so let's go as you can see

00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,660
I'm using the coop inject command that

00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:48,710
comes directly from Sto CTL or sto

00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:51,200
cuddle luckily the developers of Sto

00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:56,060
have made sure that the sto cuddle

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,470
command is very close to coop Co which

00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,900
makes life much easier because then it's

00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:02,210
kind of the same same interface same

00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,280
kind of a way to interact with it you

00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,750
know IX went through the help file and I

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,540
was like huh yeah there really did like

00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:10,460
almost verbatim do this stuff you can

00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,690
kind of feel like they want to

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,130
eventually upstream it but I don't know

00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,720
if that's in conversations by any

00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,819
standard but you can see that they

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,660
really want to make sto the one-stop

00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:26,750
shop for this so if I go ahead and get

00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:28,700
pods again who cut all get pods as you

00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,460
can see now we have three version ones

00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:37,640
of

00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:45,030
our our guestbook okay now I am going to

00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:47,180
deploy the second version as you can see

00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,080
we now have three pods three pods

00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,710
version one and version two

00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:55,500
I am going to trust y'all and we are

00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:02,790
going to put this out on the real

00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:04,890
Internet can I trust y'all no okay well

00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:08,359
I'm an idiot but we're gonna I'm gonna

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:12,599
trust y'all cube cut' Oh

00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:14,000
get get I can't type because everyone's

00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,060
watching me

00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,849
service if you would mind go to that URL

00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:24,570
on your beautiful laptops and you might

00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:25,950
actually see something I should have

00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,619
shown you originally that this was not

00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:38,220
actually there but that's what happened

00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:41,040
oh no - two - two - you should see after

00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:46,530
yelling about it being not whoa that's

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:48,720
new that shouldn't be there Oh some did

00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:55,530
somebody ask you put that in there mean

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:58,609
people so as you can see there is the

00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:02,220
actual guestbook application great

00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:04,190
thanks oh and this is actual real time

00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,890
people are actually messing with us

00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:09,480
which is great so we actually have as

00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:13,349
you notice up there on the top though it

00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,640
does say version two so we are all just

00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:17,040
talking to version two of it right now

00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,150
and during the workshop we would have

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,440
asked you to move to version one than

00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:27,300
version two and then change the amount

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:28,230
of going around all right - I will say

00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,330
thank you for not putting random

00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:33,830
profanity up there I've had you know

00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:33,830
people do that before

00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:41,359
so one of the one of the pluses of this

00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:43,130
workshop because you have been working

00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:44,809
inside of the IBM cloud we'd have

00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:47,329
actually giving you the Watson tone

00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:47,839
analyzer to play around with does anyone

00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:54,770
know who that is

00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:58,640
or what that is no okay so I was going

00:56:54,770 --> 00:57:00,200
to just say anyway the work the exit the

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,539
exercise allows you to play around with

00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,730
it and actually Watson will analyze what

00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:08,150
people are the words that are on the

00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:09,500
guestbook out when you take go home from

00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,740
here and you have the code you can play

00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:19,510
with it if you like and I worsen it okay

00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:21,740
this is where it starts getting fun so

00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:27,079
how many people know what naggy Oh says

00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:31,430
who actually likes nag yes all right

00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:33,619
all right I respect you so everybody who

00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:36,410
knows monitoring is important luckily

00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:38,390
SEO has a built-in telemetry metric

00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:41,119
system that allows you to see what's

00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,930
going on inside of your full-stack

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,750
application

00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:47,779
this comes with Griffin ax comes with

00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,740
Jaeger comes with Prometheus and you'll

00:57:47,779 --> 00:57:50,299
actually be able to get information

00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:58,720
about the different pods doing the work

00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:58,720
yeah time check guys really anyway so

00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:06,710
let us go ahead and add some telemetry

00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:08,569
to this as you can see

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:11,569
Prometheus we actually created now rules

00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:14,020
so we can actually talk to it by default

00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:16,579
you probably wouldn't want to have your

00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,339
data out on the internet so everyone can

00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:20,869
see what your application is doing there

00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:22,279
are some demos that immediately do that

00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:24,140
for you but you should you know do your

00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:26,089
homework and make sure you don't release

00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,569
your metrics to your competitors that's

00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:32,299
probably a bad idea so by default

00:58:29,569 --> 00:58:35,440
everything you have to tell sto to allow

00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:35,440
it to the real world world

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,249
and there we go we're still on the same

00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:50,229
IP which is what we were expecting

00:58:45,249 --> 00:58:52,359
and then everybody threw some day to add

00:58:50,229 --> 00:58:55,449
it because you know you like playing

00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:58,920
with me which is good so one of the

00:58:55,449 --> 00:59:01,119
beautiful things about building in with

00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,099
kubernetes is you can actually port

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,569
forward from your remote machine to your

00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:06,279
local box so you actually see what's

00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:08,709
going on I realized that there's a lot

00:59:06,279 --> 00:59:11,819
of gibberish up there but the short of

00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:15,279
it is is uses port forward for cuddle

00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:16,779
into the sto system and then pulls with

00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:20,199
some JSON path but the most important

00:59:16,779 --> 00:59:21,519
part is that a PA ger which is tracing

00:59:20,199 --> 00:59:26,380
and you be able to see what's going on

00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:28,569
and then does the port 16 back-end so if

00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:30,749
I do that you'll see that I'm doing it

00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:38,410
locally now so I can go back over here

00:59:30,749 --> 00:59:40,689
and then do port there we go done like a

00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:45,359
liar out of me please don't make a liar

00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:45,359
out of me maybe

00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,480
maybe

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,140
well imagine seeing Jaeger here for a

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,120
moment um where you can actually do

01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,860
tracing for your stat your your

01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,200
application stack where you can actually

01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,300
see what's going on where errors might

01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,770
have up here why certain all the sudden

01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,260
some micro services and being able to

01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,180
talk to some other micro service or some

01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,480
back-end or remote machines for that

01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:30,670
matter so there are ways to be able to

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:33,470
manipulate calls outside of your your

01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:36,500
kubernetes cluster using sto to be able

01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:40,250
to say hey let's pull some data from

01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:42,020
random API it turns out that api's down

01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,790
this is a way to be actually see in a

01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,410
very visual way to be able to do it I

01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:53,200
don't know why it's not showing but

01:00:45,410 --> 01:01:00,440
that's fine let's continue forward okay

01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:07,000
so your fana is pretty no yes JJ okay I

01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:07,000
like it too aha I'm an idiot localhost

01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:18,740
so here's Jaeger and if you go ahead and

01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,970
click on this and we are looking at the

01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:23,560
guestbook app which is the thing that

01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:27,530
y'all through some nice words up onto as

01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,810
you can see just a few seconds ago

01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:33,260
somebody opened up the site and there is

01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,790
the actual trace I'm gonna see something

01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:41,570
that's a little bit more exciting and

01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:43,190
there isn't which is disappointing but

01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,870
you can drill down to get some really

01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:46,940
awesome information about it you can go

01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:49,730
all the way down into what sto sees

01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:52,340
about the different services this is all

01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:55,190
built-in right so when you install this

01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,840
do this comes for free which is useful

01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:01,490
for telling your boss when hits the

01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:03,320
fan and then it actually pulls SD

01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:04,460
electro uses the internal DNS for

01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,500
kubernetes

01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:12,170
so it'll only talk to the things it

01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:13,040
needs to talk to alright so if we go

01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,480
back to Griffin ax

01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,030
everybody knows Griffin and it's all

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:23,170
pretty right

01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:26,010
yes JJ did I not get to read 3000 that

01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:26,010
isn't it like me

01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:40,470
don't you wake me that's okay

01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,240
well Gravano has some really nice data

01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:48,270
obviously it has a vise pretty graphs to

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:49,619
be able to tell you what's going on I'm

01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:51,480
gonna go ahead and skip across to the

01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:53,250
service graph this is another real cool

01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,510
tool that if you don't know what a so

01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,290
the service measure allows you to see

01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,540
what's going on

01:02:55,290 --> 01:03:02,010
all right allows you to have a letter of

01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:03,480
control of your kubernetes pods back to

01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,829
what I was saying earlier this is

01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,160
actually a really nice way to visualize

01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:09,300
it let's will actually bring up the

01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,680
service graph and you have two different

01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,809
ways of doing you can manipulate and

01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,849
there's also a dot vis version of it

01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:17,240
when you're doing your retrospectives

01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:22,260
which you all are going to be doing yes

01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,880
everyone does a retro yes yes you do

01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:26,220
retros of course you do yeah of course

01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,430
of course this is actually really I

01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,599
talked to a buddy mine at a rail shop

01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:33,900
who was moving to kubernetes and we're

01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,069
actually asking about this and I was

01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,540
like this is a really really great way

01:03:35,069 --> 01:03:38,760
to actually just print it out and throw

01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,380
it up on the wall to be like that's our

01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,849
bottleneck and it's a great way to see

01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,849
it so let's let's take a look at it now

01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:53,960
Duke do of course for a phone not found'

01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:59,220
so this is the actual like just yeah

01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,780
it's a nice little graph of what's

01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,970
actually happening so imagine you have

01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:06,809
your micro services based application of

01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,640
trillion different things you have a

01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:10,200
million different company people working

01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,020
on it this is a way to actually

01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,210
visualize what the is going on and

01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,490
it's pretty much it's not real-time

01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:20,130
because obviously it's a static dot vis

01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:23,520
but it does tell you what's actually

01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:25,589
where it's actually going so the version

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,299
one here has ten requests per second

01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:29,490
right and then version two is actually

01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:34,500
five you can manipulate the one the

01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:42,329
traffic sorry so you actually see what's

01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:43,930
going on I also like this one where you

01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:45,580
can play with it

01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:49,060
and you actually get real-time data this

01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:51,370
actually gives you real-time data well

01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,020
up to the kind of refresh your foot you

01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:55,270
know I actually get down and see what's

01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,890
going on and pull out like this policy

01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:59,200
what is it doing who what's connected to

01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:00,970
that which is nice right like it again

01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:08,980
this is free with sto to actually see

01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:12,300
what's what's happening okay you can

01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,300
read that at your leisure

01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:22,840
I don't know why we still have this in

01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:30,940
our documentation that seems really odd

01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:32,440
so don't run that so now that we've

01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,660
actually been able to see how to get our

01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,340
service our our pods talking to one

01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,920
another and the way we've actually been

01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:41,020
able to see what goes on with his

01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,720
hits the fan one of the other major

01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:46,030
powerful portions of sto is the actual

01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,560
ability to do traffic management this is

01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,900
where the nuts and bolts of this do and

01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,960
the power of it really comes together

01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,960
what's the time check games time time

01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:02,290
yeah when do we finish wonders when is

01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:05,220
this over I don't either

01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:10,630
can someone yeah I don't actually know

01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:11,820
12:30 okay so we got it awesome all

01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:22,800
right

01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:22,800
so of course so I didn't work one

01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,950
workshop

01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:41,600
okay give me two seconds in the wrong

01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:45,940
location ya know see ya so it isn't the

01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,940
one because that makes sense

01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:04,559
okay so I am now forcing all of our

01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:12,150
communication with this with this plan

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:14,400
here what this does this this is now

01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:17,099
we're talking directly to sto as you can

01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,359
see the spec of the hosts which I was

01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,579
going back earlier about saying you

01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:23,009
could tell the difference of whatever

01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:25,589
years of Aging you like to use all the

01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:26,759
way down to specific machines I've seen

01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:29,279
demos where they've actually had

01:07:26,759 --> 01:07:32,039
specific users or you have like a crazy

01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:33,900
hash that you send over with a with a

01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:35,910
curl or whatever and actually goes

01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:39,710
through your system but only into a

01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:43,079
specific container this one every one

01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:44,190
will only go to the guest book subset of

01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:48,180
v1

01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:58,380
so assuming I'm not a liar if we go back

01:07:48,180 --> 01:08:07,499
to our get our machine we should only be

01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:13,789
going to v1 now and I find out I have

01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:13,789
broken something I is just not working

01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:22,680
there we go so as you can see at the

01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:24,030
very top there we are now only if you go

01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,080
to the site also if you refresh your

01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:35,580
users only see v1 yay so we can go back

01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:43,950
to our service graph localhost dot vis

01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:45,900
as you can see here refreshing we still

01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:49,170
have some going to V someone probably

01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,880
still has the the connection still open

01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:52,920
or they've just left it open as you can

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,720
see there's still some traffic going to

01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,280
v2 but if they closed it you would

01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:01,080
notice it eventually turns to zero and

01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:03,120
all our traffic is going to v1 right and

01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:06,090
that cool we've actually now doing true

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,910
a/b testing I could go out and redo term

01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:10,680
view 2 into v3 whatever and I know mice

01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:15,060
my application is still up and running

01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:21,030
because v1 is still consider good yes no

01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:25,310
cool yay yay all right let's have

01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:25,310
something yes let's have some more fun

01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,660
all right

01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:40,810
it's not supposed to do that alright

01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,100
here we go

01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,450
this is one this is this as well as

01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,450
times had finally started clicking with

01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:49,640
me - was the user-agent story what I was

01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:53,060
mentioned earlier so now I've replaced

01:09:49,640 --> 01:10:00,710
that virtual service again and if I go

01:09:53,060 --> 01:10:02,330
back to this site this is that Firefox I

01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:04,520
was talking about as you can see there

01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:05,750
it actually reads the user agent does

01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,270
the Reg actions against intz to see if

01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:11,210
Firefox is there so I have Firefox open

01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:14,540
right now it should be if suing I'm not

01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:15,710
a liar it should be v2 and then I'll

01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,880
bring up Chrome and hopefully nothing

01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:24,560
embarrassing will show up on my laptop

01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:28,570
and we should see v1 so let's take a new

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,570
window because I don't trust things

01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:33,380
there we go

01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:35,720
v2 it's taking a little bit longer than

01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,690
it should but that's fine and then I go

01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,239
them over to Chrome and as you can see

01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:44,420
it to be one right that's pretty cool

01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:47,060
yeah so yeah thanks so it's actually

01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,770
using the user agent imagine the power

01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:53,330
that you have there like it really is

01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:54,620
cool and you have that Ogando strength

01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,390
by the way the reason why this is

01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,550
failing is because the Watson thing I

01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:05,360
didn't turn that on so hence the reason

01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:12,940
why it's angry but okay I'm gonna close

01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:12,940
Chrome close that out okay

01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:23,810
so you can actually do canary

01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:26,540
deployments now also with it going back

01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:29,630
to the same thing which I just over over

01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:32,960
wrote as you can see it actually has

01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:35,510
real waiting so if you wanted to roll

01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,000
out a small little Bluegreen deployment

01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:40,130
of a new version and you're not too sure

01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,350
you're gonna actually give only 10% of

01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:44,840
your traffic to that new feature that

01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:47,239
you're not 100% sure is gonna hit hit

01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,550
home and be able to run that very very

01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:51,199
confidently obviously I'm not going to

01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:56,000
load that much traffic on this right now

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:57,380
but it does work I will attempt to so if

01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,860
somebody else could also refresh it -

01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,860
that'd be great

01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:13,349
well that should turn into v2 but you

01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:15,090
get the point right you can actually

01:12:13,349 --> 01:12:16,710
have waiting inside of your deployment

01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:20,610
scripts to go to specific for specific

01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:25,230
things it's really making a liar I mean

01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:30,440
it as you can see here the traffic is

01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:30,440
now split between v2 and v1

01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:47,590
we're using Citadel and be able to

01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,810
actually have the control of your own

01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:51,190
ability to say yes or no somebody

01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:56,710
shouldn't be able to talking to you can

01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:57,790
have em TLS inside of your actual sto or

01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:01,450
inside of your actual kubernetes cluster

01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:04,420
so if you had some specific pods talking

01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:06,190
to some other cific pods back to the of

01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:07,390
the gentle ganda but back to the

01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:09,970
extended service mash you're gonna

01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:11,020
actually control across that service

01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,760
mesh

01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:15,070
who should be talking to what and

01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,980
actually have cryptic search back and

01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,480
forth I'm not gonna walk through this

01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:22,390
right now mainly because I'm just gonna

01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,980
make an ass of myself but I know

01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:25,450
insecured is extremely important I

01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:29,170
strongly suggest walking through this

01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:31,480
document at your own leisure because you

01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:33,840
know security is tough but we all need

01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,840
to do it

01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,750
I just want where the pen was no I'm

01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:49,350
kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding

01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:49,350
just hoping somebody would giggle okay

01:13:50,400 --> 01:14:03,460
do not use this one do not use that one

01:13:54,330 --> 01:14:05,830
well that's it this is work so what

01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,840
we'll do now is well Wilkin will

01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:09,400
dispense with the lecture portion of

01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,010
this and for those working through the

01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:13,810
exercises we'll be around for the next

01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,370
hour or so half hour 45 minutes

01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,200
something in that range and then it'll

01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:18,820
be time for lunch you have any if there

01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,350
are any questions about sto or

01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:21,790
kubernetes that are of interest to the

01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:25,720
wider group we can answer them right now

01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:29,230
but then we'll kind of break up one

01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:31,840
other thing so there I have a feedback

01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:33,840
form I realized that there's gonna be a

01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,190
lot of feedback I would like actual

01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,470
words on that so I can take it back to

01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:40,240
my powers to beat give me a moment I'll

01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:42,190
put it up here it'll be nice little just

01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:46,000
little little small little felt form to

01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:48,760
fill out and thank you thank you any

01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,020
questions I don't see anything when I

01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:59,440
can't really see anybody all right oh

01:14:50,020 --> 01:15:01,330
yeah there we go so if you have an

01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,950
existing kubernetes cluster running in

01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,630
production that's already got services

01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:07,360
and pods you can't have downtime

01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:10,060
how can you gradually deploy sto into

01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,560
that cluster all right so one of the

01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,600
open-source contributors inside IBM

01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,610
named lynn son who's around here today

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,910
actually has been working on something

01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,900
the project is umbrella termed

01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:23,350
incremental deployment or incremental

01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:25,420
adoption of Sto as you see when you turn

01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:27,970
on auto injection especially and with

01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,070
egress filtering it can be disruptive to

01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:32,650
turn on kubernetes um honestly

01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:35,110
kubernetes is not super hard to set up

01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:37,060
so forgetting you're you know I would

01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,890
recommend at the first step you know you

01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,260
spray it out in the lab or in some test

01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:42,820
cluster or something like that and then

01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:44,410
there are people who are adopting just a

01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:46,510
piece of kubernetes right they're

01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:49,390
adopting just the pilot and just a

01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:51,550
little bit of envoy just to have tracing

01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:53,050
and metrics for their services and stuff

01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,719
like that and they're not using the more

01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,909
advanced feature

01:15:53,719 --> 01:15:57,769
like virtual service and routing rules

01:15:55,909 --> 01:15:59,260
and egress filtering does that answer

01:15:57,769 --> 01:16:03,380
your question

01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:04,639
