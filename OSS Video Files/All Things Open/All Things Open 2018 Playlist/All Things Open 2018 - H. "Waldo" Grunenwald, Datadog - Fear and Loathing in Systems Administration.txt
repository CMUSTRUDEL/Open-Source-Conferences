good afternoon folks

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm Waldo and uh yeah good afternoon all

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,059
things open now they say that but behind

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,029
every great person is somebody else

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:23,760
and thanks to Dorothea I get to be that

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:25,350
somebody else so I want to thank you for

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,480
all for being here and I want to thank

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:35,010
our organizers and sponsors right as we

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:37,829
kick off but hi I'm Waldo and due to

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,980
some unfortunate AV things undo dual

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,579
dual wielding today we'll see how this

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,500
goes this is my contact information and

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,590
if you're so inclined later on you can

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,199
come get a sticker for from me but hi

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm Waldo and this is Fear and Loathing

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,649
in systems administration but first a

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,670
little housekeeping this talk isn't

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:06,000
endorsed by anyone strictly speaking

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:08,310
this is me just a boy standing in front

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
of his community asking it to make

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,200
things a little bit better I will take

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,299
questions after the show if we have time

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,549
but if you really want to talk I

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,979
encourage you to reach out to me later

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,820
my only rule is that if you heckle you

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,729
have to be funnier than I am so what I

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,460
need to know now is how many of you who

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:35,670
you are by show hands how many people

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,270
are new to DevOps awesome welcome how

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:42,299
many of you are like systems networking

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,759
operations storage again show hands wow

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,790
that's quite a lot of you how many

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:54,740
software development likewise hands

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:56,939
well like very is still hard tech but

00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,490
kind of push the outskirts

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,490
this is QA or DBA or security

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,660
[Music]

00:02:52,510 --> 00:03:00,320
there we go okay so what about other

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:06,050
business functions such as financial

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,220
legal HR administrative we should get

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,590
some of those people this conference

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,100
next time how about management or

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,500
product I can certainly I like to joke

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,630
and say people who who at one point may

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,670
have been useful but now use other

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:26,150
things yes and and do we have any design

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,510
folks woo knew there'd be there's always

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,920
one who died best day miss anybody who

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:39,530
has a rule that is outside of what I

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:44,000
described yes I yes leaders should

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,310
develop a training now the reason I ask

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,730
is because I often give this talk in the

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:53,180
context of DevOps days or DevOps track

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,650
at a conference and it's important to

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,260
realize that develop DevOps it's not

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,910
development and operations or deficit

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,380
cops or dev QA ops where you're

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,900
awkwardly smashing things together

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,810
DevOps is the company and it's

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,820
everything it's everything it's really

00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:12,320
about aligning people and perspectives

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,600
towards goals so now as I give these

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,479
develops conferences if you've ever been

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,540
to one you're going to be expecting to

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,000
hear lovely stories about sunshine and

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,310
rainbows and happiness and cooperation

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,979
and Trello and so on from from all of

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,990
our favorite companies now these are

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:32,450
fantastic because they give us hope and

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,479
a goal but they seldom describe the the

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,660
struggle of the path they describe there

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,820
now and what it was like before and

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,870
maybe a key change or so to get there

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,700
but they're usually some missing steps

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:54,770
there's usually enough content for a

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,599
DevOps drinking game now there is such a

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,140
game but I don't recommend playing it

00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:01,700
during a conference for health reasons

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,290
but instead of

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,510
talking about the glorious utopia that

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,100
is the DevOps promised land I'm going to

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,670
talk about the first steps along that

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,700
path now one final talk one final point

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm gonna be moving quickly here is the

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,070
safe word for my talk if at any time

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,830
you're feeling overwhelmed please say

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,290
the safe word clearly and we'll take a

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:33,350
break so with that let's get on with the

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:34,550
show man do wielding is hard if there's

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,380
one thing that I want you to get out of

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,780
my talk it's that you need to remember

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,110
that the people you interact with are in

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,320
fact people when you have a conflict

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,080
with somebody at work it's most likely

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,980
because your incentives and theirs are

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,860
in conflict if there's a second thing I

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,410
want you is I want teams to adopt it's

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,440
that responsibility doesn't end when the

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,970
product hits production responsibility

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,620
for a product only ends when it leaves

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:08,870
production there's a Chinese proverb and

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,540
I wish I had better citation than that

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,570
but I don't that the best time to plant

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:20,330
a tree was 20 years ago the second best

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:23,470
time to plant a tree is right now thank

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,470
you for attending my TED talk

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,590
so a number of times I've heard this

00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,360
statement is amazing the best thing

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,970
about the the phrase DevOps doesn't work

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,960
is because the people who say it are

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,490
absolutely right even if it is for

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,720
exactly the wrong reasons

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,370
now who tends to say this I'm going to

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
use the group the terms to said minced

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,500
as kind of a shorthand for a very broad

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,740
spectrum of jobs the people often have

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,480
very widely scattered job titles but

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,920
it's most commonly a combination of

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,540
systems network or operations mixed with

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,470
administrator engineer technician or

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,660
analyst and even while the suite of

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,700
names is shared the actual job

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,920
descriptions and their day-to-day

00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,930
functions can vary so widely that the

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,900
jobs are essentially incompatible

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,940
in some companies these will be the

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,639
people the best computers but in others

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,669
they have the worst the workplace

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,440
probably isn't very nice and in my

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:31,190
career it's been oddly consistent that

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,340
there's like no natural light if there's

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,620
a pager rotation they're on it if there

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,990
isn't a rotation they're basically just

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,210
on the call all the time

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:49,660
their works largely invisible unless

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:49,660
things are broken define operations

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:07,420
and this might be what you'd say their

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:09,190
typical day looks like but if one word

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,080
could be used to describe these people I

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,950
think we could agree it would largely be

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,910
cynical

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,400
I mean who here has ever had a party to

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,500
celebrate your successes you you you met

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,450
a goal you published an application you

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:28,120
met a deadline but were the Ops people

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,800
there or were they were they celebrating

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,570
were they huddled over their laptops in

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,450
the corner or did they even make it

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:39,490
there did you remember to invite them so

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,620
once he's a bunch of new faces around

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,330
the company and that's when you find out

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,560
a new products been announced a new

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,790
project a new initiative and you go well

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,690
this is the first I'm hearing about that

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:56,350
who who's gonna support this new project

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,960
and I get a blank stare well you are the

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,710
the of course is there whether or not

00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,630
it's spoken out loud so yes company

00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:08,350
people am I gonna get to hire to help me

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,020
support this new workload oh come on it

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,840
won't be that much work ooh sorry there

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,250
wasn't anything left in the budget or

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,720
you know some variation of the the team

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:22,330
player or good soldier speech but they

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,580
may be the only people who see that a

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,740
lot more effort is going to building new

00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,730
things than running the things they're

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,730
making money now

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,020
ask him if they've ever had their

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,450
training budget slashed or rejected out

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,730
of hand or maybe because another group

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,080
just used it all up before they even

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,690
heard there was one so they're still

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,220
describing sis admins they they probably

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,050
have a working knowledge of a half dozen

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,900
programming languages but they most

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,670
often think in shell they probably know

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,090
at least three ways of testing whether

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,580
our port is open and have a warm heart

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:04,510
spot in their heart for a handful of

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,340
UNIX Kommandant tools but they have no

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:09,490
patience for people who won't lift a

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,839
finger to help themselves they

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,970
may have participated in a DevOps

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,209
initiative that largely consists of team

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,920
team BRE name or they were helpfully

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,870
suggested to that they should install

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,200
some get some config management and

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:27,220
monitoring so we can do the DevOps now

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,399
or maybe so we can a July but when they

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,290
hear DevOps our agile what they think is

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,339
well let's take those same people who

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,959
can't hit a planned release cycle or

00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,779
even make whatever effort they need to

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:42,670
squeak by the change board requirements

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:46,330
let's give them unfettered access to

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:52,540
production because clearly I'm not paged

00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:53,890
often enough we're bringing a problem to

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,339
management or the engineering group

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,230
they're likely be told well but I'm

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:00,690
changing this would mean the engineers

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,200
have to do some work

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,640
can't you just deal with it and when you

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
when something like that has said what

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,940
they hear is well I think that group is

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,420
more important than you they're more

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:15,579
valuable than you so you knew this mean

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,820
was coming but it's so pervasive because

00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:20,620
the attitude is pervasive it's not

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,220
intentional but actions speak louder

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,350
than words and when you see all of these

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,300
things come together into they become

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,649
patterns and see if you don't start

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,360
turning cynical so how do you maintain

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,209
your sanity in the face of increasing

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,790
job scope increasing demand for velocity

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:43,570
and little hope for an effective

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,640
headcount no not to mention that you

00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,800
have to continue juggling the existing

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,390
volume of requests and just keep the

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:58,180
machine running please know I'm not

00:11:52,390 --> 00:12:00,370
saying just there's nothing just about

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,250
the situation there's nothing simple

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,310
about any of it and justice hasn't been

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,680
seen in a long time these changes are

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,270
difficult

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,980
they will take work and they will

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,000
require convincing other people and

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,770
other teams to have join in your cause

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,199
but first step towards getting help is

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,880
emitting that you have a problem the

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,060
problem probably isn't technical it's

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,320
almost entirely social

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,980
because the settlements have typically

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,480
been responsible for the environment and

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,670
the easiest way to ensure that things

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,230
don't change unexpectedly is to lock

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,510
everyone else out from it now

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,580
locking helped it helped with the goal

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,000
of keeping out unexpected changes but

00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,250
had a number of unfortunate side effects

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,890
first a kind of learned helplessness

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,740
sets in your customers and team waits

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,420
became so used to being hands-off that

00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,920
they don't know what a reasonable level

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,470
of effort is for any given request now

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,640
some teams settle on a pattern of

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,560
hands-off production but you have access

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,770
to staging but this is fraught with

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,020
peril really since people are

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,120
uncomfortable making Jenny changes all

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,880
changes end up being made by this as I'd

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,040
been still your time ends up being taken

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,570
up by performing lots of low value tasks

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,660
now the most common problem that stems

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,400
from this is configuration drift this is

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,400
when you have different settings in one

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,020
environment than the others but when the

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,210
cost to discover what production looks

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,790
like is high it's more likely that

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,400
people will either use defaults make

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,590
assumptions or guesses or use the same

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,090
configurations that work in their IDE so

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,140
you know the good old works on my

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:50,080
machine now this is a problem well solve

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,820
by config management or if you have a

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:58,720
stateless sorry static images it's well

00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,130
helped by that but you still need to be

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,550
willing to trust your peers and give

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,010
them access you want to be part of the

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,440
the process of validating changes you

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,480
could put in put in a pull request and

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,860
code review process that your

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,520
engineering peers are gonna be very

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,530
familiar with they're gonna be very

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,700
accustomed and comfortable with and it

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:24,160
helps them learn granting access to see

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,380
the existing configs and the ability to

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,360
propose changes also shares the

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,970
responsibility for your team's

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,700
environments and contributes to feelings

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,260
of ownership but denying your colleagues

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,270
the ability to

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,550
affected necessary config changes

00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,320
contributes still to the problem of

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,700
config drift and learned helplessness

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,030
you need to stop feeding the Machine

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,710
your value isn't doing the work but

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:58,240
being able to make the decision to have

00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:00,070
it done it now I'll be the first to say

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,290
that automating all the things is a

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,880
flawed goal it's usually said in the

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,600
context of a project rather than a

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,190
philosophy of continual improvement well

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,620
I agree that everything should be

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,440
automatic automated not everything

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,200
should be automatic decision-making is

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,290
complex and attempting to codify all the

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,050
possible decision trees it's a fantastic

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,470
way to make yourself insane break down

00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:29,650
to your steps automate certain pieces in

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,140
iterate over time now you shouldn't have

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,290
to engage in an automated automation

00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,580
project to improve your environment

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,470
build things and build time into your

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,150
schedule to solve a problem pick

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,120
something that happened this this week

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,940
or the sprint this month pick something

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,300
that's rough or manual but repeatable

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:53,170
and remove a small piece of friction and

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,590
then move on to the next one iterate and

00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,860
improve over time see an automation

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,690
project my dear friends is is ocean

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,710
boiling if I ever saw and I'm really

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,600
good at boiling oceans but ideally you

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,780
have time blocked out for continuous

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:15,580
improvement and if not create a meeting

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:17,410
or a weekly project to do so review the

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,940
results you know the issues that you've

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,530
experienced and pick something to

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:25,720
improve and just make it habit whatever

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,140
you don't automate must be documented

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,060
try to recognize whether you which which

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,280
provides more value writing

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:37,600
documentation or whether you'd be served

00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,360
by executable documentation ie code now

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,490
beyond the typical benefits of dots it

00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,570
also serves as functional requirements

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:51,000
for when it can be automated because

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,000
your documentation is up to date right

00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,030
we need to make sure that you and the

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:02,410
business also agree on why you're there

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,209
you should attempt to pick out part the

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,390
pieces of your work and attempt to

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,520
describe them way to make this a fun the

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,770
exercises try to use other job titles to

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,670
describe your roles you know code clerk

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,370
or release Ranger or are you an internet

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,660
plumber how much legacy system

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:25,240
spelunking do you have to do would you

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,329
describe part of your role as production

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,880
customs official are you the gateway to

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,700
production and if so are you actually

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,000
equipped to be able to do that here's a

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:42,160
quick test when you say no that can't go

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,280
do you get overridden more importantly

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:50,220
is this what you want to do before you

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,810
can ask for help you'll need to prepare

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,920
mostess admin teams don't have a healthy

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,400
relationship with the rest of the

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,370
business

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,850
so this assignments will have to

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:04,270
initiate the healing take somebody to

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,940
lunch ask questions and listen to the

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,250
answers this isn't the time to defend

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,930
yourself or your team it's time to fight

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,190
and find out what the business of

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,210
business views what you're doing now and

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,720
hear how things are working from

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,090
somebody else's perspective ask them

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,660
what they think your team's role is

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,310
towards achieving success ask what they

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,990
think your team does well and where

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:33,730
there are gaps between what you have now

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:36,040
in excellence you probably recognise the

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,110
words that they use but you need to go

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,590
out of your way to speak the same

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,720
language to communicate your message

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,560
you're gonna need them need to meet your

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,720
peers on their own turf now this might

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,510
seem terribly unfair why can't they meet

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,340
me on my terms but I'm guessing that

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:58,540
hasn't been working out so well for you

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,740
so far not only do you need to use their

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,630
language but you need to communicate

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,200
using their medium

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,700
it's probably not RC and writing an

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,850
email is a really great way to get

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,350
ignored but if you're speaking to

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,920
management be prepared to write to

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,140
presentation executives especially love

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,900
to see a slide deck it doesn't have to

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,040
be slick like this it probably shouldn't

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,930
have much in the way sounds or

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,570
transitions but a presentation can help

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:29,470
lay the groundwork groundwork for a real

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:32,140
conversation and now that you've

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,320
described your role we also need to

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:37,570
describe everything that you support

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,670
it's entirely possible and likely even

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,050
that the people and teens that you

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,260
support don't actually know what you're

00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:47,620
responsible for it could be argued that

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,270
they shouldn't need to know but if

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,530
you've been saying no to protect

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,570
yourself it's a sign that you're

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:57,010
significantly overextended do you need

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,050
to have a real discussion with your

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,410
leadership about your role your scope

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,870
and your staffing in order to have this

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,040
discussion you need to prepare you need

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,140
to come up with a fairly comprehensive

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,380
list of the products and teams that you

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,140
support this is a list of every team and

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,870
all of their products the components and

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,240
tasks that belong to you for each of

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,430
them and don't forget all the components

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,650
that in most companies nobody seems to

00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:28,410
own but somehow people come to you to

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:31,720
implement or fix ci source control

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,160
project managing tools wiki's these all

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,830
seem to be very common examples of

00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,570
things that just suddenly happen in the

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,590
environment and are now business

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,360
critical but nobody really owned but

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,730
what about are you also responsible for

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,370
word directory services or the

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,560
virtualization platform you know in

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,710
small to midsize companies you might

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,970
also have the mail or chat phones you

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,500
might even do like workstation

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:01,360
purchasing provisioning printers but

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,340
seriously like when you figure out your

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,710
responsibilities get into detail this

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:12,940
isn't the time to skimp every app here's

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,510
the thing your leadership might not know

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,850
what LDAP is

00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,680
but they'll understand if nobody can log

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,110
into their machines or they can't pull

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:27,140
information to build reports and by the

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:28,700
way no code deploys can happen are you

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,840
in fact sure that you know your

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,810
company's goals are

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,380
would your c-suite executives agree with

00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,310
your take on it what do you need to

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,970
succeed

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,620
how much more staff do you need what

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:46,370
tooling or equipment would help you to

00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:49,220
be more effective and most importantly

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,660
are your incentives aligned with aligned

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:55,160
with your goals do your incentives

00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,820
aligned or conflict with those of other

00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,260
groups now in order have any meaningful

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,390
discussion with people in your company

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,610
who aren't necessarily technical you

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:08,690
need to be able to relate in a language

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,700
that they speak now regardless of team

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,610
duties the lingua franca of most teams

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,340
is money as engineers most of us prefer

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,490
to think in terms of the tech itself but

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:24,830
in order to describe an impact everybody

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:27,140
can translate to money it's difficult

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,690
and uncomfortable habit to get into but

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,330
it's really helpful I encourage you to

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,070
consider the components of components of

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,800
costs that go into every incident or

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:39,650
task what's the cost of a main site

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:43,160
outage or the cost of this particular

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,780
feature not being available and is money

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,280
and effort being put into things that

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,700
matter further show how systems relate

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,710
it doesn't have to be terribly detailed

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:58,220
describe the features that the customers

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,880
use or R'lyeh on X Y & Z pieces of

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,880
infrastructure

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,850
you have to be able to explain why why

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,460
this why you have to do this particular

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:16,299
piece of maintenance explain what the

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,730
cost is if this piece breaks how much

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:21,460
would it cost to invest in improving the

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:25,049
automation around it including

00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,049
delegation and self-service tools

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,009
describe how well how doing this

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,769
maintenance reduces your context

00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:37,269
switching unplanned outages and the lost

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:38,889
reputation of your company how can you

00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:42,850
delegate more work to your peers and

00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:47,259
what benefits can come from your peers

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,110
increase agency and what do you need to

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:53,080
do to achieve the implementation of

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,509
those enabling technologies draw the

00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,659
lines from your LDAP to your storage to

00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:01,210
your CI tool to code testing and getting

00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:03,250
artifacts deployed to production then

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,210
show all the other similar systems that

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:09,669
have similar dependencies now once the

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,340
picture starts emerging showing how

00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:15,220
everything is raw everything is reliant

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,440
on really unexcited things like LDAP and

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,690
your storage cluster and that Genki

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,870
collection of angry shell and Perl

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,960
scripts that keep everything working

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,460
realization is going to start to dawn

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,049
congratulations you've just effectively

00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,460
communicated value now if your company

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,009
claims that they're doing agile but they

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,039
can't do continuous delivery they're not

00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:41,580
really agile the whole point of that

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,769
framework is to improve the delivery of

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:51,340
a value to the customer and the business

00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:53,169
that's that's where your gaps are now

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,960
it's not DevOps talk unless we talk

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,210
about have some Conway's law now when

00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,779
people read this they usually think of

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,580
an org chart you see how smooth and

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,929
linear those lines are almost how much

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,370
sense they make this can help this this

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:11,889
helps people to have understand the

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,679
context when an organization it starts

00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:16,779
to exceed Dunbar's number but don't

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,509
confuse a reporting structure with a

00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:22,229
communication structure

00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:23,639
it's the communications that are key now

00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,129
if you don't know about Conway's law

00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:29,940
you'll be at the mercy of people who

00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:31,379
care about the org chart but if you and

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,479
your people have those regular

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,190
communications with people outside of

00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:38,959
your reporting structure those

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:42,119
themselves are communication structures

00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:45,119
lunches and friendships are way more

00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:49,739
effective than status meetings go

00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:52,619
pollinate I firmly believe that the key

00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:55,529
to making business work better and the

00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:59,639
improve the lives of your operations is

00:25:55,529 --> 00:26:01,289
the pager are the sysadmin z' held

00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:05,009
responsible for apps written by other

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:09,029
people who gets paged when the app goes

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:11,659
down if it is your systems folks how

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:14,039
does that even make sense

00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:14,659
get your developers on call for their

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,749
apps

00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:20,999
sassette bans should be escalated to see

00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:22,739
developers can triage and troubleshoot

00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:26,429
their own apps more readily than ops

00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:27,749
because they wrote it and if you call

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,059
yourself a full stack developer

00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:36,329
excellent you have no excuse to not

00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:38,219
carry a pager but the developers they

00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:40,229
don't have a background in in operations

00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:42,629
but they do get to call in the cavalry

00:26:40,229 --> 00:26:44,519
when they get stuck they don't need to

00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:46,609
know everything about every system and

00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,419
they don't need to resolve everything

00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:53,659
when a fault occurs and they need help

00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:57,109
they pair with the systems folks as a

00:26:53,659 --> 00:27:01,139
diagnosed troubleshoot and resolve that

00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:03,659
way they don't need to escalate the next

00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:07,190
time this thing breaks or they can

00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:13,169
collaborate on a more permanent fix stop

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:15,509
listen and collaborate see when teams

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:17,759
aren't responsible for the products when

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,369
they aren't paged when it fails they're

00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,929
numb to the pain that they inflict

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:24,389
they're not trying to cause pain they

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:27,749
just don't feel it they don't suffer the

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:30,029
consequences it's especially easy to

00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:31,309
argue for the cities that proclaim they

00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:33,769
are using

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:37,309
again if that they claim they want

00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:39,830
continuous feedback there is no no

00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:42,370
feedback more visceral than being waken

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:45,049
up by a pager in the middle of the night

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,769
it's almost inevitable that we'll hear

00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:50,090
well we can't interrupt our developers

00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:54,529
as if it makes sense to interrupt

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:57,259
somebody else B even being aware of the

00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:00,230
pain saying hearing how many times I was

00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,759
paged last night can elicit sympathy but

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,909
that's a far cry from the experience of

00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:09,110
being paged yourself here's another

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:10,820
thing I know you don't want to be woken

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,639
up at 3:00 a.m. because of something you

00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,129
wrote well how do you think your ops

00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:20,960
team feels about being woken up because

00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:22,999
of something they didn't write this is

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,059
what that list of responsibilities we

00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,710
were talking about earlier is for asking

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:29,809
each team to take responsibility for

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,850
their own products you're still likely

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:35,809
to have a hefty list of services that

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:37,909
you provide that you are on call for now

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:41,029
as you're pulling all this information

00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:44,840
together now's the time to point out

00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:47,360
those staffing numbers this may seem

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,369
this may be a matter of the places that

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,220
I've worked I've never seen a developer

00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:55,070
to operations ratio lower than five to

00:28:52,220 --> 00:29:00,169
one in most places it's much higher it's

00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:01,429
usually somewhere around ten to one by

00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:04,220
adding these teams to their own paid

00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:05,929
rotations they drastically reduce the

00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,929
load and burnout potential on the ops

00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:10,820
folks by not adding them to put into

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:14,919
their own pager rotations they're

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,419
complicit in the burnout of ops folks

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:20,809
now sediments have a reputation for

00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:22,460
saying now the people who are asking are

00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,860
probably not trying to make your more

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,419
your life worse they're just trying to

00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:31,610
get their work done they may not even

00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,249
know what their what their simple

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:37,429
request involves or that it might not

00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:39,940
even be necessary but by not having

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:42,470
responsibilities aligned with authority

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,120
you may have been stuck with the pain of

00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,820
of

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,770
people's wishes you know that fulfilling

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,430
the request is gonna cause you pain

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:53,830
so you understandably say no but what

00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,630
happens next is that they escalate until

00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,090
they hit somebody sufficiently important

00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,620
enough to override you and this is the

00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,360
basis for wise two-sentence feel

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,970
steamrolled by everybody else and

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,940
everybody else feels held hostage by sis

00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:14,440
admins all hope is not lost fiercest

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,679
admin stop saying no take a cue from

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,660
improv comedy nothing kills in improv

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:24,910
groups flow more than somebody

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:27,429
responding with no they say yes and now

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:31,210
since that doesn't really make make

00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:37,300
sense in the sysadmin context we change

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:40,870
that say yes but yes but is a very

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,040
powerful thing it can be used to get you

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,510
help yes I can set that up for you but

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,440
we don't have the capacity to run it for

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:52,510
you will happen there you agreed that

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,059
the requestors respe is reasonable and

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:58,179
you set expectations to the level

00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:00,190
support they you can give you left the

00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:04,179
requester with several options to

00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:07,770
continue the conversation they might

00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:10,030
have a hiring rec that they can't fill

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:12,130
perhaps some of their engineers join

00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,110
your team as part of a rotation or a

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,670
lateral move

00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,929
they'll need mentorship and training but

00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,450
this kind of cross training is

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:24,460
invaluable it's a force multiplier and

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:26,850
it sets precedent so maybe maybe these

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:31,300
people take responsibility for the thing

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,640
they run it they get paid for it and of

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,950
course you'll probably have to be an

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,190
escalation point still to help them when

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:43,990
it fails but it's their product again

00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:45,790
this helps set precedent see most

00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,309
Simmons are stuck doing tests that that

00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:51,370
that provide very little value because

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:53,679
they restrict access to their peers to

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,210
my mind there's a one really perfect

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,350
example and that's called why I call

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,320
playing telephone

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,960
and when I say that I mean the situation

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,630
where somebody let let's say let's say a

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,600
developer they need some logs but they

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,100
don't have access to the box so you

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,730
fetch the log request to him give it to

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,039
them no not that log this log hmm you

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,720
you fetch that no I'm not seeing what

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,030
I'm what I'm looking for could you check

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,620
could you check over here for something

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:25,900
else and so on and so on now I don't

00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,450
know what you're trying to to prevent by

00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,340
restricting access but if this scenario

00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,640
ever happens to you you should know that

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,679
you're providing negative value again

00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,289
let's remember that these are your peers

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,960
and they are not out to get you and they

00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:44,159
can probably trust it to be reasonable

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,260
human beings if you meet them halfway

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,179
with that framework in mind it's time to

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:54,520
demonstrate some trust and delegate to

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:56,669
them give them access your value is not

00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,720
in the login credentials that you have

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:03,159
otherwise you're just a poorly

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,020
implemented terminal as a service even

00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,900
better than giving direct access is

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,030
tooling logging into a server should be

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,549
an a/d anti-pattern for most work and

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,970
some modern infrastructures actively

00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:18,429
discourage it you need better tooling so

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:22,809
with the example logging let's talk

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:25,299
tooling first logging into boxes to get

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:27,419
logs is just dumb it's sure you could

00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:30,059
wrap a tail command into a run deck job

00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:32,740
but let's centralize those logs instead

00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:35,980
now syslog is better than nothing but

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,640
not by much shipping logs is easy but

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:43,720
consuming them as something useful isn't

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,100
you know batteries are not included if

00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,320
your company wants to spend the money on

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,190
Splunk that encourage that spunk is

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,980
pretty fantastic it's gonna be expensive

00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,200
so if you're not gonna spend enough to

00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,909
use it for everything there's gonna be

00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,450
confusion as to what's in there and

00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:05,250
what's stored elsewhere I encourage you

00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:07,690
to go all or nothing on this elk

00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,280
elasticsearch log stash and Cabana is a

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,460
great middle ground

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,940
ELQ is free as a beer and is very

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,350
feature full but if you don't want to

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,929
run it yourself there plenty ELQ as a

00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:24,010
service company cloudy Elk in the cloud

00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:26,830
providers my company data dog happens to

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,950
be running in such a service now so ask

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,320
me anything

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:34,810
but regardless take your centralized

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,140
logging tool of choice provide your

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:41,050
customers your peers with the URL and

00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,909
credentials and send them links and how

00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:46,450
to use documentation and get out of

00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:50,050
their way one tip that I can give you is

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,000
that you should have ship every

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,100
application that you can export their

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,840
logs in JSON format just right off the

00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,280
bat because if you don't you're gonna

00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,540
have to write something along the lines

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,670
of a grok filter and they're not any fun

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,010
now this is an example implementation

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,220
for my history where we defined a log

00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:13,240
provider for applications it's a right

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,070
there on screen but if somebody's being

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,400
stubborn about changing their log type

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,050
than fine no it's fine really

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,250
they can write that ROC filter

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:26,250
themselves it's 500 characters of regex

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,840
look you don't need to run all the

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,580
things if someone asks you to run this

00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,190
command for me you need to put a button

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,110
on it

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,660
run deck is again a fantastic tool for

00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,700
putting a button on it it's pretty easy

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,100
to make high availability you tie it

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,590
into LDAP for credentials manage

00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:50,470
permissions and by long shipping its

00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:54,010
logs so it ended there you get auditing

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,990
of who did what and when if you have

00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,760
some data that must be restricted try to

00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,450
isolate those cases from the rest of

00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,890
your environment

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,200
you shouldn't have to restrict

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:08,080
everything just because one thing does

00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,880
need isolation so we have to ask why

00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,300
would you have to deploy other people's

00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,870
code if you're sidin are you providing

00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,100
any value in that activity

00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,560
because if the deployment doesn't go

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,650
well well you're launching right into a

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,029
game of another game of telephone

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:29,539
what if you make it easy for the product

00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:31,609
team to do it empower them with trust

00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:35,329
and tooling and make it easy for them to

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:37,759
do the right thing look give them

00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:41,689
tooling see if their deploys actually

00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:44,019
succeeded now logs are start but metric

00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:46,549
dashboards that show changes in

00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:49,339
performance conditions and error rates

00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:55,729
make it really easy to see what's going

00:36:49,339 --> 00:37:01,400
on sorry I live in Orlando so everywhere

00:36:55,729 --> 00:37:03,410
I travel is dry in comparison but this

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,289
freedom that you give your peers doesn't

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,939
come free providing tooling doesn't

00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:10,339
absolve the development teams of the

00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:12,099
need to communicate in fact it's likely

00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:14,329
they're gonna have to communicate more

00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:17,479
they're gonna need to be watching those

00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:19,489
dashboards and logs to see for them to

00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:24,410
see for themselves the success of every

00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:26,479
deployment now I say they in this

00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:29,029
article a lot and that's because by

00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:31,630
default most organizations are set up to

00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:34,519
have a strong us versus them culture

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:36,609
it's only natural for there to be an us

00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:40,099
and to them

00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:42,709
well it may not be my job to do a given

00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:46,429
thing it is our job to ensure that the

00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:47,539
team and company are successful now

00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:49,400
while that sounds like some

00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:52,699
happy-go-lucky tree-hugging pop

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,549
psychology nonsense and it kinda is the

00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:58,519
goal here is to get you the beleaguered

00:37:55,549 --> 00:38:00,259
sus admins the help that you need to

00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:04,099
improve the capabilities of the business

00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:08,599
and to have a better life now if I may

00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:10,880
be permitted one final thing the

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,759
psychological damage done to society by

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,239
their peers can make make us seem bitter

00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:19,759
and cynical so I encourage my people to

00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:23,029
try to see that they aren't trying to

00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:25,189
make life difficult for you it's very

00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:29,089
likely that responsibility and authority

00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:31,279
are misaligned i likewise encourage my

00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:34,759
peers to try to take steps to make their

00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:37,239
lives better and it may seem like the

00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:39,529
onus here is on the part of the

00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,390
they're helping to keep the plate

00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:44,689
spinning and much of the work described

00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:48,559
on them here is on them and that's a

00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:51,109
fair point Weesa sad bins have to put in

00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,589
the effort to make a make a life better

00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:56,630
for ourselves because the way we've been

00:38:54,589 --> 00:39:00,349
working clearly hasn't been working out

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,269
for us there's so much more to this

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,059
topic particularly in the shift away

00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:07,819
from from a systems team to supporting a

00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:11,979
bunch of project to a bunch of product

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,979
teams that are largely self-sustaining

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:20,390
also a lot of companies what they really

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,949
want as a pass but given the option you

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,989
know your systems team is gonna go out

00:39:21,949 --> 00:39:25,969
of the good go out of their way to

00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:28,069
provide the most half-assed paths that

00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:30,259
they can build not because they want to

00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:33,259
be half-assed but because they don't

00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:34,400
they want to build it themselves but

00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:38,930
these things are gonna have to wait for

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,819
another day so when somebody says DevOps

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,819
doesn't work

00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:47,749
they're absolutely correct DevOps is a

00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:49,309
concept philosophy it's a professional

00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:52,549
movement based on trust and

00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:55,279
collaboration among teams to align them

00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:57,799
to business goals but a concept doesn't

00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:03,650
do work and a philosophy doesn't meet

00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:06,229
goals people do please remember just

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:10,939
like Soylent Green DevOps is made of

00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:13,670
people now I'd like to take a moment to

00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:16,269
thank my editor Sean Moulton for his

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,069
help on the work in the original article

00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:21,949
our conference organizers who've done a

00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:24,380
fantastic job and the DevOps community

00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:28,369
at large thank you for being so

00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:31,609
welcoming and sharing and supportive now

00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:35,059
as your speaker I advise you to take one

00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:41,259
antagonist one company credit card and

00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:41,259
two lunches let's go plant some trees

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,080
thank you very much I'd love for you to

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,060
provide feedback by that via the

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,240
conference app and if you'd like a

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:56,640
sticker please come find me later

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,640
