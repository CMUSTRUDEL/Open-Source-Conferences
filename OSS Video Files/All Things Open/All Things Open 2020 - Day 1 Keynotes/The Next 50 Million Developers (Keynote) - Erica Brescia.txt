Abstract: We all rely on the ever-growing body of open source software that serves as the building blocks powering much of the modern world. In order to support this continued growth — both to maintain the software we already have and create the software of the future — the Open Source community will double in size in the next five years. Erica Brescia, chief operating officer at GitHub, will share insight into the incredible growth and global expansion occurring in Open Source, and the evolution that is necessary to attract the talent and potential of the next 50 million developers.
