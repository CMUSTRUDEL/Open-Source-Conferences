Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: Working openly can lead to unparalleled success—and not just for software projects. Values and ideas derived from open source communities are changing the ways we work, manage, and lead in industries across the globe—and the Open Organization community is exploring just how that’s happening.

In this session, attendees will learn more about the community and its mission to translate open source values and development best practices into techniques any organization can embrace to become more agile, innovative, and accountable.

Members of the open organization community will offer an overview of community-produced resources—definitions, models, articles, and books—and offer several practices your organization can begin implementing immediately as it works to become more open. They’ll also learn how to join the project—and, most importantly, how to contribute to its growing (open) library of materials.

the resources available how to find them

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,720
how to use them and more importantly how

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,760

learn in just a few minutes and i've

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
personally been supporting the project

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,719
since 2015

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,399
and in fact i think that's a good place

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,000
for us to start uh just to give you a

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,199
little bit of a history of our project

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,239
so you can see how best you can

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,640
contribute

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,559
i'll take us back to 2015 and provide a

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
little bit of that a little bit of that

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,880
context

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,320
um in the in the very beginning

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
uh there was a book or rather i guess i

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
should say there was an organization and

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,799
that organization was

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
is red hat and jim whitehurst who was

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
then the ceo

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
of red hat wrote a book about it and

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,479
that book is the open organization

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
igniting

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
passion and performance and that book

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,200
was released by harvard business review

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,079
press

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,560
in 2015 and the book really describes

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,600
how

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,560
principles uh like transparency

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
authenticity meritocracy right uh in

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
short like

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
you know these principles that we

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,640
associate with openness really could

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
spin out of open source communities or

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,119
could could form the foundation

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
of organizations uh business

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,119
organizations or any organization

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,000
non-profits

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,920
in the face of changing work conditions

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
and changing lives

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
right how can uh the same principles and

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
practices that power some of the world's

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
most

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,920
innovative communities open source

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
communities how can they be the bedrock

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,599
of uh organizational culture in any

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,959
context right

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,520
um and that book was released in uh 2015

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
as i said and in the epilogue of that

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
book uh

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,599
jim whitehurst issued an invitation

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
to anyone reading he said you know go

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
and share your thoughts

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
and opinions on a certain page uh

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,360
situated on opensource.com

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
which is a place uh that i recommend you

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,239
check out if you're not familiar with

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
opensource.com i've worked on

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,879
opensource.com

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,840
since 2010 at red hat and so people did

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
you know reading jim's book they went to

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,440
opensource.com to continue the

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
conversation

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
about the ways that open principles are

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
changing the way we work

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
and we manage and we lead today right

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,200
the way we build organizational cultures

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,120
and eventually that conversation outgrew

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,239
a single book about a single company

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
right one book about

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
red hat and participation in the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,319
community kept increasing

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
and we began creating content in the

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,440
form of books

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
articles uh definitions all different

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,920
kinds of things which you'll learn about

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
today

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,200
all designed to really continue the

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,640
conversation that the open organization

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,800
started exploring how open is it uh

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
organizations of all kinds could become

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
more open

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,959
and ultimately um an upstream

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
community formed around the ideas in

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
this book right an

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
open source project really focused on

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
exploring

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,560
open principles at work in organizations

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
all over the world red hat continues to

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,480
support that community

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
uh providing critical funding uh and

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
infrastructure for the project and the

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,200
conversation that it continues to foster

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
so

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,080
um that upstream community continues

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,640
continues to do some fantastic work

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
today

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,920
uh and it's still growing uh we are an

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,239
upstream

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,319
knowledge sharing community committed to

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,519
exploring how open principles change the

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
ways we work

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
manage and lead we're going to talk a

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,760
little bit about what that involves

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
with the rest of our time today

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
according to our most

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
recent community survey and audience

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,080
survey

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
these are the most common ways that

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,120
participants identify themselves right

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
it architect

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
developer but you will also see some

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,519
other uh identifications here that i

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
think are really interesting in our

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,840
community makeup right

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,600
people managers right ceos and project

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
leads right folks that are interested in

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
the people and process

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
side of open source you might even say

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,240
the uh the people

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
of open source right um the

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
the folks that are interested in the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
ways open principles can be

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
leveraged to tackle um people in process

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
issues in organizations not just

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639
technical ones

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
and as the community continued to grow

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,960
right as

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,400
we just learned in our previous

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,720
presentation you're always going to have

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,639
a sort of core contributor group right

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
and our group of core contributors are

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
called the open organization ambassadors

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
these are folks

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,479
that have uh demonstrated routine uh

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
stellar commitments to the community

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,160
helping uh

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
set the direction for the project uh in

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,280
a post-book

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,000
world right and continue to establish it

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,479
its priorities set its agenda etc

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
um people become ambassadors in all

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
sorts of ways but

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,560
everyone joins the group by

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
demonstrating that kind of you know

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
sustained valuable commitments to the

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,919
group whether it's writing

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
speaking maintaining resources

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,960
recruiting other people to

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
the community uh and so on um and and

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,600
one of those folks

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,360
uh is my partner today jimmy shulin

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,800
who is an open organization ambassador

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
has been working in the community for

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
a long time so i'd like to turn it over

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,639
to him uh to tell you a little bit more

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,199
about the community itself

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
uh how we work what he has gotten out of

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
uh participating and

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
some of the resources that that we've

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
created so jimmy i'll hand it back over

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
to you

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
yeah so that was a bit about the

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
community and like i said we operate

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,000
like many other upstream

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,039
open source communities as you will see

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,600
but we are largely a non-technical group

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,560
we create and share knowledge in as

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,120
others communities create and share code

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,160
so but what does that mean exactly what

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
does it look like

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,560
so let's take a look at some of the

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,520
resources that we've been saying

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
the first one is foundational after all

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,639
we're the

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
open organization community but what do

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,520
we mean when we talk about

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,680
open organizations what do others mean

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
as the community form the ambassador

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,400
huddle together and create

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
the open organization definition from

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,120
the discussions and material

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,000
available including our own research and

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
interviews

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
with leaders across the world the

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
definition

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,639
as everything else is open for all to

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
suggest changes and amendments

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,759
and what the ambassadors identify was

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
five characteristics that serve

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,599
as the basic conditions for openness in

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,919
most contexts

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,680
the definition goes into more detail

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,800
than we have time for here today

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,759
but we also maintain a maturity model

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,800
so people can assess how open they and

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
their teams are

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,039
according to the principles outlined

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,000
here

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,599
following the definition are several

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
books that we put together

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,840
as we were born from a book more or less

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
it makes sense for us to continue that

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,759
tradition

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,960
but this isn't an unusual sort of book

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,280
series we write

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
develop and maintain in a truly open and

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
collaborative

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479
way we have a series of core volumes

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
that includes a workbook

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
which contains both inspirational

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,919
chapters as well as hands-on exercises

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
that you can use

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,039
at your workplace or in your community

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,319
and then a manual specifically for

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,840
leaders the leaders

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,879
manual even has two editions available

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,680
we also maintain a series of guides to

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
specific contexts like the it culture

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
and education

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
and now another volume is in development

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,800
and on the way

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,879
it will cover how to use open principles

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,520
and practices to enhance distributed

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
remote

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,960
teamwork we hope it will be ready for

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
release by the end of the year

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
we were saying that we are advocates for

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
open principles and practices in

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
organizations but what does that

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
actually look like

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,199
so far we covered the principles as part

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,360
of the open organization definition

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
how do we turn those principles into

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
practices

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,279
and here are some examples you can bring

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,000
with you already today

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,320
our first example is an exercise in how

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,279
to

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,719
open up your decision making opening up

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,959
processes and making them more

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,000
transparent builds your credibility

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,320
and enhances trust with team members

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,920
it forces you to walk the transparency

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
walk in ways

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,240
that might challenge your assumptions or

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
even comfort level

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
working this way does create additional

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,040
work particularly at the beginning

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,440
of the process but ultimately this works

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
well for holding managers accountable to

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,519
team members

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,040
and it creates more consistency and once

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
you are ready to start

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
the new improved process or way of

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
working

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,920
everyone is already on board they are

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
familiar with the changes and the

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,600
implementation will then go much

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,720
faster so this exercise is

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
it includes four phases you pick a

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
process

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,320
you gather feedback which includes

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,399
revising and iterating on the process

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
you implement and last but not least

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,080
reflection of

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,360
some time has passed how did it go is it

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
more transparent

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,480
is it more effective do you need to

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,040
change or improve something

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,000
now this and many this exercise and many

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,720
more

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
are available in the workbook this book

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
is organized by the principles

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,480
that you saw on the previous slide with

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,360
several chapters in each

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,920
each section on the topic of making open

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,560
decision i often also talk about making

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,399
all work visible which is also the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,279
essence of the chapter that i wrote for

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,279
this book

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,279
which you can find under collaboration

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
inclusivity is a major building block

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,560
for openness in your team

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
project or organization and i find it

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
really hard

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
which is why our next recommendation for

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,880
today is to do a privileged work

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,800
exercise with your team this exercise

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
could be a bit tricky to perform in a

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
remote coverage safe

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,040
scenario but it's very powerful if you

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,200
have the opportunity to gather

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,120
in a large room and you will need a

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
large room as you will move around

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,160
physically during the exercise and some

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,160
more than others

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
the first step is to explain to the

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
group that we all have certain

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,800
privileges others have not had

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
and sometimes we don't even notice

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,720
privileges because they are so ingrained

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
in our culture

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
in step two everyone gathers in the one

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
line

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
at one end of the room you will then

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,839
read statements

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,760
which are included in the book and

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,760
depending on if that statement applies

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,760
to the participants they take a step

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,519
forward or sometimes backwards

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,279
explain that if some statement feels

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,920
uncomfortable admitting

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,880
to you just stand still and wait for the

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,800
next statement no one has to move

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,480
and once all statements have been read

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
you most likely have ended up in

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,000
different places in the room

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,160
take a look around then move over to the

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,920
reflection part of the exercise where

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,079
you can have quite insightful and

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,040
productive conversations on what just

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,120
happened

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:46,240
and why

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
over to brian then

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
great thanks a lot jimmy so that's just

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,480
two examples of some of the practices

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,160
uh that our community uh puts together

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,680
and maintains resources for

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,639
helping teams work more openly and

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,000
understand

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,399
openness a little bit better we welcome

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,800
participation of all kinds and this

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
is our invitation to you to everyone

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,639
here watching

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
uh please consider joining the project

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,920
and contributing

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
um these are just a few of the ways

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
right you can

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
read and share our work with others in

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,880
your in your social circle

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,920
theopenorganization.org

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,839
you can connect with the community

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,000
online if you have questions

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
about open principles in general or if

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,279
you have a specific organizational

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
problem that you yourself are

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,200
are trying to address we love

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,680
challenging questions in this community

who are really

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
insinuating open uh processes and

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
principles

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
inside their their organization so if

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,360
you've got a great interview we publish

opensource.com as well

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
maybe you like to write longer pieces

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
right in that case

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
you know as jimmy mentioned uh all our

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
books are

licensed so you can

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
read them review them see what's missing

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,160
and propose a chapter

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,760
right if something is not in the book

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
that you think it should cover and you

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
can write the chapter please feel free

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,760
to pitch a chapter

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,600
um all those books are available on

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,639
github and you can get started

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,000
uh at the url here to uh to to check us

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,199
out and file an issue whether that

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,440
issue's about

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,760
a typo you found or the issue is about a

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,079
chapter that you think needs to be added

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
and of course always always always like

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,160
any open source project we always need

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,839
help translating and localizing our

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
materials right we

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,440
have a really great international

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
community

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
and but we can always use more folks

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
from different regions all over the

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
world

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,279
trying to help us localize materials for

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,880
different contexts

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,040
we really do think that our materials

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
are are useful in a variety of global

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
contexts but they're only as useful as

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,399
people are able to engage with them

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,120
right so we need some help translating

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,800
um so you'll find us in all the places

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,160

organizations so thank you very much

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
well thank you jimmy and brian i think

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,040
we still technically have a few minutes

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,279
left on the clock

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,199
before the close of the session so i

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,279
encourage any of the attendees to put

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,759
questions in the qa or in the chat we

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,600
are

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,360
we'll hang around until the close of the

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,399
session so please let us know if you

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
have questions but

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,600
thank you so much brian and jimmy for

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,720
that talk it was very inspiring learning

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,880
about this project and organization

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,560
i have a personal interest in this topic

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,800
i spent the first half of my career

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,480
studying how to build technology systems

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
as a forester analyst and now

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
working in open source it's more about

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
how we build and how we come together

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,199
and figure out how to work

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,880
in in the style and this open

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,959
organizational model so

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
really interesting to hear how different

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
groups like this project are coming

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
together to help provide more clarity

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
and definition of what that model looks

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
like so

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,160
thank you so much for sharing that with

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
us

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
looks like we have a question in the

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,680
chat

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,839
do brian and jimmy want to take one of

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
these

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
well let me take a look i have to pull

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,839
up the the chat do we jimmy do you see

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,839
it

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,680
oh here we go uh the question is comes

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
from alex

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,959
um how are you able to

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
avoid the privilege walk exercise from

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
turning into something like a corny

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
corporate team building exercise

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,519
because it's clearly an important topic

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,959
and so you want to give it you know you

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,440
don't want to give it short shrift which

00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,120
you know

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
i appreciate that that question alex as

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
jimmy already wrote um

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
it's about bringing it up in the right

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
context right so not just kind of

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
tacking it on

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,039
uh to something else giving it the the

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,439
weight in the uh

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,439
the the spotlight that it deserves uh

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,480
and and really it's about facilitation

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,640
right um the facilitator is key to

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
making it the experience valuable to

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,240
everyone which is why

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,240
in the open organization workbook we

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,079
don't just describe like what the ideal

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,400
scenario would look like but

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,400
we offer all the resources that one

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
would need to run the exercise from

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
start to finish

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,160
along with some example sort of almost

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,840
pre-scripted remarks to kind of give you

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,520
a sense of things you can say to keep

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,320
the activity moving

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,400
uh and to respond to people's questions

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
uh open organization ambassador

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
laura hilliger of greenpeace wrote that

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,520
exercise she maintains that exercise for

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,120
the community

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,559
you can read more about it in the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,400
workbook you can read more about it at

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,160
opensource.com and you can also reach

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
out to our ambassador who

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
loves to run the exercise has tons of

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
experience running it and i can

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
guarantee there's nothing corny about

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,440
the way

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,000
that uh she runs it uh so if you want

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
a real expert uh opinion on running it

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,280
that's not mine

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,280
uh laura's the person to see

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,679
yeah and i'm not sure why i started

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,200
typing instead of just talking

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,400
but yeah i i agree it could be

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,039
very awkward if it's a either new group

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,880
or

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,960
two larger contexts where people don't

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
know each other then that's a bit

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
you need to read the room before

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,960
bringing up something

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
like this but then again as we pointed

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,280
out it's

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,520
no one has to move you don't need to

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,520
push someone if not you should move or

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,919
something it's uh

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
clearly it's sensitive and that's why i

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,559
also mentioned

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,480
i think this is really really hard i

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,000
mean i'm a middle-aged

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,760
white guy in sweden it's uh i have

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,720
so many privileges probably

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
i don't even recognize so i think it's a

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,960
really eye-opening

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:11,840
exercise to do but you need trust

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,840
between the people of course

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,960
thank you alex for the question we still

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
have five minutes

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
and if we have nothing coming through i

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,919
don't know how jimmy and brian feel

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,360
about sticking around for five more

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,360
minutes but i'll i'll be here

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,160
happy to yeah we deliberately wanted to

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,200
leave time for questions uh so we could

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
do some q a so

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
happy to to hang around if folks have

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,000
extra things they'd like to ask

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
great thank you

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
i have a non-serious question i'm really

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,840
curious if jimmy's

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,080
curtain background is a real curtain or

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,840
is that a projection

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,400
i'm not actually in the office in some

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,720
of the

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
video conferencing rooms because of the

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
audio and visual

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,360
so it's that's why i'm here today

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
otherwise we're

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,880
mostly working remotely nowadays

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,240
it's nice it's like a studio service now

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
instead of the office service

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
it is a good it's a great segue though

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
if while folks

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
uh you know tabulate their questions

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
i'll just

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
plug one more time the book that jimmy

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,600
mentioned that our community is putting

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,039
together right now so if you're

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,559
interested in the way we make books as

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
an open source community

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,080
i encourage you to come to github and

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,520
our github organization and check out

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,360
our newest book

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,039
which is the open organization guide to

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,200
distributed teamwork you know as jimmy

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,280
mentioned and others are experiencing

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
uh you know teams are working remotely

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,720
under conditions that some folks have

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,760
never worked in before given the global

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,960
pandemic

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,400
um and uh you know as a community when

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,919
when this started to occur we kind of

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,799
got together and said well what can we

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,559
offer to the

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,799
the conversation right and we kind of

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,320
said well you know in some cases

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,919
open source communities have been

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
working the way that everybody's being

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,760
asked to work you know fully distributed

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,559
remote globally aware

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,520
for decades in some cases and so what

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,200
lessons from

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,200
open source communities and open source

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,159
projects can translate

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
into best practices for any organization

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
perhaps if your organization is

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,039
is working openly and just in a

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,919
distributed in a remote way for the

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,720
first time

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,799
how can open principles and practices

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,679
smooth that transition

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,200
and how can working openly really make

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,039
your team much more effective

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,120
in working in under those conditions and

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,840
so we've got some great chapters

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
uh already in production uh the book is

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,360
really turning out well jimmy of course

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,120
has a great chapter in there too about

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,360
sharing and visualizing work

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,919
uh and i encourage you to check it out

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,200
uh on github uh visit us and and propose

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
your own chapter if you or your

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
organization has had an interesting

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,240
experience

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,799
uh please uh please join and and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,799
contribute it

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
thanks brian i definitely feel that

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,600
constant distribution now

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,840
everything ever all the way that we are

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,240
working is virtually and distributed

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,080
and there i know that this is

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,840
not maybe more or less natural to those

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,360
that are already engaged but i think we

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,880
can all learn from that in the corporate

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,520
space as well

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,679
at least i know i work at google and we

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,720
are pretty good and enablement of work

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
from home but

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
there's still that lack of community and

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,360
connection that i think we've

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,880
had to try to recreate virtually which

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
has been an interesting discovery

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,240
process so i think

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,440
we can learn a lot from how we were able

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,080
to

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,679
organically help with community and

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,520
connection and these virtual channels

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,880
already established an open source so i

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,400
think that's at least one of the areas

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
that i i've been interested in learning

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
from

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,760
knowing that technology is just part of

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,440
the problem that's really how do we

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,840
connect with each other

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,840
and learn how to work and respect each

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,840
