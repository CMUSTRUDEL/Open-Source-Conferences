Abstract: Working openly can lead to unparalleled success—and not just for software projects. Values and ideas derived from open source communities are changing the ways we work, manage, and lead in industries across the globe—and the Open Organization community is exploring just how that’s happening.

In this session, attendees will learn more about the community and its mission to translate open source values and development best practices into techniques any organization can embrace to become more agile, innovative, and accountable.

Members of the open organization community will offer an overview of community-produced resources—definitions, models, articles, and books—and offer several practices your organization can begin implementing immediately as it works to become more open. They’ll also learn how to join the project—and, most importantly, how to contribute to its growing (open) library of materials.
