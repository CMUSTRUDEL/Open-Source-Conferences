Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: Every open source project has its own unique story to tell, whether itâ€™s a small personal hobby program or a big corporate-funded project. A project always starts with a single person making a single commit and putting it on GitHub. From there the storyline writes itself and, if done successfully, it will highlight the most important component of open source: the people, friendships, and collaborations.

Putting code on an open platform like GitHub is easy. There is almost no friction when you iterate on your first versions of your new open source project. However once it grows and more people start using it, it often feels overwhelming when they start filing issues and requesting your support. This often leads to maintainers abandoning their projects as they get burned out and users becoming frustrated when they have to transition to a different framework. People often forget that building a community around an open source project is just as difficult and important as the solution that the project provides.

In this talk, Christian Bromann will share his experience of building a community around an open source project. He will provide various tips and tricks that help guide you through the difficulties of acquiring new contributors and will teach you important lessons he learned along the way. At the end of the session you will walk away with actionable ideas that you can apply to your own open source projects.

and good morning um i'm christian i'm a

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,679
senior software engineer at sauce labs

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,160
working in the

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
program open source program office there

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
and uh if you have any questions during

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,720

uh post them immediately as we might not

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,279
have enough time for my q a session

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,960
um so please post them immediately all

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,640
right so today i want to

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
speak about open source and would like

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
to highlight to the human

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
aspect of it if you're working in open

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,280
source you're

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
certainly not only writing code you're

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
also working with humans

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
and particularly with communities which

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,680
is something that i find personally most

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
exciting

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
i'm also a big fan of humans of new york

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,039
and if you can already tell

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,360
my my design of my slides are aligned

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
to the humans of new york theme because

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,840
i want to

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
not only share some experience that i

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,719
make over the last years

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
but also want to highlight some open

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,359
source stories of people that i've met

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
over the years

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
and i appreciate for all the work they

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
have done in the open source community

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,360
i would like to start with a session for

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
myself

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,960
at my first conference i felt like being

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
backstage at a festival full of open

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,600
source artists

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,600
there were always these moments where

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,000
you would get starstruck if you would

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,880
see that person who built that library

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
working at that big tech company however

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
getting into casual conversations with

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,400
them

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
make you realize that they are just

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
normal people like you and me

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,240
being a passionate open source developer

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,079
then eventually even brought me in

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
situations where i would work

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,000
with them with the same artist on a

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
project together

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,280
it is fascinating how how many doors

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
just open magically

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
when all you do is tinkering on a hobby

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
project and share your passion with

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,360
others

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
and the fact that this experience is

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
accessible to everyone

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,520
if the community is filled with good

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,520
ethics is the best part about it

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
the open source project the hobby

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
project that i mentioned here

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,159
is web drive io a project that has

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,119
followed me around

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,280
for almost my whole career i started

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,680
using that project during my university

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,879
as i had to automate

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
tests for a single page application back

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,520
then

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
i started using the project more and

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,920
more eventually

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
found some bugs and i found the found

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
the um

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,959
found the time to contribute back to the

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
project which helped me to transition

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,400
from an open source user to an open

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,760
source contributor

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
there are so many different types of

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,440
open source project out there

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
uh that you could that you can interact

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,640
with back then when i started

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
contributing to reptile

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,599
it was pretty much a solo project which

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,120
is at currently 80 to 90 percent of all

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
the open source projects you find out

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
there

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,319
where there's one developer who is

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,319
responsible for maintaining it

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,319
now almost eight years later maintaining

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,519
reptile leo it has become a more

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
monarchist

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,519
type of framework where all decisions

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
are made by a project lead

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,040
and small number of lloydments if i

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
would get

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,959
just more active contributors to the

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
project it might eventually become a

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,959
community project

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
selenium if you have heard about that

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
project selenium is a typical community

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
project

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,080
where there's a clear governance

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
structure um that splits collaborators

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,720
into technical leaders and project

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,239
leaders

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,959
and all decisions are made

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
democratically at all times

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
then of course there are the big

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
corporate projects like react

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
where which is developed by facebook

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,360
where the world map

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
of these tools and projects are dictated

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
by a corporation behind it

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,720
and while there are corporate projects

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
that are have a more

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
collaborative discussion about road maps

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,440
and project decisions

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
at the end of the day the company has

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,879
the last word

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
and of course there are foundation

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,360
projects like graphql

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
where the whole decision making process

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
is formalized

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
and where consensus is found by a set of

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,280
diverse people

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
affiliated to different companies

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
building communities is really different

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
and it depends on the type of open

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,799
source project

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,920
that you that you're working with

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,799
when someone pushes code to github that

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
someone has

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,480
a specific reason why that person does

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,680
that and

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,239
has specific expectations to it someone

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
who just

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
pushes a hobby project that um they were

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
working on

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,199
during the weekend um will probably

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
this will probably just stay a hobby

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,840
project for the

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,880
whole lifetime of the of the code um

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,680
and on the other side big corporate

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
projects

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
have funding from big companies which

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
are

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,160
not likely to look into building a big

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
contributor base outside

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
however for projects that actually look

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
for contributors

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,360
to grow them to monarchists or community

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
projects

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
some of the first problems to tackle are

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,680
making

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,919
the open source projects inclusive

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
inclusiveness in tag has a special role

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
already and it can fill a whole talk by

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
itself

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,039
in this context it means that

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,520
contributions should not be

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,120
should not only be allowed by senior

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,360
developers who are experts in their

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
field but also by junior making them

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
possible for junior developers

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
and people who just start with open

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
source

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,160
i found four essential factors for

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
making an open source project inclusive

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,560
their scope technology documentation and

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,120
community

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,320
to keep the barrier low of understanding

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,720
the code base

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
it often makes sense to split the code

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039
base into multiple packages

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
projects you see a lot of projects

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
adapting lerner

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,320
and other monorepo technologies that

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,199
allow you to split

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,160
certain problem spaces into certain set

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,960
standalone packages this helps you to

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
reduce the cost of onboarding to the

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,479
code

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,800
as well as the code the problem space

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,639
itself

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,120
then technology where it is always

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,759
amazing if you can use the latest and

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,080
greatest from the language ecosystem

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,039
but be aware that certain technology

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,840
choices might affect your contributions

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,000
from outside for example if you add

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,479
typescript to your javascript project

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,680
or if you add a build dependency that

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,680
maybe works in mac but not in windows

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,840
people have that want to contribute to

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
the project need to know what typescript

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
is

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
and need to understand how to sit at

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,639
that complex build dependencies

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,960
to get started contributing a project

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,759
your technology choices should be always

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,360
um if reflect uh what kind of

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,400
contributors you expect

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,240
your projects to um get contributions

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,759
from

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
then of course there's documentation

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
parts where it's not only important to

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
have

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
really well written user-facing

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,000
documentation but as

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,520
crucial it is to have also well-written

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,520
contribution guidelines

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
that not only explain what kind of

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,479
contribution you expect from outside

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
collaborators

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,400
but also how those contributions are

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
supposed to be made

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,639
and lastly this is community aspect um

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,240
where you want to always have a

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,160
welcoming language for any kind of

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,000
contributions

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,160
it's one thing to give someone a thumbs

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
up on the pr but a whole different

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
if you write a personalized thank you

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,039
message for someone who first time

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,039
contributes to a project

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
after you spend some time making your

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,919
project a little bit more

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,599
inclusive it's time to go out and talk

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,960
to people about it

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
someone who has an interesting story to

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,840
share about exactly that is them

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,280
he wrote i was selected to present at

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
selenium conf in london

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039
about an entirely different topic and

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
during my presentation

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,520
i had shown some examples using selenium

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,280
to drive irs devices

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
several people came up to me after the

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,240
talk and were more interested in the ios

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
demo

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,520
than what i was actually presenting and

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,440
one of them said

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
i should do that demo as a lightning

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,759
talk later in the conference

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,879
so i signed up and the next day i took

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,560
the stage

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
the lightning talk host had mentioned in

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
the rules for the talks that speakers

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
had

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
30 seconds to get their presentation

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,440
going or they would be passed over

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
for the next speaker as my luck would

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
have it my macbook didn't like the

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400
projector

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,000
the host started the countdown and just

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
after he said one

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,360
the presentation finally showed up on

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
the projector

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,599
and the rest is history a few months

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
later the same lightning talk host

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,680
would form a group to start a new open

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
source project based on the demo

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,880
i gave at the conference and eight years

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,120
later appium is still going strong

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,479
it's amazing to think about that this

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
project appium

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
would probably never have existed if dan

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,240
would never have been able to show up to

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,519
show the presentation and get the

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,519
projector running

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
appium is one of the biggest mobile

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
automation frameworks that exists today

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,800
and the revenue source of so many

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
companies in the automation space

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
now that you got people excited about

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
your new project

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
it's time to collaborate which comes

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
with their with its ex

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
with its own challenges particularly if

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,959
you have been working

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
on this project as a sole and only

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,720
contributor

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,560
you start to create some sort of context

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,040
around certain problem spaces

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
and the code areas you probably know

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,279
this best if you

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,920
if you have been working on the code

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,000
base for multiple years you exactly know

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,120
where to fix a bug and where to look in

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,519
the code to add a feature

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,519
this context is important to document

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
for outside collaborators if you have an

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,000
open source project

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
bolotto who's a psychologist said on

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
this

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
context is everything your brain does

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
not do absolutes your brain

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,120
only does relationships that's all it

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,680
ever does and that's all it ever can do

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,360
so future collaborators might be able to

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,320
see all information by looking into the

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
repository

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
into the code and into the problem space

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,279
but all these information are pretty

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
much useless

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,640
as long as they can't refer to the

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,240
context contributors

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,640
have no access to what they are looking

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,519
for so as a maintainer we have the

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
obligation

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
to not only document the doc box but

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
also provide as much context as possible

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
i have a really bad example for myself

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
actually a couple of years ago

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,839
where i just created an issue for the

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,000
webdriver project saying

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
implement jasmine runner in my head

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
everything was clear

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,040
i just do it similar as i did with

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,920
mocker and it will probably turn out

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,160
well

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
but for outside collaborators this is

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
like useless and this is like not

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,040
helpful to get started helping out on

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,640
the project

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,600
context is king you can make your a test

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
by yourself

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,000
and go to the fortran or haskell open

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,120
source projects from the nasa github

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
organization

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,200
and look into the issues and the code if

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,160
you're a web developer like me you will

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
be like

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
what kind of language is that and what

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,000
kind of

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,240
what is this project even doing so

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,600
providing context is really essential

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
to allow contributors to even get

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,920
started looking into the issues

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,320
it i learned over time that it makes

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,519
more sense to spend five to ten minutes

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,680
to really give context to an issue and

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
give a description about current and

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
desired state

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
linked to code that is objective to

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,600
change and include

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,320
issues um if to increase the context

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,800
then spending 30 sec 30 minutes to fix

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,360
the issue by myself

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,200
it's also always good to add

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
contribution guidelines and

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,240
and and highlight the

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,600
issues that are well groomed and that

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,040
are good for people

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
to who want to get started

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
along the way it's of course critical to

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
be always helpful

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
another bad example for my past is where

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
i got

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,959
constantly the same issues all over

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,120
again about the deprecation notice

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,560
and i started to shorten my answer over

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
and over because i got

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
frustrated and worked out about um about

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
those issues

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,639
and i deserved the 34 don't vote issue

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,920
a post i learned that

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,519
i when i get worked up by maintaining a

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,279
large open source project

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,160
um i should step out um i always have to

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,440
i learned that i only have i should do

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
constructive comments

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
or no comments at all i should never

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,040
lose my kindness and all the interaction

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,200
that i have with the community

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,800
and if i feel burnt out because

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
maintaining an open source project can

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,320
be an additional burden

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,279
to your day-to-day job i should take a

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,279
break

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
and of course if the same question and

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
issues come up every

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,920
every time there is a problem with the

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,760
project and uh

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
faq might help to resolve this

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,480
john harband who who is working who's

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,040
part of the tc39 team he said once this

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,440
he said

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,360
i want to look back at my life at any

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,320
point and feel genuinely positive about

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
what i've done

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,040
what i've built and who i've interacted

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,279
with and how i left them feeling

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,959
so again if you feel burned out

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,360
maintaining an open source project

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
just step back take a pause for a week

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,040
and get back

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,839
to it with fresh mindset and

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,839
enthusiasm

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,279
another way to build up a community is

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,399
of course to also provide them in home

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,800
using tools like gita or slack

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,320
this can be difficult in the beginning

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
because you have to spend a lot of time

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,800
answering to people

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,519
and being there and gathering the folks

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,040
but it can be super helpful for people

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,600
to share their experiences

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,399
and support each other over time you

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
will see

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,440
that there will be some people who

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
rather spend time

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,440
in the community channel rather than

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,120
contributing with

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,320
with code patches and this is the same

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,399
equal contribution to a project um

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,600
than having code uh in my opinion

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,320
someone in the water project who really

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
stepped up

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,160
and became a really strong supporter for

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
a lot of people from the web develop

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,800
project

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,720
is olga and she wrote to me this

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,639
my introduction to the energy and

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
vitality of open source communities

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,279
occurred when i had an opportunity to

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,720
attend the selenium conference in boston

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,199
i would been working with selenium for

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
several years using java or c-sharp

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,399
when i first got started with a

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,800
web.project

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
having developed a framework gotten a

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,040
taste for the power and flexibility of

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
using javascript for ui automation

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
and worked through several web device

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
version upgrades i discovered that not

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,199
only was

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,880
the github web drive channel a great

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,920
resource for knowledge exchange for the

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,320
community

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
but there were that i was always often

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
able to answer a question on the channel

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
myself

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,880
this further increased my confidence and

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
deepened my own understanding of the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,240
project structure

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,720
and eventually i was able to commit a

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,639
few changes to the project

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
throughout i've enjoyed the chance to

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,160
chat with

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
and get to know the web users for all

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
over the world

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,839
this is just an so much interest so

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,399
interesting example of someone who

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,680
starts contributing um through this

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,040
community channel

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
and then go um technically to also make

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
qualitative

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
code contribution to the project

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
themselves

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,480
which brings us to the next chapter

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,720
three which is lead and inspire

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,040
once you build a little community you

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,199
will still have only a few people that

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
who who will actively work on the

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,199
project

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,040
and these few people have to inspire the

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,759
community with their actions

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,399
by giving back it is important to give

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,880
back

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,279
to provide some success moments moments

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,839
and reward people for their engagement

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,839
this not only increases incentives it

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
helps them to continue contributing to

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,959
the project

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
one of the things that i explored is to

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
just give

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,240
everyone who made a meaningful

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
contribution to the project

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,079
access to the github organization

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,279
there's really

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,240
no reason to close up a project

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
organization

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,120
and make it an inclusive club if you

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,079
invite people um you make them part of

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,000
the community

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,399
and this is really rewarding for a lot

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,399
of people

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
um it is also important that you provide

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,320
information about the trajectory of

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,120
contributions that someone made

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,480
over the time that could be part of your

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839
government's

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,199
description it's similar in your own job

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
where you want to know where

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,199
your career goes when you start when you

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,959
continue working at the company for a

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,199
longer time

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,120
another excellent utility to give back

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,399
to the community is to open

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,279
uh to offer open office hours um

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,519
i use this to connect on a weekly basis

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,320
with individual contributor

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
on individual issues i use the calendly

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,600
app

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
to just block some hours in my in the

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
week

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,839
and to really connect and pair with them

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,240
one-on-one

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
while this is while this requires a lot

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
of time on your side

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,959
it has a high return on the investment

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,360
because you not only

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
teach individual contributors to the

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,079
code base

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
you also provide them with all the

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,679
necessary contacts

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
that is needed to fulfill their tasks

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,360
and over time

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,000
the quality of their contribution will

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,559
increase

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,559
more and more

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,360
lastly once you have built up your

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,000
community once your project

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,960
started to impact the ecosystem you want

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
what you think about

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,600
govern your project at scale and some

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,919
ways you can do that is

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,640
to join a foundation like the openjs

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
foundation

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
the apache foundation or the software

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,720
freedom conservancy

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,559
those foundation can help you with legal

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,720
issues with marketing

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,400
uh with governance financially as well

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,120
as collaboration with other

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
foundation projects but don't join the

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
foundation

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
just to put their logo on your website

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,200
join a foundation as a growth goal

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
and as a goal to also support the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
foundations

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,160
uh the foundation in their efforts to

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,200
create a bigger community

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:14,000
um at large i want to end up

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,880
sharing um something that joey burson

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,320
wrote to me

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,280
um she said make 10 different shelters

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,799
with this old tire some wood and a piece

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,280
of rope

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,360
this kind of design exercise tests

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
resourcefulness and encourages you to

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,799
think about the nature

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,440
of the individual components and what

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,200
happens as they combine

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
to me working in open source and open

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,320
standards is very much like that sort of

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,520
puzzle

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,640
we may use the same tools people process

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
policy code etc but the results can be

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,559
can look

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,120
a lot different this industry has helped

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,760
me to

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,960
to appreciate this quality and work in a

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,840
more systemic way

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,280
less like an engineer more like a

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,840
painter how do tools combine

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,520
to solve the immediate problem and also

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,280
celebrate differences and respect

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
surrounding context

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,039
it's creative rewarding and not without

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,679
frustration or failure

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,280
you have to be willing to to work on

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
multiple timelines

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
try new things and change your

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,520
perspective

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,600
and patient helps with that

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,559
i want to end and thank you everyone for

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
participating

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
