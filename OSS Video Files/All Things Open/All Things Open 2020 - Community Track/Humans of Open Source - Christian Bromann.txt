Abstract: Every open source project has its own unique story to tell, whether itâ€™s a small personal hobby program or a big corporate-funded project. A project always starts with a single person making a single commit and putting it on GitHub. From there the storyline writes itself and, if done successfully, it will highlight the most important component of open source: the people, friendships, and collaborations.

Putting code on an open platform like GitHub is easy. There is almost no friction when you iterate on your first versions of your new open source project. However once it grows and more people start using it, it often feels overwhelming when they start filing issues and requesting your support. This often leads to maintainers abandoning their projects as they get burned out and users becoming frustrated when they have to transition to a different framework. People often forget that building a community around an open source project is just as difficult and important as the solution that the project provides.

In this talk, Christian Bromann will share his experience of building a community around an open source project. He will provide various tips and tricks that help guide you through the difficulties of acquiring new contributors and will teach you important lessons he learned along the way. At the end of the session you will walk away with actionable ideas that you can apply to your own open source projects.
