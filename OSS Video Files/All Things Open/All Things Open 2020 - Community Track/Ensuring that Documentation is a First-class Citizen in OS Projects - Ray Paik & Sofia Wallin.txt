Title: Ensuring that Documentation is a First-class Citizen in OS Projects - Ray Paik & Sofia Wallin
Publication date: 2020-12-14
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Community Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Ray Paik, Cube Dev & Sofia Wallin, Ericsson Software Technology
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: We often see many open source projects struggle with maintaining quality documentation and finding contributors who are interested in helping with project documentation. There are a number of reasons for this such as many viewing documentation as a separate product from code, or a belief that people will be able to make sense of what the code is doing by reading the code.  

For these and other reasons, documentation work is often done at the last minute, and done by people with low motivation and minimum effort. So the quality of the output will naturally suffer. These issues can be addressed by making sure that documentation is everyoneâ€™s responsibility and that documentation is a core part of the product that is created using the same development and community processes. 

In this session, Sofia will share her learnings as a documentation project lead in OPNFV and ONAP, and how their best practice is used throughout LF Networking. Ray will discuss how community contributions are managed for GitLab documentation and how community members are able to apply learnings from documentation to their contributions to other areas of GitLab.

let's get started

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,360
good so thank you so much regina and hi

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,880
and welcome everyone i'm sophia valen

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,760
and i work as a product manager

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,439
for ericsson software technology i'm

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,720
here today together with

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,519
um ray page from cube dev ray will

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
introduce himself later on during the

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,000
session

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
we're very happy to be here at all

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
things

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,399
open and our topic for today's session

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,760
is open source documentation

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,600
this is a topic that both ray and i

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,239
are big advocates for and

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
we know that documentation is often a

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,480
very hot topic in

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
our communities but unfortunately not

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,640
always

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,000
with the best um attention and

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,520
resources and so the intention

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,520
today is to share the experience that we

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,119
have done and learned over the past

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,360
years and if you have any questions

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
during the session please add them to

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,439
to the chat or or the q a and we will

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
address them

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,320
throughout the session a quick glance at

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
the agenda

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
and we will cover why documentation is

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,840
important

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,119
look at some common challenges that we

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,040
see and

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,040
i will then give you some insights what

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
we have done for the linux foundation

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
networking

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,119
ray will also give um

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,400
his insights on working with open source

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
documentation

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
we will then talk a bit about how to

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,200
encourage

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
doc contributions and then we will have

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,159
a

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
summary

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,200
why is documentation important then

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,119
first of all i and we see that or the

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,000
fact is that open source is not only for

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,200
developers

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,239
and not all people can read code

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,879
so it gets kind of narrow if

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
you don't provide good documentation it

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,840
is the

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,200
entry point and

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,000
for all users another interested it is

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
key for onboarding and project

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,720
introduction

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,840
and in the best world we documentation

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,280
would be treated in the same way um or

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
be a natural part of the software

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
delivery

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,120
what are the common challenges and that

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
we see then

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,760
and it's often done by a few

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,080
volunteers and even if you volunteer you

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,920
might not have too much experience

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
with with writing technical

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,200
documentation

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,319
it's often started um in the last minute

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
it's treated separately from uh from the

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,959
code

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,480
we see lack of consistency and often

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,440
poor quality and then this vicious cycle

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,920
basically just um continuously repeats

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
um

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,400
itself

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,239
what could we do then and i will share

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,680
now what we have done for the

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,000
linux foundation and networking and

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
a couple of years ago across community

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
working group was

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,239
established for lfn with the goal of

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
providing a common way for for

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
documentation handling

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,319
we saw um the need for this

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
since most of the projects were

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,400
struggling

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,080
with finding a sustainable way of

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,519
working and with documentation not all

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,560
projects had a designated lead which led

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
to

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,040
a community effort with often

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,040
a pretty low um priority

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,480
and we also saw an unnecessary

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,480
overlap for maintaining guidelines

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,360
what did we achieve then first of all

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,599
um way more consistency across the

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
projects within lfn

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,440
we provided clear and simple guidelines

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,639
for how to work with documentation

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
and documentation contributions are

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,280
treated in the same way

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,280
as code contributions and this goes for

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,560
metrics as well as recognitions

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,880
however the products do

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,560
store local style guides and templates

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
because this might differ a bit

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,919
um between the templates and as you can

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
see here

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,960
at the bottom of the page there is a

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,800
link to

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,720
to the common documentation and tool

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,520
guide that we have provided

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,919
to give you some more concrete examples

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,360
on what we have done i'm going to use

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,960
the open network automation

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,520
platform project the onap project and

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
how to work with documentation is

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,000
something that i've been working

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
and together with david mcbriden who is

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
the release manager

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,479
for onap among other projects within lfn

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,960
and

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
we've been working together for many

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
years and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,600
ray was also involved if we go back to

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,120
when we were working with

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,199
with opnfv and what we have established

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,840
it that way is that we have

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,000
designated milestones for documentation

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,960
for its release cycle and this goes all

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
the way from

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
planning to having your repo structure

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,280
in place with associated templates

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
and reviews and all the way to to sign

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,360
off

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
we don't let projects get away with not

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
completing their documentation

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,919
and i think that this one is also

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,639
important to ensure that you have your

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,800
technical committee and your ptls really

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,479
emphasizing the importance

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,759
and of documentation we do

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,840
schedule two documentation hackathons

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
per release cycle i'm going to

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
talk about this a bit more in detail

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,759
later on but that's something that's

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,840
been

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
really successful and helpful as well

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,000
and we do provide templates and

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,039
with expected level of of content

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,080
as i also mentioned earlier and

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,720
even if people do volunteer and with

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,639
writing

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,800
and supporting the documentation and

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,199
there might not be too much experience

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,919
so this has also been very helpful to

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,160
to indicate somewhat of expected level

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,880
of content and what certain documents

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
should

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,319
should contain and

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,560
we also track all the documentation

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,370
tasks in jira as we do with

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,599
with all um the other work and um

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,759
[Music]

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
the last thing is that the documentation

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,520
is stored in

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
respective projects repo and this is

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
basically to

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,199
to enforce the responsibility and to

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,319
really ensure that all projects

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,919
um see that their documentation is also

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,280
part of of their

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,120
software and development

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,080
and with that i think i'm going to leave

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,840
the floor to ray

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
thanks sophia i think there was a

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,960
comment i was keeping track of

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,319
uh questions on uh yeah i encourage

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
people to continue

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,360
making comments on on the chat or the q

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
a

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,520
uh i'll just read that off real quick uh

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
computer documentation has long been

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,960
like government funding nobody wants to

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,720
contribute to it but

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,720
everyone wants it to be there when when

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
they need it uh sophia i don't know if

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
you want to like

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,639
address that i mean i think it's well

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,759
said but

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,120
go ahead and if you have any comments

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
to add to that but

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
yeah i mean it's it's a very valid

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,160
comment and it's it's all true

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,360
it's everybody talks about it

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
but as i said we don't have too many

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,479
resources

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,520
um doing it we have actually been very

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,360
i would say almost blessed and getting

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
support from technical writers

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
in some of the projects that i've been

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,599
involved in but that doesn't really

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
take away the actual work of of

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,479
providing documentation because the

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,640
people that are

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,000
doing the software development are also

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,479
the people that that

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
know stuff and and that information

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,440
needs to be

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,880
delivered um either way so it's it's a

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,399
joint effort and it's tough

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,800
and yes everybody talks about it right

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,760
now i mean i think like you know some of

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
the points that

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
uh sofia you alluded to and you know

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
i've i've seen this as the part of the

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,600
elephant community member

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,279
uh while you're leading a lot of these

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,839
documentation efforts

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
yeah i mean the trick is to i mean it's

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
it's

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,080
tricky to do in open source community

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
because consensus is very important but

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
you got to give

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,720
people like there's got to be

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
accountability uh on things like

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
i mean people all realize that

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,440
documentation is important but

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
uh you know like sophia alluded to like

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
people gonna step back and when the work

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
needs to be done but there needs to be

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
accountability and checks

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
checks and balances make sure that it's

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,720
it's done but

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,360
uh andy it's like a well said um

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
so yeah i'll i guess i'll i'll introduce

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,680
myself and

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,839
and continue uh on on the presentation

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
uh again my name is ray bake and i was

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
at uh linux foundation actually for

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
several years that's where i got to work

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
with sofia

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,839
on on a number of networking projects at

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,560
the lf and

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,440
a couple years ago in 2018 i actually

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
made a

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,839
job change uh to join gitlab so i moved

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,959
from a foundation-based open source

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
project to

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,240
a company's based open source project

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
and and

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,360
uh i just recently this is my second

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,160
week in in my new current role like cube

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
dab

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,480
uh so i moved to another like a single

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
company based like an open source

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
project

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
uh so that's sort of been my progression

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,760
over the past

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,680
few years i i assume a lot of people are

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,360
very familiar with with gitlab so i

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
don't think i'll get into that but cubed

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,279
up this is a

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,920
relatively new community

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,519
and it basically helps you build

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,040
analytics tools uh

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,360
to for for your business application so

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
feel free to check them out but uh it's

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,519
been an interesting progression

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
as i move from like a foundation-based

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,920
project that involves

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,200
uh several different companies to uh

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,480
to projects like gitlab and and cube

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,959
um so i mean one of the things that uh

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
i mean i had to obviously make uh go

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,000
through some culture changes going

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,839
to a single company based project and

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
if you think about it for open core

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,040
companies like get lab

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,160
uh your documentation is probably a lot

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,720
more critical than

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
traditional uh you know collaborative

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
open source projects because

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
like open core companies that will have

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,480
a free version of your of their product

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,240
uh like community edition that's free

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,360
but they'll also have like a

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,120
you know premium or enterprise edition

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
that customers need to pay for

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
uh to for the additional features or

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
services

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
and you know if you're paying for a

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,640
product support and documentation is

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
even more critical

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
so i was actually curious as to see how

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,160
documentations are done

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,560
in in projects like gitlab and it's to

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
to my surprise actually some of the best

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,720
practices that i've seen

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
uh at the linux foundation networking a

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
lot of

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,079
uh translates directly into uh

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
to open core projects like gitlab uh

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,600
things like you know making sure that

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,279
co uh your documentation is core part of

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
your product or a project

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,720
uh making sure that like a documentation

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
is easy to find

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,800
right next to the code so i mean i have

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,839
a couple of images here for gitlab and

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,480
cube

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,760
if you go to the top level directory of

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,600
the respective project

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,200
you'll see a folder for documentation

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,560
right there along with the code

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
so you don't have to hunt or search

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,639
around for it so

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,160
it looks like you're first class citizen

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,000
because you you know where all the

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,000
important information stored like like

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,959
code it's that's where the documentation

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
is

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,959
so you want to make it easy to find uh

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,720
at the top level directory and don't

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
hide it somewhere else

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,519
so it doesn't look like a first class

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,639
citizen the other thing i liked

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
at get lab was it i mean this slide

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
should be posted along with the

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
recording

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,680
so if you click on this definition of

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
done on the pdf slide

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,360
you'll take it to a documentation page

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
on the checklist items

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,160
of the things that you need to do to

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
have your

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
merge requests merge and one of the

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,200
requirements is documentation

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,279
if you're implementing a new feature or

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
tweaking a existing feature that affects

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
users you either need to update the

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,519
documentation

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,560
or create a new documentation to

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,800
for that new feature or or or

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,880
the feature change that you're proposing

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,639
so if the documentation is not done

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
that mr is not going to get merged with

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
that feature change that you're trying

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
to do

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,680
so it's similar to how uh when sophia

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
talk about it the lfn like if you meet

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,120
don't meet that documentation milestone

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
it's not going to be part of the release

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,440
that's how we uh so at gitlab that's how

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,560
you introduce discipline

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,240
and obviously i mean gitlab we had a lot

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,399
of community contributors if they needed

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
help with documentation uh to

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
complete their work i mean obviously we

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
you know gitlab have technical writers

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,000
that we're willing to help

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
uh so that but we want to make sure that

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,760
you know that documentation piece is

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,240
done so that the feature can be

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,079
uh can be merged so that's sort of one

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
way of introducing discipline

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,920
um to making sure that documentation is

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
done

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,399
um so the next we'll talk about i think

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
sophia addressed this as well

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
in linux foundation networking the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
contribution process

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,880
for documentation uh and

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,120
i think there was a first slide i mean a

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,720
lot of people start making documentation

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,160
contribution even if you're very

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
experienced from different open source

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
projects

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
uh to get up to speed in terms of you

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
know how

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,639
you know reviews are done how how your

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
pull requests or merge requests are

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
triaged

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,880
and you know get familiar with the

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
review process

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
um so if if people get started on

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,800
documentation

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,959
a lot of people do you want to make that

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,880
process consistent with how

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,959
code changes are done as an example or

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,279
even your exchanges are done

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,320
because if people sort of get on board

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,480
into community

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
by making documentation updates or

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
changes

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
you don't want them to have to relearn a

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,720
different process for

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
like code changes for example so having

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
a consistent process

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,800
between documentation and the rest of

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,680
your project is is pretty important and

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,199
i strongly recommend like the people to

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
do that unless there's a very good

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,560
reason

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
to have separate processes and uh there

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
was also a saying

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
uh at gitlab everything starts with a

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
merge request

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
and everything obviously includes like

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
documentation whether it's documentation

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
changes or

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
or coaching news or et cetera et cetera

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,760
so we strongly

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
encourage people to have a consistent

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,320
process

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,959
for documentation versus like code

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,360
the other way to sort of make a

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,279
documentation contribution easy

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
you've probably seen this from from a

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,920
lot of the open source projects

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,959
so on the left this is sort of a

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,959
screenshot from

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
if you go scroll down to any of the docs

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,040
pages at gitlab like docstockgitlab.com

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,160
you'll see this

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,959
like a purplish box would edit this page

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,839
button

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,160
so if you're reading through

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,839
documentation if you see a typo or if

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,440
you see a documentation on particular

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,079
section that you think can be improved

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,680
just

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
click on that link and it takes you

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,519
directly to that file

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,120
so you don't have to hunt for it uh in

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,399
the repo

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,399
trying to figure out which which

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,560
directory that you need to you know

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
navigate towards to find it so you you

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
hit that button takes it to the folder

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
and all you need to do from that point

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
on is basically you

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,399
click on the edit button and off you go

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,279
you're you're ready to make your changes

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,240
uh and gitlab even took it further uh

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,360
not just like a

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
you know project or product

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,000
documentation but even through their

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
websites

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,079
so if you go to about.getlab.com and if

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,600
you go to the community page or even

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,120
like pricing page

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,040
and if you see something that you want

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,399
to change there like you all you need to

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,120
do is just scroll to the bottom

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
and hit like edit this page link and and

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,839
you're ready to go

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,959
uh and q dot js is the same if you go to

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,360
the docs page

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,120
actually the edit this page button is on

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,040
the on the top right

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,399
um and i was when i first saw that i

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
because i was so used to seeing this

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,519
button at the bottom of the page i was

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
thinking that might be a better place to

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,679
place it

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,079
because not everybody will necessarily

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,439
scroll all the way down to the webpage

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,880
for the documentations so

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,280
i mean when i was actually starting to

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,439
talk to the qbas community

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,559
there are a couple things that i check

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,720
to to get

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
familiar with the uh with the community

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,559
and the project

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
i mean one was um i mean you can tell

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,799
i'm

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,240
i'm a community manager like one of the

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
things i checked was there was a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,160
community code of conduct

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
to make sure it's welcoming and et

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
cetera et cetera

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,880
and the other thing i did check was on

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
documentation it was a you know

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
how long is it going to take me to find

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,240
it or is it easy to

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,679
uh contribute to docs so i mean those

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,440
are some that like a

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,440
early criteria that i was looking at

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
when i was talking to the community

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,720
members

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,480
so yeah i mean if you're starting a new

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,039
project or if you already have a project

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,720
i just i think these are just simple

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,320
tools to just make it easy to

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,720
encourage contribution and have more

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,919
people participating

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,559
uh see the next one is on

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,919
like your recognitions and sofia touched

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,880
on this too

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
uh you really don't want to distinguish

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,760
between contribution

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
whether that's made to code or

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,039
documentation i mean if you're going to

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,400
recognize people

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,039
i mean you know i had a saying at gitlab

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
for me mrs and mrs and mr like i don't

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,280
care what kind of

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,120
you know improvement that you're making

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,720
to the project or the product

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,039
uh so when you have like a dashboard for

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
uh for contributions like i mean there's

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,559
a dashboard

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,120
uh that you can it's it's a public

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,760
dashboard that you can look at

00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,840
contributors.getlab.com

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,160
it's we're looking at all merge requests

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,880
not just code or not just some subset of

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,760
it

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,520
uh and we had some uh fun like a

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,919
recognition program as well i mean one

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,400
of them

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
is if you get your first mr merge you

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
can request this

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
uh camper mug with the hashtag

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,840
myfirstmlr

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,840
merge um and it didn't matter i mean you

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,360
you just fill out a google form and we

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,440
send them out it didn't matter whether

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,400
it was for simple changing the docs or

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,720
or other more like uh advanced feature

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
changes that people were making

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,760
so we put everything on the equal

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
footing

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
and the final piece there uh is at

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
gitlab

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
in the gitlab community we have a group

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,320
of people called the core team

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
and you've probably seen this

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
terminology used in other communities

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
like

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
uh ruby on rails and i mean basically

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,880
these are people that have made

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
sustained contribution over

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
a long period of time and they get

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
nominated and get voted on

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
and basically they're the voice of the

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,039
rest of the community uh they're

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,640
you know it's they've taken on a you

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,760
know visible leadership role in the

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,480
community

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,440
and uh i mean i won't read through the

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,679
whole charter

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
like one of the things that we made this

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
change about

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
about a year ago or a little over a year

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
ago

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,080
because i thought the the mission

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,000
statement was focused too much on like a

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,559
co-development so we wanted to

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
be inclusive of all the contributions

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
and recognize all different sorts of

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,640
contributions that community members can

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
make

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,720
and we specifically spelled out like a

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
documentation as i highlighted there

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,480
so moving to the next topic as sophia

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,520
alluded to we'll talk about

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,960
uh like events or or

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,000
or um uh other activities that you can

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
do to encourage

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,760
uh contributions and i'll share a couple

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,720
of examples of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,039
uh of the events that we participated at

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,919
uh

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,039
at get level where we organized uh i

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,600
mean even if you have

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,080
a very good documentation uh or web

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,320
pages for onboarding or wiki pages

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
uh i mean there's really no substitute

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
for having a

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,039
sort of a synchronous event to get all

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,600
the community members together

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,520
uh i mean obviously this is you know

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,360
this is all happening virtual now

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,520
because of coven 19.

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,039
um but we've actually done this uh

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
before like a world start

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,919
started shutting down we've had events

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,840
early in the year that was in person

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,159
but we also done like a number of events

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,760
virtually to encourage people to

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,720
you know contribute to get lab

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,799
particularly on documentation

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
and the one example i mean you can look

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,919
at the youtube recording

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,000
i have the i have the link right here uh

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
i mean basically this was like a 45

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,559
minute session

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,320
uh and then uh and the topic was

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,559
basically contributing to gitlab

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,640
but all the issues that we use as an

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,480
example were documentation related so we

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
wanted to make it very simple

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,240
even for very beginners so the first

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,600
half of the

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,679
meetup we sort of walked through the

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,880
mechanics of here's your how you find

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,280
issues how you file a merge request

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
and you know how the process of things

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,320
getting reviewed

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,120
um and then we broke up the group in

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,200
about

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,360
in i believe in two groups so i mean my

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,120
colleague john and i were just like

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,120
we were acting like merge request

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,799
coaches and encourage people to work on

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,960
uh simple typo issues uh that we had uh

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,480
created uh that you can click on a link

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
here

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,240
and then in 15 20 minutes people were

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
just submitting their first merge

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,080
request

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,120
um so it was a pretty fun session um and

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,840
uh uh i mean the benefit of

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,039
uh having a virtual session was that uh

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,400
you know i didn't know what the makeup

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,080
was going to be i believe

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,760
you know the meetup happened at like 9

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,400
a.m pacific time but we had

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,679
like contributors uh or new contributors

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
dialing in from

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,799
all the way from turkey um so it was

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
good to have like a diverse group of

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,799
people participating

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,240
so that's sort of a good way to you know

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,799
get people introduced not

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,480
just your project but also you know let

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,840
them know that you know we value

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
documentation

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
improvements that input that people

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,039
provide

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,120
i mean the other good example that i

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,000
have i'm this we did this event

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,559
um another virtual event about a month

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
ago

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,840
and this was a group with a group of

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,000
people called the last mile

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,440
uh lastmodel.org is their website so

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,440
these are people that are

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,200
working on people that are serving time

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
or that are incarcerated and want to

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,559
give them

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,600
like a tools to get them trained for for

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
the job market

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,200
uh when they return to the society so we

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,240
had a group of people

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,159
uh alums from the the last mile group

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,919
and we sort of went through the similar

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
exercise like walking them through

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,360
here's how you make a contribution to

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
open source and here's an example of how

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,240
you do it in gitlab

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
uh so it's one of the most like a

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
meaningful like a sessions i've been a

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,640
part of

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,559
we not only got like first-time

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,120
contributors contributing but

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,320
um i felt like you know i was able to

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,720
you know contribute to

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,000
bettering the society just at least in

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,400
the u.s

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,799
um and the other thing i want to point

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,320
out and this is something that at

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,000
cube that this is something that we're

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
thinking about organizing in the next

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,360
few months

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,279
is to because one of the things we want

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,159
to do is to improve our documentation as

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,039
our

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,760
users and community members are growing

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,400
but you know hacking or working on

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,520
or improving on documentation it's uh i

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,919
mean it's

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,159
it's the best uh it's one of the you

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
know better excuses to get like a users

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
and

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,039
and community members involved i mean it

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,039
doesn't require a whole lot of uh

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,559
like a technical expertise for people to

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,919
contribute and then

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,679
they're they're the ones that are

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,000
actually using uh

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,000
your documentation on on on day to day

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,520
basis so i mean their insights very

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,039
helpful

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
so i mean that's something that we're

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,720
planning on doing uh hopefully in the

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,679
next few months

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,159
um another event that i want to talk

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,679
about

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,640
i mean you don't have to organize or or

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,880
or be part of an event that's just

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,760
solely focused on your community or your

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,600
company

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,039
uh there are also like industry events

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,080
that you can participate in

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,320
and one good one that that gitlab is

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,400
has been participating in a few years is

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,240
is the right to docs event um

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,559
i mean they typically have three events

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,679
a year uh one in the u.s

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,159
they think it usually happens in

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,600
portland or again one in europe and then

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,360
i think the third one happens

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,039
in somewhere in australia to cover the

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,200
epac region

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
but what they do is they typically have

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
as their

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,559
day zero event uh they have a writing

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
day so you can

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,679
uh let me see so you see the picture

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
there uh

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,760
on the website basically what happens is

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,200
that on sundays people get together on

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,679
various roundtables

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,640
so you so whether companies or open

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
source projects

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,880
and so it's sort of like having an uh

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,279
office hour so people can kind of stop

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,440
by

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
and and talk to employees at gitlab as

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
an example

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,320
and they get introduced to the project

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,080
but also get a chance to sort of

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
help contribute and and hack on

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,720
documentation

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,600
um so we i mean participated in

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,960
in in one like last year was in person

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
in portland and this year

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,039
obviously everything moved to virtual uh

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,480
we weren't quite sure how it was going

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,760
to go i mean first of all

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,520
it's it's sunday uh and people are not

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
traveling to portland for example to

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
attend the conference we weren't quite

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,400
sure how many people were like willing

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
like will will actively participate in

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,480
in the writing day but

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,080
it was like a busy full day on sunday i

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
mean i was i was pretty

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
uh pleasantly surprised uh like you can

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
see the stats there we

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,760
had a lot of first-time contributors

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,080
contributing to gitlab with over 40

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,159
like a contributions uh so it was

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,279
definitely like a day well spent on a

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,240
sunday

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,520
uh i mean i i originally signed up for

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,760
like a two-hour window

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,279
uh to sort of help out but i mean i

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,080
think i ended up staying for like three

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,080
hours

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
because it got so busy and it got very

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,279
active

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,799
and the other thing i learned was that

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,120
uh even people

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,159
that are you know like a technical

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,480
writers

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
a lot of them are actually interested in

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,600
participating in various open source

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,240
projects and looking for ways to get

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,559
involved

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,279
uh so i thought this was a good way to

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,240
sort of get

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,080
um you know get the word out on on on

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,460
the gitlab community and get new

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,880
contributors involved so i'll

00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,600
[Music]

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
stop there and turn things over to sopia

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,880
and she'll talk about some of the

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,880
linux foundation networking events

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,520
thank you so much ray and

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,279
so as i said earlier um we do have

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,679
um do two uh documentation hackathons

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,360
per

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,919
release cycle um

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
needed to come up with something

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,880
innovative how to make

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,840
docs um a bit more fun and a bit more

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,120
attractive

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,399
and to call it a hackathon

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,880
or a hack event and and to have a full

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,840
day dedicated to release related content

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,880
has been

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,720
really um helpful and and appreciated by

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,080
the by the community and we

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,679
perform reviews and the documentation

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,840
team is available for

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,799
for questions and and general

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,960
documentation

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,159
introduction and and and for the ona

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,760
project we have

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,360
taken it as far as participation in one

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,960
of the events is actually part of the

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,600
release requirements which is

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,399
super helpful and this is always a

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
virtual

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,200
event we try to cover

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,679
as many time zones as as possible um

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
and we're trying to always set the date

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,399
with respect to code freeze because

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,919
we need to be realistic as as well and

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,720
i'm trying to

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,679
push for for the work with documentation

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,320
to start too

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,440
early it's not going to work and and

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
i've seen that

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,159
if if we start to push more for it after

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,159
code freeze people have

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,399
a whole another mindset and they can be

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,520
more focused on on

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,840
um doing their

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
um doing their documentation

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,360
and then thank you right

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,080
and just some general comments uh submit

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,600
the session

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,279
wherever you can i mean there are

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,399
multiple events out there

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:17,600
and they have various tracks

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,440
so bring documentation my experience is

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,399
that hands-on sessions are

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
more productive and they add a lot of

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,480
value

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,440
so sit down and and do fun stuff

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,080
meet with others projects and set up

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,720
joint

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
joint sessions i mean it's it's all

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,200
about collaboration

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,440
and i think it's important to remind

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,600
community members and that there are

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,159
many different aspects of documentation

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,240
it's not

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,200
only writing technical documentation we

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,960
have

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
tools and we need to maintain the tool

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
chain and there's

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,320
automation you can automate stuff as

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,120
much as possible

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,600
and just to get the word out there and

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,159
and

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,640
to ensure that it gets the attention

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,640
needed

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,520
and with that i think we will have a

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,120
quick summary here

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,200
um so summary and some recommendations

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,000
ensure that documentation is a key part

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,360
of your product and project

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,440
and to have a consistent process between

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,279
submitting reviewing and merging code

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,600
and documentation

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,240
and have a well documented and

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,480
easy-to-follow process for contributing

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,960
to documentation

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
and that everybody in the community

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
recognizes

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,640
and understands the value of

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,600
documentation is

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,159
also something super important and at

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,480
the bottom here as well you have

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:53,279
a blog post published by ray and myself

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,240
at opensource.com where you can read

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,840
about

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,880
read a bit more about what we have

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
discussed here today

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,840
yeah and then on the blog post i mean

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,039
feel free to leave comments there i mean

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,120
there are a couple of people

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,600
uh shortly after it was published uh

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,120
will welcome questions and feedback

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,080
um and uh yeah i mean just to

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,919
i mean one of the things that uh that

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,399
sofia you mentioned like on events i

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,760
mean i

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,000
really like the fact that it's been

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,760
obviously like a two three years but

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,080
even at technical design summit there

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
was always like a session dedicating to

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,360
dogs

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
which tend to be like well attended uh

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,159
so

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,440
i thought that was uh pretty cool and

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,840
and uh

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,240
yeah i mean i'm sure that's still still

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,200
happening with with design summits

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,159
um looks like i was looking at i got

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,320
sophia where are you gonna

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,760
yeah and i mean and it does and i think

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,080
that it's

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,320
my experience is if you reach out to

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
other communities or or other projects

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,320
that will participate in a conference

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,080
it's easier to get a bigger crowd to

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,679
talk about documentation rather than

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,399
just having your own

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,200
project so to reach out and collaborate

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,519
with people

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,640
and and really schedule sessions and and

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,760
just

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,440
force documentation to be as

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,440
fun and cool as as all the code stuff

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,880
it's it's been really helpful to to

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
schedule sessions like that

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,720
and even if people just come and listen

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,840
in there will be a discussion because

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,679
people do care about documentation it's

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,840
just about taking the time to

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,960
to also create and write and work with

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,440
it

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,000
cool thanks it looked like there are a

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,600
couple of questions

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,440
and let's say from sean this looks great

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,880
for technical contributors and technical

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,320
documentation but do you have any

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,000
metrics on how

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,000
effective your changes are with

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
non-technical contributors is this

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
something

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,880
being tracked uh sophia they want to

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,120
take that one first

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
not sure i fully understand go ahead if

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,600
you

00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,480
yeah i'll i i guess yeah i mean

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,000
uh i i think i sort of understand the

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,399
spirit of the question but if i'm not

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,080
addressing it uh appropriately sean i

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,159
mean please feel free to

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,480
uh uh uh for the comments as well i mean

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,600
on

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,440
metrics uh i mean at least that gitlab

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,679
is an example like we didn't

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,519
like distinguish between whether if this

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,519
was a documentation change

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,360
whether it was uh like a more of a

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,720
technical contribution or something

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,559
that's more

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
came something that came from a more

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,080
casual contributor like

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,039
catching a typo for example or grammar

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,200
error or

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,399
you know was it addressing you know this

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,399
is technically incorrect

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,240
the command should be this and this and

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,360
this there's a syntax error

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,600
um so we didn't necessarily distinguish

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,799
like you know we had a label for called

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
documentation if

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,039
people were contributing like a

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,440
documentation mr related mrs but

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,159
uh we didn't like attract something like

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,799
you know

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,600
uh one that are like a simple fixes

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,320
versus

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,080
like a more lucky extensive content

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,360
changes necessarily

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,640
um but i mean hopefully that uh answers

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,679
some of your questions but sophia i

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,399
don't know if you want to add it

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,359
yeah no i mean same goes for for lf i

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,679
mean

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,320
we use garrett for everything so even if

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,079
you submit the patch or push a patch for

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,919
for any um like feature changes or

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,560
documentation changes you will still

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,480
have your

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,000
your stats accounted for as as

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,560
documentation commits

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,760
so we don't really distinguish that and

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
i mean if

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,320
i know i don't remember what it's called

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,440
ray but i remember we had some

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,679
um community leading award and stuff

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,399
like that and that could be

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,480
counted for when you do maybe supporting

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,119
the conferences or doing stuff on the

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,320
wiki

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,440
and i mean there are many different ways

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,520
of of tracking and non-technical

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,159
contributions as well

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,280
right i mean in in terms of like how

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,200
effective

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,880
our changes have been like how do we

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,280
notice like i guess you know sean

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,440
indirectly the one way we would see is

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,520
like overall is a contribution to

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,160
documentation growing for example

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,079
like because that we made it easier uh

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,839
because we made things easier to find

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,960
and because we encourage people to do it

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,839
i mean we'll see

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,440
like overall number of for example mrs

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,320
merged with with their documentation

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,440
label that's

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,720
indirectly how we uh we tracked it but

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
we didn't necessarily

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,760
distinguish between like a simple fixes

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,119
versus

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,280
something that was more technically

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,560
involved

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,280
the next question is from regina uh

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,960
are is our audits conducted on a regular

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,200
basis to ensure that most relevant

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,119
documentation is available and

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,720
if it's irrelevant are they archived i

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,920
mean it's a very good question like

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,680
sophie i don't know if uh if you want to

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,240
uh have an example from from the lfn but

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,200
or tell me to take it first or yeah yeah

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,000
i mean so

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,880
i mean at get lab i mean we fortunately

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,040
had uh

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,720
i mean i i forget what the number is now

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,440
i mean they had probably

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,839
about dozen technical writers on staff

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,200
uh

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,599
and they routinely go through the

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
process of sort of you know updating the

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
documentation structure

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,800
like you know is this is this the right

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,200
way to structure the documentation or

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
some things that need to be archived and

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,440
uh or

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,920
or like removing like for example and

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,119
and actually there were we got a lot of

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,119
documentation

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,240
uh merge requests from community members

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,400
saying you know this

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,079
version is like incorrect because like

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,320
whatever dependency we had like that

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,720
version has been upgraded and changed

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,240
uh so i mean community members do catch

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
a lot of them but more structural

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,680
changes i think

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,520
uh what i've seen over the past like a

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,040
few years i get lab is that at least

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,640
like a couple times a year they go

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
through so they look at the structure

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,599
and see it

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,760
needs to be updated um uh based on how

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,040
example especially if there are new

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,839
product stages or

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,960
or features that are being introduced uh

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,880
so that's an example

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,800
from uh from git lab like so so sophia

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,920
on like onap or other projects

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,920
like uh once like

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,680
for example if the project is archived i

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
assume the documentation gets archived

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,000
as well

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,240
right yes yes it does um

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,440
it's been archived i would assume that

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,119
it's

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,960
somewhere as an artifact and you could

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,560
probably access it if

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,040
if you want to we do publish um

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,240
our releases and our documentation on

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,599
reader docs

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,200
so you can go between um several

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,280
versions you can have like i think it's

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
two released prior to the current one

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,079
and then you

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
have latest which shows what's on the

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,240
master branch

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,400
and so so we really don't have any um

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,839
scheduled audits it's a community effort

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,359
to ensure that we

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,880
update everything that needs to be

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,920
updated before each release

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,240
cool and yeah sean just followed up uh

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,520
with this question the question was

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,720
regarding

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,200
uh people who know nothing about like

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,520
garrett pull requests or merge requests

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,760
uh the code change process

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,640
yeah i mean for i mean at least at

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,920
gitlab

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,359
um i mean you know maybe unbiased uh the

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,359
process of using the tool

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,680
i mean whether i think between github or

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,240
gitlab is pretty similar the mechanics

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,400
of

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,520
sort of using the software i mean it

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
just takes some training

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,119
i mean maybe for i mean for most people

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,800
like at 20 minutes

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,400
20 30 minutes of here's sort of the

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,119
mechanics of uh

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,320
here's how you find the file here's how

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
you hit the edit button

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,440
and then here's how you submit a merge

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
request and you know you want to write

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,240
like a certain commit messages

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,320
uh et cetera et cetera um

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,280
uh i i don't think it's too difficult to

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,240
do because at

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
gitlab we even had like uh children

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,040
contributing

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,599
uh like that were like eight to twelve

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,800
years old uh and they were mostly doing

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,040
uh simple typo fixes uh and

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,720
obviously like the parents were coaches

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,720
and sort of set them through

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,240
uh you know walking through the process

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,880
of here's how you make contributions

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,720
using gitlab or like even github

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,560
um so uh you know i think that's

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,920
you know i mean obviously it's not a

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,839
huge group of people

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
at gala community that were contributing

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,400
that were like less than 12 years old

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,200
but

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
i i think you know that you know i i

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
think with the proper

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,160
amount of coaching and guidance i think

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,200
a lot of people uh

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,160
you know can figure out how to use

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
how to use uh even garrett github or

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,040
gitlab to

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,480
you know make your first contributions

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,599
but i mean if if

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,119
uh if um i mean i could be very biased

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,400
and mistaken but

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,920
that's sort of been my experience

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,599
and and and sophie is i mean i i i know

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,880
like from my memory at the lfn i mean

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,640
there are people who are marketing

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,880
people that were making contributions to

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,640
docs too right so they were not

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,480
necessarily technical people

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,480
no definitely not then i mean it ties

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,320
back to the topic that we have here to

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,800
have good onboarding documentation and

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
allow

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,040
anybody that wants to join and come

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,359
contribute to be able to

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,240
to understand and read up on and and

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,119
quickly understand how to

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,280
make your first commit or or doing a put

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,520
request and and so on and you

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,920
start small and then you learn more more

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
and more

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,040
well other questions you've got about

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,040
five minutes left it looks like

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,440
yeah i mean as i said the the uh i think

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
within a few days along with the video

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,720
this slide should be posted so you

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,000
should be able to click on these links

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,200
uh but feel free to ping us uh

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,200
you know either yeah linkedin or like i

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,200
guess sophia you're not on twitter but

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,640
uh happy to follow up with any of your

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,680
questions or even

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
uh leave comments on the blog let's see

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,520
that

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,480
looks like we might have two more that

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,599
came in all right last minute

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,599
uh from also another one from

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
from a user standpoint how do you feel

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,599
multi-format delivery

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:19,760
is for docs versus web html pdf

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,800
uh how can or should oss tools integrate

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,680
with traditional events layout tools

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,680
wow that's a

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,760
that's a really deep one uh

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,520
uh yeah i mean hopefully this answers

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,160
your question like i think

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,200
i mean particularly on on collaborative

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,040
projects like

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,720
uh linux foundation networking i mean

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,640
there are lots of debates about like

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,119
what kind of format it should be should

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,920
it be epub dot txt

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,280
uh i mean i think that involves a lot of

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,720
you know discussions and

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,480
i mean you need to get to some sort of a

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
consensus on what kind of format that

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,800
you want to deliver it in

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,839
i mean uh i know like during the early

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,920
stages of the project formation that was

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,119
discussed um in detail but i mean sophia

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,880
i don't know if the

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,560
any of the tools have been updated since

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,079
i left or like are there still

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,160
discussions about

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,480
uh different tools and et cetera et

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,160
cetera i mean when we move to read the

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,720
docs we do have html

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,560
and pdf and after we got the pdf no one

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,560
has really asked for

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,839
um more as far as i know um

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,839
but i remember that the pdf question was

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,880
um was ongoing when i joined

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,880
cool and next question from

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,400
andy do you have a way to ensure that

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,839
what is the most important

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,640
knee gets addressed first um

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,400
so sophia like i i think i mean i think

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
elephant is obviously very important

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
like

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,000
different like each of the sub projects

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,240
need to have

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,760
a certain level of documentation but do

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,440
you do a prioritization

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,520
uh on what needs to be done or

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
yeah i mean it depends on the audience i

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,160
guess uh

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,160
but you have some like technical

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,160
overview is always super important

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,400
then you can elaborate and go deeper on

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,920
that one the more you advance

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,720
like within the project but you have a

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
technical overview and you need to have

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,079
some kind of getting started with them

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,319
maybe an installation instruction a

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,599
configuration guide and so on

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,240
um but i would say to to try to come up

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,880
with a

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,160
a pretty like narrow structure and then

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,160
you can elaborate on that

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,760
otherwise you will end up having

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,640
multiple documents that you need to

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,440
maintain

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,800
and because you were aiming very high um

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,680
in the beginning but

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,520
you would want people to to get a good

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,839
overview and technical understanding and

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,000
then obviously be able to get started

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,720
um with the product or the project

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,240
yeah at gitlab um this wasn't just for

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
documentation but any

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,160
issues in general we had a way of a

00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,440
couple different ways of highlighting

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,359
important issues that we wanted to

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,000
encourage community members to work on

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,839
is i mean we had one label called

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,920
community challenge if you work on that

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,839
issue with the with an mri gets merged

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,720
you get a nice custom swag i mean from

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,800
get lab

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,640
as i thank you for working on that and

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,359
we also have quarterly hackathons where

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,800
we will list

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,560
like these are the issues that we want

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,480
to encourage people to work on

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,920
uh so that's sort of a fun way of like

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,520
encouraging like a

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,599
you know putting a spotlight on some of

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,800
the issues uh that we want people to

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,560
work on and

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,599
i mean like uh at cube i mean i'm just

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
getting started but

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
that's hopefully the way that we want to

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,760
encourage people to sort of participate

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,319
like when we have a docs focused event

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,000
uh

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,520
and get community members together and

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,200
then we want to highlight you know

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,560
you know we want to get feedback on this

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
or we want you to

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,240
sort of help improve like these

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,280
documentation areas is

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,319
is um it's one of the things that we're

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,319
thinking of doing

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,000
uh but you know it's still early days

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,920
like i haven't really necessarily gone

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,520
through documentation but that's

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,040
um yeah i think there are a couple of

00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,000
different ways that you can sort of put

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,599
a spotlight on

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,040
important things that we want people to

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,800
work on

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,240
and thank you sean and andy like

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,720
hopefully we

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,480
answered your questions but it looks

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,359
like we're out of time

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,359
yeah thank you so much sophia and ray i

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,920
really appreciate your contributions

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,280
today

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,640
i hope you enjoy the rest of the

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:28,880
conference we appreciate you

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:28,880
