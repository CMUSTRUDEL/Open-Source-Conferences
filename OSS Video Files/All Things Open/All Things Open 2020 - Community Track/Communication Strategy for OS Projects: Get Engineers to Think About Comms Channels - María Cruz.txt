Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: In this session, participants will learn how to use a communications logic model, a tool that helps users map out communication channels for any open source project and how they work towards project goals. We will look at application examples for Apache Beam and TensorFlow communities, and how strategic approaches to comms can save contributors time.

thank you so much

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,320
um uh hi everybody and thank you for

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,160
joining this session

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,679
it sounds like it's one of the last ones

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,640
for the day so

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,760
i appreciate your your presence uh and

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
your attention

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,119
um i am maria cruz i'm a product manager

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,240
in the google open source program office

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,920
i added my

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,160
twitter handle here on the slides in

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,560
case you want to tweet about this

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,640
and uh yeah so we can go ahead and get

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,399
started i'm gonna be talking about

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,360
how to in design a communication

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
strategy

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,680
for open source projects or how to get

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
engineers to think about communication

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,719
channels

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,600
so i wanted to start with uh a quote

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
uh from a book that i'm reading uh and

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
i'm

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
sorry because the title is not quite

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,920
right i am missing one part it's called

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,960
uh working in public uh by nadia eggpal

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,960
um and she states that

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
social platforms have really changed the

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
way we make and consume content and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
creators now reach a much bigger

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,840
potential audience but these

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,520
relationships are pleading one-sided and

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
often overwhelming

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,200
and i thought that it was um a good

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
reference to to what i'm going to be

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
diving into i

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
um from my experience working in open

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,280
source

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,119
uh open source projects tend to develop

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
and create a lot of communication

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,720
channels to collaborate

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,560
and work together um and sometimes this

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,000
becomes a little bit of a monster in and

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
of itself

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,640
so let's take a look at uh

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,880
how this collaboration happens online so

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
uh it's very common to have mailing

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
lists uh

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
projects will typically have at least a

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
mailing list for

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,200
developers another for users

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,360
at the verb minimum uh

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,200
other open source projects also have a

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,320
mailing list per interest group

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
per topic per region per language

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
uh there are also a multitude of

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,599
discussion forums

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,720
um this course slack discuss also people

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,040
looking for topics on stack overflow

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
and maybe others that i'm not even aware

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
of

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,200
um events are another

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
avenue for communication uh so

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,519
there can be working group meetings

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,360
conferences community meetups

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,480
and uh other convenings that take place

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,000
um websites sometimes there's more than

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,760
one

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,640
there's usually a a website for the

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
project

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
a website for the conference uh there's

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,319
documentation

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:57,599
there's wiki and there's also

00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,800
uh github and other platforms as well

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
so uh

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,400
this is a lot to take in and how do we

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
make sense of all of this together there

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
are so many

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
communication channels uh how do we

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,840
make sure that all of these

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
communication channels

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,120
are aligned with project goals um

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
this is the the question that i had in

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,400
my mind when i started working

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
uh with the apache bin project and

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
this this is how i'm going to be diving

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
into

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,840
the method so um many times uh

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,400
open source projects dive into building

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,959
multiple channels to collaborate

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,480
um and in at the end of the day

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,480
engineers spend a lot of time

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,519
working to maintain those channels uh

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,400
and sometimes the the result of that is

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,080
not what they expect or is not

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,360
necessarily aligned with

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,799
project goals so in order to understand

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,200
how each of these channels works towards

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
that

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,360
i use the logic model

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,840
the electric model is a very popular

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
tool

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,720
in the nonprofit sector which is the the

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
um

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
the industry that i used to work in

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,320
before i started working for google

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
um and it is very frequently used to

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,000
plan

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
and manage uh activities and programs uh

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
to understand how

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
a a certain investment is working

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
towards a

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,639
unexpected goal um so it helps to see

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
how activities and actions uh work

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,840
towards

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,120
short-term mid-term and long-term

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,479
outcomes

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,400
um so let's look

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,880
at the components um we have the

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,800
at the very bottom the activities and

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
these produce an immediate result which

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
is the output

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
short term outcomes are changes in

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
abilities and knowledge

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
midterm outcomes are changes in behavior

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
practices and policies

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
and long-term outcomes are changes in

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
condition

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,080
culture and or context the logic model

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,720
can be designed in

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,199
two different ways that i'm aware of uh

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
this

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,840
a design of the logic model is called a

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,160
stairway logic model and it's considered

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,520
a stairway to success so you are

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
supposed to read it from the

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,440
bottom to the very top there is a

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,440
different way of creating a logic model

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
which is an actual logic model and it's

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,240
written horizontally

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,039
and it's read from left to right

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,000
so let's see how this is applied to

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,000
communication planning

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
so this here

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,160
is the this is a a lot to take in i

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
don't know

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
if you can see all of this hopefully you

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,000
can

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:03,680
um but this is how i apply this to

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
the channels for apache beam a project

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
so for those of you who are not familiar

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,240
with apache beam

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,840
apache beam is an open source project

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,199
for data streaming um and

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,039
so i was working with them in the second

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,319
half of last year

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,520
and uh what i did first was i

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
um uh i

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
let me actually show you first how i

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,479
changed this for communication

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,960
so instead of activities i rename that

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,080
to

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:42,000
channel and then instead of outputs

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,440
i call this artifact so this is what is

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
generated with through this any given

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,400
channel

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
and then i left the other components the

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,599
same so you can see here

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,400
are short-term outcomes intermediate

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,080
outcomes and long-term goals

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,520
um so at the general level i listed

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,319
all the channels that the project was

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
using

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,280
um this was an interesting exercise

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,960
because i was

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
pretty familiarized with the project

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,759
after a month of working with them

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,720
or two months um and i

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,240
i mapped it out and i i sent this to the

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
mailing list and i said

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
hey i'm doing this this uh study can you

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
tell me

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,000
if this is correct uh am i missing any

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
channels and i actually was

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,080
i i was missing several that i

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,479
i hadn't even considered um which just

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,039
goes to show how much

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,840
effort goes into communicating about a

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,160
project

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,080
so after i had a consensus with the

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
project contributors about

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,160
what were the channels the the other

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,080
important element to them was to

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,680
um clarify

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,879
which channels were managed by a

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,240
the the pmc

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,280
uh which is the the a

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
product management committee uh and

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,639
which ones were

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,240
independently managed and that's a

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,919
governance aspect of

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,199
how a apache organizes projects

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,240
um in any case here are all the

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
communication channels

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,199
at the bottom um and so

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,599
listed right above them are all the

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,800
artifacts that are produced

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,360
with these channels and after creating

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,959
this

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,959
i i listed the

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,919
short term outcomes that are connected

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,519
to each of these

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,440
artifacts so for example writing

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:49,200
about writing a blog

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,920
on the bim some website helps towards

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,959
promotion

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,120
of bim summit which in turn a

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,640
works towards increasing participation

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,720
in beam events

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,320
um and so on and so forth so

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
all of these artifacts need to be

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,040
connected to a short-term outcome

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
which has to be connected in turn to an

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
intermediate

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,080
outcome and a long-term outcome if it's

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,440
not connected

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,600
and you cannot find a connection to that

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,680
and this is why this exercise is

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
valuable what that is showing you is

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
that

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
maybe there isn't really a reason to

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,720
keep

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:33,680
doing this effort and so um

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,279
this um this exercise is very valuable

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
because it's a lot it allows you to

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
identify redundancies

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,200
for example when it comes to beam i

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,800
realized that

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:48,240
a as you can see here the project had

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,040
two different blogging platforms um

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
one on the main website and that and one

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
on the

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,040
beam summit website so do we really need

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
to have

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,839
a two different blogging spaces for the

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,279
project or can we talk about the bin

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,959
they've been summit webs they've been

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,760
summits on

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,079
the bim website blog and maybe drive

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,360
more participation in that way

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,839
on the other hand the exercise also

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,079
allows you to

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,200
um to see what are the gaps so

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,839
if you look on the right side

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
here of this diagram you can see that

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
workshops

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,959
contribute to a very important

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
short-term outcome

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,920
for the project which is a increased

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,399
knowledge on how to contribute to beam

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
so are we actually having enough of

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,360
these

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
opportunities for training enough of

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,399
these workshops or do we need to

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,399
do more of that so um

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
in the process of of designing this

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,200
logic model

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,839
uh one of the the aspects that took

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
longer

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,360
other than identifying all the channels

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
was uh

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,680
coming to an agreement about what were

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,120
the short-term outcomes and the

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,320
intermediate outcomes that we were

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
looking for

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
uh with the with the for this project

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
for apache

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
and so once we had consensus and we

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
understood how each of these are

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,120
connected

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:25,120
uh we were able to to finish this

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:29,839
so let me see i think

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,839
i'm gonna move on to the next slide

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
and this is i wanted to show you how

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
after i created this

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,720
logic framework how i designed the

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,279
strategy based on this because this is

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,279
how

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,519
um in a way it's like the

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,519
the

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,000
the rundown of the things that need to

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
change

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,120
uh to optimize this because if we leave

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
it just that

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
the graphic instance um

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
then all the conclusions are and the

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,800
conclusions are not documented

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,000
and it's not really that useful so

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,440
um this is how i apply this i

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,880
i created the logic model i shared it uh

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
with the community and i explained how

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,560
each

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,160
i explained the same thing that i'm

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
explaining to you now how each channel

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,320
has to be connected to

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,800
an outcome and so on and so forth um

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,440
i identified the redundancies and i

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,440
proposed

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,600
and uh these are these strategies are to

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,440
align the communication efforts

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,160
with the the project the project goals

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
and so in the case of apache beam the

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,440
biggest efforts are

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,480
said to accelerate the conversion

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,800
of beam users to being contributors

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,839
uh and so to this end i explained

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,839
in the appendix

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,200
so these are the three strategies uh

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,800
adding a

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,279
blog post categories frequency and

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,959
distribution develop more in-person and

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
digital workshops

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,120
and increased distribution of tech talks

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,079
and so in the appendix i explain uh the

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,839
reasoning behind

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:27,440
all of these i i knew based on

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,320
some user experience research

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,959
that the main entrance to the project

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,120
was the

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:39,120
apache beam a website and so

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,079
um with this in mind i i proposed

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
a concentrating the blog just on that

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
website

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,160
and talking more about the summit or

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
other events there so that people were

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,120
aware that this were happening

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,880
in the first entry point to the project

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,760
um

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,720
i and so with that we hope that we can

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,320
accelerate

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,680
that's what this green arrow means here

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,360
they step from being aware of a beam

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,839
it's a program to

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,399
a knowing how to use beam

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,399
and then

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,880
the other change that i proposed is

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,240
developing more in-person digital

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,160
workshops and this is how

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:30,320
i used it using the first diagram again

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,440
so i was proposing uh

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,560
driving a this content

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,680
that is a where we show how to

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
how to use beam and how to contribute to

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
the

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,360
website and put it more in front of the

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,560
the new users are accessing the project

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
for the first time

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,800
and so making the documentation more

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,000
more easily accessible

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,920
and putting

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
recorded talks of presentations and

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,760
workshops more available on the website

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
as well

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
um and also creating more opportunities

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
for training

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,120
uh i think

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,240
yes uh going over my notes so i make

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,279
sure that i don't miss anything

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,040
the other important point about

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,040
i'm going to drink some water sorry

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,639
the other important point about how to

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,880
communicate this

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,360
is a creating something that is easy to

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
to process uh and can be used as

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,399
reference

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,240
and so in this case i created this

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,880
double entry table

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,880
where i explain if you have a new tech

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
talk or if you have a training or a blog

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,759
post these are the channels where you

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,600
should be

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,920
talking about this so this can be a

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,120
quick reference for anybody who's

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,360
generating something new and so as

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
as we all know uh open source projects

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
are

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,600
created in collaboration with uh with

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,959
everybody who wants to participate

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
and so um people can be creating a tech

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,880
talk or a presentation

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,160
at any point to explain something so why

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,680
not include that

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,839
in the in the project channels

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
so this is a very quick reference on on

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,480
how to do that

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:26,320
um i think

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,600
yes that's the presentation so this is

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,000
basically how i presented the

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,680
the strategy i have to say that in the

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,199
beginning i had

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,320
a much longer document explaining

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,000
uh in more detail communication concepts

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,240
and all of these things

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,759
and my manner my manager at the time

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,680
lisa lacroix was like

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,880
no we need to present this to engineers

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
this has to be like straight to the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
point

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,839
and that's when i just pointed down to

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,279
do these three things

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,440
and uh this table and i think that was

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:04,160
uh that was very effective and it just

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,079
it it created a very good conversation

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,000
and understanding about why this has to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,520
happen

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,039
um so

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,959
yes the outcomes so the

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,079
the logic model had had a very good

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
reception

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,559
uh as a as a tool i think it just helps

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,039
to

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,319
put everybody on the same page uh and

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,039
understand

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,919
why certain changes need to happen it's

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,360
a very

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,200
instant understanding

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,880
especially when everybody is on board

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
about

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
the the outcomes that we want for the

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
project

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,559
um if there was anything there that

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,919
was subject to discussion or

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,360
disagreement then

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,440
there would have been more conversation

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,760
about it but it was just very clear and

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
straightforward and i think

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,799
the logic model really show it helped to

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,440
show

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,240
um why why those changes need to happen

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
so we implemented this on apache beams

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,679
wiki

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
uh it's a conference wiki as

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
documentation on how to use the project

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,880
communication channels

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
and um their recommendations were used

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
to redesign the apache beam

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,640
website so i think

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,280
that's let me see yes that's uh

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
all the information i had to share about

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,840
this project

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,840
and i wanted to thank you all

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,760
for for joining this session and if you

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,120
have any questions or any comments or

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,120
feedback

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
i would love to to hear them

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
thanks so much maria um i do have one

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,320
question

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,160
um is there a process for eliminating

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
the communication channel or hiding it

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,120
in the event it is duplicated

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,280
um effort or no longer needed

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
is there's a process yeah do you have a

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
process or do you just

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
how do you get rid of a communication

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,039
channel

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
based on the way you have this laid out

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
well

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,120
yeah that's a good question the first

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,400
thing is that you have to

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,120
to talk other people about it and

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
have them agree that it's a good idea to

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
eliminate it

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
um because if there's a communication

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,880
channel there's probably somebody who's

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,400
managing it

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,440
and and who feels uh that there's

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,679
a need to to have it there

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,360
um and so i i think the

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,360
the first step would be to get everybody

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,240
on board and why the changes need to

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
happen

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,280
and then the person who owns it

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,559
usually can shut it down yeah

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,480
but many times there isn't a process

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,160
to open or close and people just take

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,440
initiative to do those things by

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,640
themselves

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,400
um and so sometimes this this is also a

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
good opportunity to write down those

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
processes

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,400
if we're opening a new communication

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,360
channel this is how we do it and this is

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
how

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,720
this is these are the people that need

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
to sign off on this etc etc

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,960
yeah um i agree with michael this is a

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
really nice

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
um stair-step model i really appreciate

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,679
you sharing that

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,159
um we we i think i gleaned a lot from

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,280
that

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
presentation so i appreciate that and

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
then i'm opening the chat now

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,080
to see these yeah we have another

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
question will

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,200
um from will this approach be rolled out

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,200
to other apache projects

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,520
oh that's a good question um well

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,520
i don't know about that i think um

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
that would be interesting i but it

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
really depends on each

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,799
project and what the project governance

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,840
in this case the pmc

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,000
and decides to do i was working

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,039
here i was working very closely with the

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
pmc

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,039
and checking in with them frequently as

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,840
well as communicating to the

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,799
to the entire project community so i

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,440
think it's key to

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,600
to work with them but if you want to

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,919
take it as a model to an apache project

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
that

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,600
you know could benefit from this please

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,600
do

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,960
thank you are there any more questions

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,960
i think so let me see

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
there's a few comments

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,440
is there a process for eliminating

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,799
information okay

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,799
i have another question coming in

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,600
this one is first time i see the logic

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,159
models in it being applied amazing way

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,080
a slightly off-topic question your

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,320
thoughts on applying logic model

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,720
approach to playing personal life for

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,720
career

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,640
uh so what was that did what their

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,799
question for it

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
the question was um what are your

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
thoughts on applying the logic model

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,480
approach to

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,799
planning one's life or your career oh

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
yeah i mean you can do that yeah logic

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,320
models

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,159
uh are a flexible tool and you can do it

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,200
use it for whatever you want i never

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,679
tried

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,400
applying it to my life because i i like

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,919
to be spontaneous

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,200
but but i appreciate people who

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,360
who plan ah carefully yeah um

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,280
i i think that's that can that can work

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,600
out if that if that works for you you

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,039
should

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,240
try and do it awesome we have one coming

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,200
in from matt

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,440
matt says the logic bottle looks useful

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
for some things my team is working on

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,080
any pointers on getting started trying

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,919
to use the model for the first time

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,600
any reasons yes great question

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,520
thank you for asking that so i actually

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,240
learned about this when i was working

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,960
for

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,320
the wikimedia foundation wikimedia is

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,360
the social movement that

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,280
is behind wikipedia and i was working

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,640
for the learning and evaluation

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,919
team who was

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,120
spreading the word evangelizing about

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,760
uh logic models and strategic planning

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,640
for wikimedia programs and and

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,640
activities

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,520
and so i'm gonna share a link with you

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
and you can this is a great resource to

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
start

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,360
this this was created by my manager at

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,000
the time jamie mc and so you can see

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,080
here action logic models and staircase

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,360
logic models these are all applied to

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,600
wikimedia activities but i think that if

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,760
the concept was clear to you

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,679
uh you can definitely um

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,279
here i'm gonna type this as a response

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,279
to your question you can definitely

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,279
read more there as well

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,240
great thank you can you drop it in the

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,159
chat as well for anyone else who may not

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,559
believe it in the q a

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:08,000
let me see old panelists and these

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,000
more on logic models

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,960
there we go awesome thank you for that

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,720
um has another question there is also a

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
lot of confusion in our company

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
between projects because every project

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,640
has different communication channels

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,480
so it becomes more difficult to

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,919
coordinate things slack

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,320
discourse matamos internet and so forth

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,960
so it also really becomes difficult to

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,799
know which

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
channel to use when you want to reach

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,080
people across multiple projects do you

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,600
have any thoughts on this maria

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,600
wow yeah um

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,679
so i think it might be a good idea

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,799
to um create a policy

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,760
uh around uh how which communication

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,799
channels you use

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,880
and and how you use them uh

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,320
and get the different projects to sign

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,080
off on that

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,320
and then uh i i was in a similar

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,320
situation in my previous job because

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
uh at the wikimedia foundation some

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,799
people liked using irc

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,480
um which is a an old

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:21,600
chat system from when

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,080
the berlin wall was still up

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
and so it allowed people to communicate

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,679
over the

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
over the wall but anyway it's a some

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,240
people use

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,840
irc and some other people like using

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,039
slack and other people use google

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,919
hangouts

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,200
um and so from my experience there i

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,720
would say

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,720
having a company-wide policy uh

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,120
really would really help and then you

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,600
can decide we're create we're using this

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,080
platform to communicate across

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,240
and then maybe you have some leads that

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,400
can take messages back to their

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,679
projects that's something that we do in

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,000
my current job there's a person who

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
for example a colleague just launched

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
the

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,320
go developer survey and she was asking

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,720
me can we

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,720
share this with apache lim community

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,880
because apache runs on go

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,159
and so i i would be the connector for

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,640
that so like having

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,000
people of contact for each project might

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
be a good idea as well

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
oh i think you're muted regina

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,799
next one's coming in from heya what's

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,799
the time required to maintain an update

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,400
uh you mean communication channels i

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,440
guess um

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,240
well it depends uh you can also decide

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
this up front

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,440
to some extent um so some projects have

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,480
a policy of for example sending four

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,039
tweets a day

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,120
which can be a lot or sending at least

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,240
one tweet a day

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,919
and so um if you do it as a community

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,360
and as a as a project

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
you can have a process where people

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,440
submit tweets

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,320
and then they get approved and published

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,480
and so that

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,760
lowers the burden on any one person who

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,400
needs to

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
um to create the social media for

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
example

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,840
um i would say really how much time

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,720
depends on on what your goals are

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,600
um usually it's recommended that you

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
tweet

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,679
once a day at least and then

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:35,840
that you can have a blog at least every

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,840
two weeks

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,640
we have a couple of questions from

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,320
michael even though we are starting to

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
use microsoft teams

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,320
i have trouble thinking about how to

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,039
structure channels

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,880
project-based product based team based

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,279
topic based internal only

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,960
internal but cross-team internal

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,640
external

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
once i have that structure it's

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,559
difficult where to put a message

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:16,240
your thoughts on that maria um

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,760
i think uh so i'm not i'm not familiar

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,559
with microsoft teams

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,039
i i haven't had the chance to use it yet

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,000
but i believe it should be able to have

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,399
group chats as well as individual chats

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,399
and so

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,120
honestly it it depends and and

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,919
it depends on like how you're used to

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,440
working in collaboration with others

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,919
uh we tend to have a team chat

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
that is internal and then we we also

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,440
create

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,159
a group chats with external people so

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
that are not

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,000
in our company but our vendors who are

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,640
providing a service

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,679
and we do that on a case-by-case basis

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
whenever there is

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,360
an event for example and they are

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,520
supporting the event we use that chat

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,320
room to communicate with them

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,559
uh and then the chat that chat room goes

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,399
silent because the event is over

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,640
and so while sometimes you can um

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,320
it can feel overwhelming to have a lot

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,039
of chat rooms and this happens

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
to me quite a bit now i'm more used to

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,440
it

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,000
i also i i also really emphasize the

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
this concept of having a policy on how

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
you communicate on those

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,919
chat rooms and and when you attack

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,679
people um because that can really help

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,360
to

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,240
to communicate more efficiently

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,799
when you want people to to pay attention

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
um

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,919
and so you know that on your team group

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,919
you would probably have

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,279
x number of messages and every day

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,039
everybody's sharing what they're working

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,919
on and you will probably read about that

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,679
and then

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:57,200
on on chat rooms are

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,720
created solely for specific events

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,640
you know that it's happening only on

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,399
that day and so

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:07,039
trying to have some some rules around it

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,720
is probably helpful and then with

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,240
regards to

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,480
making them external or non external

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,640
yeah it depends on how you collaborate

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,120
with your team

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
okay well thank you for that um michael

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,159
did um

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,760
elaborate a little bit more on the piece

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,799
around

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,159
this team the challenges of

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,799
collaborating

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,000
when you have an external people so his

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,159
question is

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,360
i collaborate with my team on a project

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,919
related to a product

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,279
sometimes i have to you know engage

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,200
external people

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
so where do you recommend that that type

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,159
of message would go

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,080
where you where you can talk to both the

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,840
internal and the external

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,279
folks about that particular project or

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,919
product so it sounds like maybe you can

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,120
have

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:58,000
uh it sounds like you can have

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,000
a chat room

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:06,159
yes agree michael

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,159
you can get a chat room um

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,000
with your team about the project right

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,600
and that's the segmentation so you have

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,880
team and then within your team the

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
project and that's

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,039
that's the room that you're gonna create

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,960
and then you can have a second one

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,080
where you also include external people

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,360
uh and i think that can help you to to

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,679
organize that

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,120
like i don't know how big your your team

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,919
is but

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,600
if your team is very big then you you

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,640
definitely should go with

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,640
uh with just having the team

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,480
project uh criteria for that chat group

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
uh so that you don't spam everybody else

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,000
who's not on that

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,120
um and and then having a second room

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,720
where you can also

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,919
talk with external people i think

00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,159
that'll be the way to go

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,519
all right well thank you for that yes

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,760
no problem ah

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,960
okay let me see i'm reading thank you

thank you so much philippe and joshua

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,039
i think the logic model is a great tool

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,640
for internal comps and a great way to

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
help quickly capture a communication

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,200
strategy

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,440
seems fabulous for building consensus

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
around communication with community

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,679
