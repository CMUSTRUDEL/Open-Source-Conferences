Abstract: Open Source has been around since the 1990s and has thrived, grown and become mainstream. It is much more well understood around the world. And in 2014 , at OSCON, the term Innersource was coined by Tim O'Reilly and Danese Cooper and people start talking about this and how to do open source inside of a company.

The question is what is similar about the two, what is different, are the same people in a company involved in the two, is Innersource taking the energy away from open source etc. are all fair questions. For the last 4 years, my organization has been practicing both and are involved in both movements, I want to take some time to share our case study with the audience and what it means to them as a developer, as a company and as someone who is an open source enthusiast. The end result should be an understanding of how one company developed both practices, and the challenges and benefits that they experienced.

thank you sophia

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,800
and uh good to talk with all of you i'm

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
speaking to you from raleigh north

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
carolina

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
it's a pity that i cannot be there in

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,760
person

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
and we're all kind of working virtually

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
but we'll make the best of it

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
so the topic that i wanted to talk about

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
is

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
more more and more i think all of you

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
hearing the word

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,360
inner source come into our vocabulary

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,239
in the open source community and all of

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,040
you know

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
a lot about open source and it's been

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
around since

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
say the early 90s so i want to kind of

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,440
dissect the two words

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,280
and share with you what i think are the

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
similarities between

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,840
this new movement called inner source

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
and what we know as open source and also

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
what is some of the differences between

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
these two terms

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,559
and how do they connect together from an

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,080
organizational perspective and other

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,520
uh ways so who am i um

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,320
my name is nitia ruff and i run the open

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,040
source program office at comcast

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,080
and you can follow me on twitter at

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040

nithya.trafficgmail.com

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,920
so a little bit about me um i've been a

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,840
tech woman for a very long time

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,840
i went to a computer science school

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,079
in the 80s and i started as a coder

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
and then moved on to product management

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,520
product marketing strategy

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,240
today i work in the cto office and i

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,159
work on technology strategy

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
i'm really passionate about open

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,600
innovation and i define it as

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
not just innovating inside a company but

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
innovating

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,680
globally like open source does with

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,560
other organizations with other countries

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,520
with other companies and foundations i'm

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,879
a board member of the linux foundation

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,879
board i chair the board i also sit on a

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,200
number of other advisory boards

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
um and i consider myself a bridge

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,879
builder someone who builds bridges

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,080
across company and community because we

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,440
have to work together

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,120
in order to make this successful i'm

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,200
a huge huge uh fan of inclusion

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
we absolutely need to welcome and

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
include everyone

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,720
in our communities in our companies and

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
you have to be an inclusive leader today

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,680
uh to succeed

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,720
let's uh do a little bit about comcast

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,239
we are a media company

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,319
uh we use a lot of technology to connect

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,760
people to moments on tv and moments on

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,000
various form factors and experiences

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
that matter to them

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
we have a number of companies under the

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,800
umbrella of comcast

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
i think most of you know nbc universal

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
um

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,800
also sky which is a company based out of

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
europe in the uk xfinity is the brand

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
through which we deliver

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
internet services and entertainment

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,159
services and comcast business

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,599
delivers all of our services to small

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
medium and large businesses

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
let's start with just recapping what

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
open source

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
means and some of the open source

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
milestones

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
it really all began with people like

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,640
richard stallman

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,080
and community leaders who created gnu

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,799
and the licensed gpl and soon you had

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
lena stervald's release linux under the

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,760
gpl license and

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,920
linux starts becoming widely adopted

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,280
and very soon you start seeing towards

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
the end of the 90s

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
institutions like the open source

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,920
initiative

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,920
which overseas licenses and the linux

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,599
foundation and apache foundation come

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,840
into being

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,200
these foundations really provided kind

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
of a neutral home

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
for people to collaborate and work

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,199
together

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
across companies on common projects and

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,160
common problems

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,720
you also see in the early 2000s the rise

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
of commercial companies based on open

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,440
source like red hat

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,800
and today open source dominates the

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,560
world

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,919
and to me open source uh really began

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,080
to work through the pipe if you will

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
uh a lot of tech renders like sun

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,560
microsystems silicon graphics ibm

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,440
hp were initial adopters of open source

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
then you had

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,960
cloud vendors in the phase 2

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,680
such as google amazon and

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
microsoft azure and then you're starting

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
to see

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
enterprises like comcast who are

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
primarily in the

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
media and entertainment business but now

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,720
becoming software companies

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,880
and creating software around

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
the business that they are in and you

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,240
see capital one

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,199
you see target and home depot

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
and enterprises which are now becoming

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,000
technology and software companies

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,919
you're also seeing a wave of open source

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,160
usage in the government

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
and certainly in verticals and

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
universities

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,520
etc so open source is dominant across

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
the world

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,240
and the two characteristics in my mind

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,039
that make open source unique is

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,160
how open source software is shared with

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,360
others

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,400
it is the license if you will which

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,759
helps you share open source software

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,759
with certain terminology attached to it

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
such as you shall attribute the

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,639
copyright you shall

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
also present the license text

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
you will present the you know source

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
code for the software

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
and then the way it is created the way

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
it's developed

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,800
is very unique as well to me it's

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,800
developed using a very collaborative

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,000
community-based development model

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,080
where people of very different

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,520
interests different countries different

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,880
organizations

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,319
come together and collaborate to produce

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
this software

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,160
so this is a very unique aspect of open

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
source

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,360
where there's transparency there's

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,919
communication

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,880
and there's collaboration to create a

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,360
common software project

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
if you dissect the collaborative

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
development

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,919
model further you notice that it starts

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
with

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,240
a common goal common motivation

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,160
to solve a problem to really uh

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
scratch an itch as they say in open

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,919
source and then you know the project

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,080
establishes governance around how

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
they make decisions how they will do

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,759
code review

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,000
how they will welcome new people into

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,599
the project so it's the culture

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,680
and the decision making of the project

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
and a collaborative development model

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
often includes

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
tools and infrastructure that allow them

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,240
to collaborate

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,360
do code reviews do pull requests do

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
common development you know include

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
comments include history

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,120
and documentation if you will for that

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,440
particular project

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,120
and collaborative development models are

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
very unique in that

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
they have to be very transparent and

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,520
very complete

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,319
in their documentation so that

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,199
new people can come in and just reading

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
the documentation they can know

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,840
where to get involved what the issues

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,599
are and how to start

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,479
contributing communications is another

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,599
big pillar

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,759
of collaborative development open and

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,199
transparent communications

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,800
asynchronous communications through irc

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,039
through chat through mailing lists etc

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,280
and giving people enough time to react

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,360
to the communications

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,080
and there's a saying that if it's not in

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,800
the mailing list then it did not happen

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,840
and that's very true you cannot go off

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
into

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,759
a live meeting and make a decision and

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
not share it with the rest of the

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
community

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
so communications is a very critical

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,599
component of collaborative development

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,959
and the final component i would say is

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,159
architecture

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,800
most open source projects try to be

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
very componentized have a lot of

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,480
interfaces

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,160
and not be this big gigantic monolithic

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,120
mess which is hard to deal with or hard

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,680
to maintain

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,320
or hard to get involved in so to me

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,880
these are

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,360
five very key components that make

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,560
collaborative development in open source

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
such a big success

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,519
so let's contrast that with how internal

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,519
company development traditionally works

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,640
so internal company development

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,760
or proprietary development often is

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
top down there is an objective set at

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
the

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
leadership level or a product manager

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
level as to the product that they're

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
going to make

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
and the requirements are then driven

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,399
through engineering

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,959
almost like a waterfall to get work done

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,959
and teams often are divided into

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,680
divisions and managers

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,480
and they work within their own manager

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
team and

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,040
own budget they don't often work across

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,519
teams so hence what happens is if there

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
is an expert on databases or there is an

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,800
expert on ai

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
in one part of the company there's very

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
little cross

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,120
leverage across the company so you don't

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,839
get

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,320
access to that person only that person's

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,399
team gets access to that person

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
and often in companies and traditional

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,880
development models

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,519
there is no incentive to share or accept

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,399
contributions across the company

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
and repos are very private they're not

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,240
open

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,880
for others to collaborate on

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
and yes they often do proprietary code

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,640
development

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
and people are generally co-located in

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
the same physical

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,720
office so what happens is it's easy to

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,519
get up and talk to somebody

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
and so decisions often are made in the

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
hallway

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,240
and not documented in the form of

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
communication to the rest of the team

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
and

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
sometimes the teams own their entire

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,079
stack

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,399
and they don't share common

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,440
infrastructure components etc

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,120
and so what happens is there's very much

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
of a low reuse of code

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
and there's a great deal of duplicate

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,560
work being done

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,040
and and you know a lot of companies use

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
agile and scrum and devops way of

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,279
working

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,040
it it it works for many companies but

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,440
there are also as you can see

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,399
a number of drawbacks to the internal

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,760
company development model

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,040
so what happens is many companies then

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,560
want to move to um change their

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,959
development model

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,959
they start seeing the benefit of the

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
open source collaborative development

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,880
model

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,920
and they start saying we should probably

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,640
try to adopt this

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,600
inside our company and the reason they

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
want to do this

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,959
is they want to go faster and and if you

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,440
talk to many people they'll say open

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,079
source

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,399
innovates faster than anybody else

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,279
because it kind of benefits from

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
global innovation and anyone can you

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,600
know contribute

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,000
change and improve the code um

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,560
companies also want to break down the

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,880
silos across their divisions

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,480
and across their teams they want to

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,800
encourage more reuse

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
it's it reduces cost for a company if

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,480
you have more reuse of components

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,760
you reduce duplication and you create

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
more common platforms upon which

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,680
teams who are building apps release

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,720
those apps

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,560
and you encourage also especially today

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
in a very coveted world

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
for example at comcast we are all

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
working virtually

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
uh and we'll continue to work virtually

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,680
till june of next year

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,680
and open source practices really help

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,880
remote and

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,160
teams collaborate better and so

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,720
um companies are looking for open source

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,480
as a way to change their development

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
practices

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
and and you can see other benefits here

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,040
it helps you onboard

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,079
new developers because code is all

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,839
documented

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,200
it is visible it's transparent

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
and you really start getting the

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,959
benefits of faster

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,160
and better software development through

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
open source

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
so this is what's driving many companies

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
to look at inner source

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,760
as a means of uh changing the way they

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
develop

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,800
so just as a conclusion of this this

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,360
section

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
everyone's using open source today and

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
to me

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,920
the next wave of open source or next

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,639
wave of change is collaborative

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
development

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,639
inside the company so how did the term

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
inner source get started and there is no

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,199
gap between inner and source

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,040
it's one single word and i think some of

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
you may recognize these two people in

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,760
the picture

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,079
and they have something to do with how

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,920
the term got started

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,240
so companies i think to some extent

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,639
in pockets of the company probably were

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
doing some sharing of code

00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
some collaboration and they were calling

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,480
it enterprise

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
source i know at comcast there were some

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,240
teams that were doing development

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,040
by sharing code across multiple teams

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,760
but the term inner source itself as a

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,560
formal

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,240
and standard term for collaboration

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,360
inside the companies

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,920
started with tim o'reilly uh denise

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,279
cooper

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,480
who's to your left uh tells the story

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,639
that tim o'reilly

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,920
coined this term back in 2001

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,720
and then in 2015 at oscon denise

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,000
announced inner source commons as a

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
foundation

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,680
which would encourage and codify and

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,199
share

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,199
and educate people on the notion of

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,680
inner source

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,360
and you you will find a lot of great

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,800
information on inner source

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,839
um practices patterns

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,720
uh companies that are doing it at

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,959
innersource.org

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,079
so let's look at what's similar between

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,880
the two

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,680
and the icon at the top the green icon

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
is the

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,880
open source initiatives icon and to me

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,040
that stands for open source

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
and the second icon which looks like a

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,680
zebra stripe

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
is the icon that denise and the inner

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,959
source commons created

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,040
to stand for inner source so as you have

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,279
uh probably concluded by now

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
the development model is common across

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,360
the two

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,519
both in inner source and in open source

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,519
we use a highly collaborative

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,639
highly community based development model

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,240
and we work um you know

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,880
very transparently across organizations

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,839
and both of these require culture change

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,720
inside a company

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
we need people's mindsets to change

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,839
especially

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,720
um the very proprietary development

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,519
model

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,839
with separate teams separate budgets has

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,320
to

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
change the incentives have to change

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
there should be

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
leadership and sponsorship for making

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,040
this culture change

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
it's it's a foreign way of working if

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
you will

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
compared to how companies are used to

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,079
work before

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
but the other benefit and the other

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,800
similarity in my mind

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,040
in both of these models is that

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,759
you have better software development

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,880
practices you have better quality code

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,519
you have more reuse less cost

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,560
and code that can be reused again and

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
again

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,759
by others and that's one of the the

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,639
beauties i think of taking the open

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
source model

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,000
and applying it inside companies

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
some of the differences are the

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
motivations for doing

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,199
inner source sometimes are very

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,000
different motivations may be

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
to go faster to do it cheaper inside a

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
company

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,920
or to work on common you know frameworks

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,959
or libraries

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,360
whereas open source often starts with

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,799
a problem a technical problem that they

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,799
want to solve

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
and inner source may be more you know

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,199
organizational challenges that

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,360
that the company is trying to solve

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,319
inner source as we know is inside a

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,520
firewall

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,360
and is often used to develop proprietary

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,480
code that may never see

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,319
open source inner source is also

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,640
not something that you would use for

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,280
every single project in a company

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,120
for example if there is a project that

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,880
only that particular team

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,600
is using or is very nichey and does not

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,799
need to

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,039
really be collaborated on by others

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,799
there is no need to make it into an

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
inner source project

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,559
and a lot of the incentives and the

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,280
management structure

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,919
inside companies really do need to

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,799
change

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,799
in order to encourage collaboration

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,360
instead of judging a manager by

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
how well he or she meets their budgets

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,320
how well they accomplish

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,960
their own goals it may be

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
how well is your project being used by

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,520
others

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,480
how well are you encouraging reuse um

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,240
are you contributing to reducing cost in

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,440
the company are you contributing to

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080
improving

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
uh competency and software development

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,240
practices in a company

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,880
and typically in inner source projects

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,640
you don't use licenses

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
because you're sharing you know inside a

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,000
company you really don't need a license

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,919
to share inside the company

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
so how does inner source get started in

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,960
different companies and i'll share three

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,120
different models

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
and i'll share with you how we started

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,960
it within comcast as well

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,880
the first model is the company starts

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,280
using open source starts working with

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,280
open source and then realizes

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,880
there's so many benefits to the open

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,559
source development model

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
i want to now bring it inside the

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,559
company and start using it inside the

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,840
company

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,919
the second model as you can imagine is

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
they may start with inner source they

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,200
may say i

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,799
i don't know if i want to open source

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
anything right now

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,480
but i have some organizational

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
challenges i want to

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,160
solve i want to break down some silos i

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,240
want to

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,440
encourage reuse i want to encourage

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,679
collaboration

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
so they start with inner source first

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,400
and then

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,559
when they realize how easy it is to

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
collaborate they start realizing the

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,799
benefits and then

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
also inner source code becomes more easy

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,559
to open source

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
and so they start kind of moving towards

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,520
open sourcing their code

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,720
working with open source communities etc

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,960
and then of course there are some

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,440
organizations which kick-start both of

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
them

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,640
at the same time for us um

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
we really started with open source as a

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,600
company and then we moved to

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,000
inner source uh i know that my friend

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,720
guy

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,919
martin when he worked at autodesk he

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,159
would say

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,120
they primarily worked on inner source

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
and then they

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,600
move to open source and then there are a

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,480
number of companies like paypal

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,000
that denise was which did both inner and

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,000
open source at the same time

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,600
so there's there's a school of thought

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,799
there are some people who think

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,600
inner source really kind of is robbing

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,880
the momentum and the movement from open

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,840
source

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,120
and i'm here to say that yes the names

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,080
are different

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
but they both benefit software

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,400
development

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,799
they both i think encourage the same

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
thing

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,159
which is transparency open collaboration

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,600
community-based development

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
it improves i think um how people

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,960
approach

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,559
open source it encourages more people to

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,280
go into open source

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
and frankly especially organizations

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
that are

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,440
concerned about you know jumping right

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,760
into open source

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,960
inner source is a great way to get their

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,120
feet wet

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,679
start learning collaborative development

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,960
and then start moving towards a more

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,000
open source based model so net net

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,960
in my perspective inner source

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,520
is the next wave of open source it's

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,679
also

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,240
a huge positive um encouragement of open

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
source

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,679
and it validates open source way of

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
doing things

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
so how did we get started on on inner

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,039
source

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,360
i'll just give you a brief description

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,559
of our journey

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,240
um around 2000s we started

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,480
you know we were very dependent upon

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
vendors as an enterprise we

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,159
did not do any software development we

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
pretty much bought

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,240
equipment from vendors and we stood it

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,919
up and operated it

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,159
um in around 2006 we started realizing

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,200
that we wanted to do our own software

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,440
development

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
we wanted to be more in control of our

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
own destiny

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,880
we knew our business better and we

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
wanted to start consuming

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,480
uh software and improving the software

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and open source was a perfect place to

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,159
go to because

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,880
the source code was available and it was

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,159
a great starting point and we could then

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,880
improve upon it or build our own stacks

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
on top of it and then we started

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
contributing software

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,320
back into the open source community

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,520
whether it was upstreaming bug fixes and

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,159
patches

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,799
or it was new projects that we had

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,720
created

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,960
and we felt that maybe someone else

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,960
would also benefit from that

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,919
and so we started up a consortium called

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,840
rdk for example where we open source the

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,159
set-top box software

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
we've open sourced a content

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,039
distribution network

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,000
to the apache foundation and today we

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,799
find ourselves

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
doing a lot of external open source but

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,640
we also

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,520
are highly encouraging our development

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
teams

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,840
to collaborate across the company and

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,280
we've started doing inner source

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,600
since 2017.

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,679
and some of the patterns we see or some

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,640
of the motivations for open source

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,760
are for example there's one team that

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,080
said

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,520
we're going to be going open source next

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,480
year but

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,039
we want to set it up as an open source

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,159
project

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,840
inside the company and really practice

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,240
our community development skill sets

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
we want to kind of trial it inside the

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
company

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,360
and if it works then we know we'll be

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
successful in building community

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
once we're out open source so it's a

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,679
great staging

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,320
ground before you go open source the

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,080
second

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,600
is um there was a component that

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,200
you know three or four teams in the

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,919
company used

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
but one team was bearing the burden of

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
maintaining it

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,559
so the other teams that the users would

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,320
just file issues but never really help

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,520
with the development

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,600
so this team which was doing all of the

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,039
burden of development

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,279
opened it up made it a public repo

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,640
put some documentation out there started

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,360
training their users

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,520
and said you are empowered to start

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,600
contributing to this project

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,640
and thereby shared the burden if you

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,720
will of the maintenance of that project

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
it also helped us when two teams were

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,080
developing similar work

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,440
to kind of reduce that duplication and

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,440
also there is one team for example

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,720
that's collapsing five different

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
applications

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,960
into one single application

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
and so it's helping them get all of

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,440
those teams together

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,000
to contribute to one common model if you

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,039
will of a future application

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,360
it's it's really helpful when uh teams

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,080
don't have to wait for the other team to

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,200
respond

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,520
to a request that they've made they can

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,760
start doing a pull request they can

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,400
contribute the change themselves

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,400
and not have to wait for the priorities

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,440
of the other team to change

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,520
in order for their work to get done so

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
we've seen a tremendous number of

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
benefits

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
in doing um inner source we have almost

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,679
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,559
projects that are in our catalogue

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,360
and have advertised that we are open for

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,159
business

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,279
we are open for people to reuse us or to

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,200
collaborate with us

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,760
or contribute to us one way that

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,000
teams are organized for inner source and

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,039
open source inside companies

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,720
is the open source program office like

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,760
the one i run

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,960
can also take on inner source as

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,919
one function and open source is another

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,640
function

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,640
and my team also does a great deal of

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
developer relations and developer

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
advocacy

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,279
so to me it it's a logical fit inside

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,440
the open source program office

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,440
to have a team that's dedicated to

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,080
helping your developers to

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,559
inner source a team that helps with all

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,480
open source questions and matters

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,480
and a team that really focuses on

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,679
developer relations and enabling our

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,919
developers to be successful

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,200
and the three things we measure from an

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,440
inner source perspective

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,520
are how many external contributions does

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,159
a particular team accept

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,799
so for example if team a inside the

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
company

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,120
has opened up their repo to team b c and

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,480
d we want to know that more

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,720
and more of the changes in team

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,360
a are coming from the outside of team a

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
that they're genuinely benefiting from

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,039
collaborative

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,840
development and that not all changes are

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,240
being made by team a

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
we also measure developer productivity

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
and happiness

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,440
but there's no one good way to measure

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
this

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,279
we are looking at things like enps which

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,720
is

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,400
employee net promoter score developer

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,880
experience developer net promoter score

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
is it allowing them to release the

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
cadence of release of the project is it

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,399
speeding up are they able to get more

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,559
work done

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,440
are they able to cover more use cases

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,159
etc

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,399
so all of this really helps us kind of

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,600
get a sense of

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,760
how developers benefit from inner source

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,480
and from collaborating with others

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,000
and and as you can see um it really

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
results in

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,200
better speed of development and better

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,240
scale across the company when you

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
are not duplicating things but you're

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
actually

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,679
taking advantage of components and skill

00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,159
sets and people

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,520
across a huge organization so in my mind

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,760
inner source is a perfect way to start

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,880
getting the benefits of open source

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,760
inside the company

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,120
so i just want to conclude by saying

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,200
it's really the next

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,360
wave of open source inside companies

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
when you find that the whole world is

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,640
has adopted open source

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,840
the next frontier if you will is inside

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
companies

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,120
changing how proprietary development

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,480
models

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,640
are done into a more open source

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,880
transparent more collaborative more

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,320
community oriented way

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,320
and i hope you found this useful

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,440
and i'm happy to answer any questions

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,880
you have

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:51,760
and i'll get out of the full screen mode

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,760
and get into questions

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,080
thank you so much nithia um i'm just

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,559
checking the

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,000
qa and we currently don't have any

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,240
questions in there so i

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
encourage any of the participants if

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,960
they have questions please add them to

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
the qa

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
i'm also looking at the chat and i'm not

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,640
seeing any questions yet

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,200
so just thank you i think that's a good

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,679
one

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,240
um someone commenting on measuring and

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,240
metric

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,840
and i have to say that's also a personal

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,600
interest for me i've been

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,279
working with the chaos group and we're

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,960
constantly thinking about

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,760
how to measure and attribute

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,039
performance and other and other methods

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,159
it's not all about performance and

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,440
creation but

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,520
what are the things that we can look at

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,080
to measure and i think about it a lot in

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
terms of

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,120
also being part of an open source

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,360
program's office

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
once we start instituting measurements

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,240
there's always the consideration of how

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,559
is that going to change behavior

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,679
so are we showcasing the right types of

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,240
things that encourage

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,080
more team collaboration i really like

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,919
that external contributors how many

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
people are actually successfully working

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,840
across silos between teams so

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,159
thank you for sharing that and sharing a

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,600
little bit about how your ospo is run

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,200
i thought that was quite interesting to

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,159
hear yes

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,480
and and uh frankly you know google's

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,600
osbo was one of the first ones

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,720
um that was set up uh christy bono uh

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,520
set that up and uh i worked very closely

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,640
with chris

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,880
and with lots of other oscar leaders in

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
a

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,159
you know in an organization called the

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,760
to do group

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,399
and we tend to share

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,919
our learnings and best practices across

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
the two groups

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,520
there's a really good question from

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,399
jonathan brink on

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,960
the use of trusted committers and i

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,120
think that's a fantastic suggestion

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,840
uh we've been playing with that idea as

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,360
well both for external contributions

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,399
jonathan where

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,440
we want to reward people who have

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,000
done a good job of you know following

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,919
the practices best practices if you will

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,960
from a contribution perspective

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,880
and we make sure that they are um given

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,279
the respect that they deserve they go

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,480
they have a faster track if you will to

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,120
contribution

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,159
and even inside for inner source we we

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,159
are playing with the

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,000
notion of trusted committers you know

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,640
certainty certain members

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,640
have earned the right to um you know

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,600
contribute to each other's projects

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,080
and they're doing things right so we're

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,120
doing

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,600
that thank you again for

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,320
your comment on the wooden craft behind

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,919
me

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,320
um it's a fantastic wooden carving

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:37,360
made in my hometown of bangalore india

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,640
and it's one of my favorite favorite

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,039
pictures it's it's the life of krishna

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,240
many different aspects of the life of

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,679
krishna

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,679
so it looks like we have another

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,840
question that popped up in the qa

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,279
from wolfgang and if you're looking at

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,519
if i can read it to you in case

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,039
that's difficult to find um can you

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,600
please elaborate a bit

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,120
on developer happiness as a metric or

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,440
measurement

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
that's such a great question wolfgang

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,679
thank you so much

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,080
um so as a company we've been doing a

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,320
lot of enps measurements which is

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,760
employee net promoter score

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,640
um so once a quarter we measure how

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,120
employees are doing are they happy are

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,320
there

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,600
areas that they are concerned about

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,200
and so what we as a software development

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,080
team and open source team we're thinking

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,840
of doing is

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,840
adding questions to the enps

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,840
to ask for since you adopted

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,320
you know inner source has that

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,080
reduced the friction in your work or has

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,360
that speeded up your development

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,000
or has that helped you collaborate

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,720
better

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,399
or get work done better so we are still

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,919
playing with some of those

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,720
um types of measurements we've also been

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,200
looking at

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,200
of course you know traditional surveys

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,799
uh to reach out to teams

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
to say um you know i i see that you've

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,399
been

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,600
using inner source for the last year how

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,600
is this practice working out for you and

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,799
get more qualitative information

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,600
you know from from that perspective um

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,440
it's it's not easy and and i'd be very

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,360
curious wolfgang and also

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,519
everybody else if you have any

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,399
suggestions for how we can do a better

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,480
job of measuring developer happiness

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,720
i would love to get your perspectives on

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
that

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,279
thank you nithya we have a second

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,600
question from mauricio

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,760
how do you avoid projects from becoming

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,679
tied to your internal models

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,559
do you have documentation with

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,399
guidelines on how to write united code

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:52,320
united in quotation marks or untied code

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:55,679
oh my goodness yeah

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,080
um we what we've done is we've uh

00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,080
provided a checklist of best practices

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,519
for people who are starting an inner

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,880
source project

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,240
and we then audit those projects also to

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,079
make sure that they

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,280
are following those best practices um

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
we are trying to get them to architect

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,000
the projects differently

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,520
you know more modular more componentized

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,919
document it better have a very set

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,240
governance rules for how code is

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,879
reviewed how code is approved

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,599
um so hopefully those types of things

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,679
are

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,440
you know helping us i haven't seen too

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,040
many projects become

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,800
tied to the traditional model mauritius

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,119
at least the ones that have adopted

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,159
inner source and kind of are badged as

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,599
inner source they

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,760
they seem to follow um the um

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,879
you know the things that we've uh

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,399
provided to them

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,399
the the checklist if you will

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,960
it's a good question i we think about

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,440
that a lot at google as well and i think

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,200
the models are more similar than the

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
tooling i think that's where we run into

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,320
some trouble

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,520
um when they're you're trying to bring a

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,920
project into

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,520
an external forum um you don't have the

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,839
same tools accessible that we have

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,440
internally for google engineer so

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,400
there's either the choice to write

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,839
completely using external tooling which

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,000
a lot of our projects do

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,440
the ones that are already and published

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,760
in open source forums but

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,960
the projects that we want to externalize

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,920
and bring out there

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,079
there is a bit of a transition period

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,800
between not just the model itself

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
but the tooling around it how even code

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,839
is released let's say we use

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
garrett in a lot of these forms but

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,920
maybe you weren't using that in another

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,599
place so

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,079
how do you transition to a model that's

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,160
now accessible to external contributors

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,520
and i feel like that probably could also

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,880
come into play

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,800
absolutely and and certain language and

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,480
certain communities have certain norms

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,760
to your point sofia

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,400
and so we have to do a lot of thought

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,720
about

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,640
does the license match what the java

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
community uses or

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,839
do the tools match what that community

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,880
uses and

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,920
where does the community congregate and

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,599
how do we

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,280
kind of you know post our project there

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,560
so very very good point um let's see

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,200
if there are no other questions

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,320
i'm happy to take on any other questions

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,160
or

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:30,720
to clear the floor for my uh

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,720
fellow speaker okay by the way we do

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,720
have an inner source license because we

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,359
are a multinational company

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,760
consisting of yes i i thought about

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,440
wolfgang's model so his question is

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,680
we do have an inner source license

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,920
because we're a multinational company

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,599
consisting of many legal entities so it

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,000
seemed like a good idea

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,839
this does however make the inner source

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,119
to open source staging a bit more

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,079
difficult

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,240
yes so wolfgang is a fellow member of

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,720
the inner source common summit

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,400
um and i remember you mentioning that

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,280
there wolfgang essentially what

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,280
what he's talking about is if an

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,079
umbrella company like alphabet for

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,240
example

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,440
and there are multiple entities under

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,920
alphabet

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,960
google being one and you know so on and

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,240
so forth

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:20,160
then cross entity they're separate legal

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,680
entities under the same umbrella

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,200
so they have to license across

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,400
those entities for us for example sky

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,599
and comcast if i create something here

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,960
i may need to cross license

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,000
to um sky one of the things we're doing

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,200
to avoid that

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,920
wolfgang is we're just open sourcing

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,880
something and then skye becomes just

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,520
another

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,320
member of that open source community and

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
thereby

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
and and clearly not everything can be

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,000
open sourced but

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,680
that's helped us solve the problem in

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,280
cross entity

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,280
uh collaboration if you will

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
thank you that was interesting for me to

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,839
hear as well

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
okay

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800
thank you mauricio appreciate it thank

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
you

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,960
still have five minutes um i'll stick

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,960
around for a few more minutes

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,280
and then we'll transition to the next

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,240
track in preparation

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,359
wow i thought i i would take too long so

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,480
i just kind of

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,480
breathe through the material right

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,079
everyone's been ending a bit earlier i

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,359
think it's it's kind of

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,760
wonderful because then we have this

00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:02,480
space to just digest and

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,480
discuss so i've been enjoying the breaks

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,480
we have another comment thank you

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,240
um i appreciated the ending on metrics

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,040
too again i've been working with chaos

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,440
we talk a lot about metrics um and i

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,839
think

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,079
especially as someone who works in an

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,839
ospo and then works with chaos there's

00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,440
we're constantly having questions around

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,200
how we're thinking about measuring

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,280
community projects and community health

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,960
but also how are you measuring

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,400
internally in terms of what we care

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,000
about and whether or not

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,680
we're being productive as an

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,599
organization and

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,800
because we're kind of a service entity

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,440
within our company

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,440
we're in helping people to engage in

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,480
these communities in a compliant

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,839
way licensing being at the root of that

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,520
so that we are using everything

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,000
appropriately and contributing back

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,280
and re-opening things back appropriately

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,040
so there's a lot of

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,200
automation and linting checks that we

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,079
run across our compliance team

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,560
but it's measurement is key to all of

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,640
that

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,560
in terms of keeping track of what we do

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,319
and whether or not we are

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
we are focusing on the right things and

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,440
especially revealing for

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,119
us within ospo are we providing the

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,839
right services the right

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,920
kinds of incentives and feedback so that

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,280
our teams can continue to be productive

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,319
internally

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,480
you hit it on the nail uh sofia um

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,520
that's exactly what i worry about too

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,680
i worry about is the oscar itself being

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,520
effective and efficient and making an

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
impact positive impact right on the

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,680
company

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,520
and then is compliance are we doing it

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,880
right and where are there gaps and how

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,480
do we improve that

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,319
and then of course there's the external

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
side which community should we get

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,079
involved in

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,000
how do we contribute so there's the

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,480
oscar effectiveness of the external

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,680
there's the internal and and and

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,240
incentives can

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
go wrong and it can create the wrong

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,040
behaviors as you point out

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,599
we are very involved or at least

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,119
periodically we check in with chaos and

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,040
try to understand how that's going

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,200
jonathan says going a bit further

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,000
regarding trusted committers

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,560
any thoughts on having dedicated tcs who

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,359
serve as the only gateway to getting

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,560
code pushed perhaps having a dedicated

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,480
tc per sprint

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,640
and passing that role around to a few

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,760
people are there any companies that are

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,920
following this model

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,200
for example in garrett only granting the

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,280
tc the power

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,400
to a plus two um in a previous company i

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,119
worked for

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,119
we did have a trusted committer and he

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,359
was the only person through which we

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,720
made any upstream changes

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,359
or any code changes to ceph which was

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,040
the project that we were contributing to

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,839
um we just felt that this person could

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,760
oversee and make sure that the code was

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,800
created correctly it was the right thing

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,280
to do

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,720
and he or she knew the process for

00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,400
getting legal approval

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,920
and you know knew how to do it right so

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,480
this was the person through which we

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,400
went through the to the project

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,920
i think we're doing that in a few other

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,200
places where we have

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,200
a lot of people contributing to um

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
the same project we are trying to funnel

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,800
it through

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,800
one or two main trusted committers

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,960
um thank you for that we do have one

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,480
more question that popped up

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,400
uh in the qa from mauricio again

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,160
since we still have time does comcast

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,160
have something like a github

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,440
enterprise space where all the public

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,880
code is shared

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,359
and yes mauricio we are standardized on

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,720
github

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,680
enterprise so um which makes it really

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,880
really easy

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,480
to um kind of encourage open source

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,000
collaboration inside the company there

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,440
are pockets of the company that are

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
using other

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
uh solutions like gitlab and other

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,760
things

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,680
but predominantly get a github

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
enterprise is the way we collaborate

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,640
inside

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,640
the company

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,560
okay oh i had one more question for you

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,680
i know it's like a minute and we're

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,520
shoving it in but you're

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,000
you are part of the to-do group as well

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,920
and i was reviewing the last round of

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,880
the 2020 survey and one of the questions

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,920
was how are

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,960
ospos rating their own success and the

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,160
top rated thing

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,000
was open source culture and i'm

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,680
in my head i was thinking is that apply

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,119
to an inner source model but

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,040
i was kind of curious to get your

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,760
thoughts if you had any sort of

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,240
background on

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,640
what was intended by that question or

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,560
how you viewed it

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,520
uh how do you con could you repeat that

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
again please um

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,839
how ospos measure their success um and

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,520
then the top

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,720
response was open source culture within

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,160
the company

00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,000
um the second being developer

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,839
productivity so i was just kind of

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,720
curious if you had thoughts on measuring

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,000
culture

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,359
and whether or not something like the

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,280
things you've talked about around inner

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,880
source are part of that

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,520
to me um yes so one of the things we

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,800
look at

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,280
and and it's probably in um

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,880
not a very exact science but we have a

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,079
slack channel for open source for

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,599
example

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,680
so we measure is is the number of people

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,960
joining the slack channel increasing

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,079
over the years

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,480
right and we've had we went from three

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,160
four years ago with 10 15 people to

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,880
thousands of people now

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,319
on the channel and we look at how

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,079
engaged are people

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,240
um we sometimes hardly ever have to

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,800
answer questions as the oscar

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,560
because there's so many enthusiasts and

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,400
ambassadors in the company

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,960
who'll jump in and answer questions for

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,599
each other so i think that's a measure

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,280
the adoption of open source programs

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,720
that we have

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,200
whether it's inner source or

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,119
other practices inside the company i

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,000
look at that and say

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,400
how widely are we attracting developers

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
to

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,599
you know work in this way how many

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:13,280
contributions do we make as a company

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,880
is another way i look at success

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,599
um and frankly when we do

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,680
talks when we encourage people to do

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,160
talks in open source conferences we are

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,200
seeing

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:28,640
such an uptick now of attendance

00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,119
and um it's seen as a huge positive

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,680
frankly it also helps us recruit better

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,680
when people know that we are a company

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,800
that encourages open source

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,839
and support open source practices

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,240
um in fact yeah it

00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,839
all of these things is things that i

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,839
