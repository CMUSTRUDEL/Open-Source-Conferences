	Presented by: Francesca Marano, Yoast
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: Why do people contribute to the open source projects? If youâ€™ve ever wondered this but never gotten involved before, you might want to know the value of spending time contributing to one.

All contributors do it for the greater good -- making the web a better place -- but we also do it for ourselves: to advance personally and professionally.

In less than five years Francesca went from being a small-town website maker to landing a dream job in tech and leading two releases of WordPress. In this talk, she will share some of the benefits you can get by contributing to open source, such as improved skills, increased reputation, and meeting new people.

my name is francesca marano

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,639
and i'm the wordpress core team lead at

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,160
yoast where we believe

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
seo is for everyone we also believe in

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
open source

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,320
we strongly believe in giving back to

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
the community

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
and in our view that means giving back

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,119
to the place we live in together

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,400
so that's what my team does we

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
contribute full-time to

00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,880
wordpress.org the open source uh

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
project and in case you're not familiar

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,200
with our product

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,920
uh we have an seo plugin and other

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
plugins always focused on content and

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
seo and you

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,600
can visit yoast.com where you can read

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,199
all about our plugins

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,199
and we work with different communities

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,840
and platforms not just wordpress but

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,120
also magento type 3

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
neos and drupal so

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
i am an accidental open source

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
contributor my

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:09,680
path to open source was

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,040
just kind of happened randomly

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,119
uh i was born into tech my parents

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,159
started programming in the late 60s

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,360
so i grew up around computers and

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,000
programming and driving and then drawing

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,960
on perforated cards and all that kind of

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
stuff

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
but i never wanted to pursue a career in

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,600
programming because

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,520
maybe because in my mind everything that

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,520
had to do with that word was

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,200
large mainframes for banks and

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
insurances and

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,479
that wasn't really my thing and then in

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,799
20 uh

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:54,079
my son was born in 2006 so around 2008

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,640
i stumbled upon wordpress.org when i

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,680
wanted to create my mommy blog

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,240
i thought that as a new mom of course as

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
you do

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,439
i needed to knit all of my kid

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,719
clothes and prepare all the food from

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,200
scratch so

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,319
the blog was a place to document that

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,920
turns out my son hated wool

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,959
and i am really not much of a cook so

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,879
um soon after i started it

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
i decided that it was a lot more

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,080
interesting to tweak

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,280
and play with the platform than really

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,040
writing about the latest

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,959
fruit smoothie i gave him and

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,599
a few years before um i

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,680
almost finished a degree in arts and

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
multimedia so with the

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,560
that technical knowledge that

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,680
programming knowledge i started

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,239
uh tinkering with my website and very

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,440
surprisingly people started asking me to

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,319
create similar uh blogs and websites for

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,879
them so that's how my business started

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
um so i loved wordpress i love the

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,920
freedom that it allowed

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
me and i kept up with uh what was going

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
on

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
in terms of the software to be ready to

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,680
learn more

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,680
and to give a better service to my

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
customers but i never thought about

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,720
contributing because

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,000
uh to wordpress or open source in

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,519
general because again

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,959
in my mind development is major

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,040
mainframes for a large organization so

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
i always thought that that's what open

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,239
source needed php

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,519
developers right

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,920
turns out i was wrong so let's

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
have a quick look at my path i'm not

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,799
super fond of talking about me but this

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
in this specific uh case it's really

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,120
about how

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,760
i went from stumbling upon a project

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,159
by writing recipes for kids to

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,239
leading a team of developers that work

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
on that so i did my first contribution

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
without knowing it

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
a client of mine needed a wordpress

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,560
plugin and

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
i translated it so i thought well i did

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
the work so i just sent the

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,359
mo and profiles to the developers

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,160
because the translations was done so

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,840
why not they could you know just use it

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,639
if they wanted to

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
in 2015 i got to know a few wordpress

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,320
contributors

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
at a non-wordpress related event and

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,120
they

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,040
explained to me that actually there was

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
an organized way

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,600
to help the project in many different

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
ways and not only development

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
so i first started translating wordpress

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,960
into italian which is my language

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,639
and then i moved into community uh which

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
is the community team of the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
wordpress.org project this

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
is the team that oversees and supports

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,880
all official wordpress events around the

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,440
world and now online

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
in 2017 i was hired by saigran who's

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,479
also sponsored here today and it's a

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,160
it's the largest independent uh managed

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,080
wordpress hosting company in the world

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
and i joined as the wordpress community

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
manager

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
so joining a company that support its

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
employees

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
in open source contribution allowed me

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,280
to dedicate more time

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,479
to wordpress last year in august 2019

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,520
i became involved with the core team

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,160
and i had the immense pleasure and honor

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
to

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,000
be the release coordinator so one of the

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,199
colleagues of wordpress 5.3 and 5.4

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,240
uh and i stuck around started working

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,199
uh with the core team in a project

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,160
management facility if you want

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,680
and then at the beginning of october so

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,080
very very recently i joined yoast

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
yoast is based in the netherlands and

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
it's a company that always supported

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,160
wordpress

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,039
in many different ways and many

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,039
employees of the company and the founder

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,600
himself have been contributing to it for

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,240
years

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
uh we think we were talking about this a

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
few

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
days ago and the yoast the man not the

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,720
company is basically

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
been part of over 20 uh 20 uh wordpress

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
releases

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,199
so the company and the people at the

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
company are very involved

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
and this summer they decided uh to put

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,319
together a formal team

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
of full-time contributors and i was

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,720
asked

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,360
to lead it so my work for the rest

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,280
of this year will be mostly behind the

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
scenes it's where i like to be

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
and where i'm comfortable with my team

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,400
so we can become

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,680
more effective and helpful in this

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,639
uh path of contribution and

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
also in mentoring other contributors

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,199
that are starting uh

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,400
in wordpress right now or they started

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
contributing

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,720
uh with a focus on women that joined

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,759
the project or have become more active

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
recently

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
in the project because the next major

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
release of wordpress wordpress 5.6 who

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,199
will be out

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,960
in december is going to be led by a team

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
of women and i think it's kind of the

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
first

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,240
in open source so i'm uh i'm very lucky

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,440
because i get to work

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,120
with all these amazing women that have

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,639
uh great ideas and bring a whole new

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,759
perspective to the table so

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
let's uh that was about me and it was a

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,080
little

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
bit about my background so you know why

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,160
i'm here today talking about this

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
so let's dive into open source

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,520
contribution and why i think it's okay

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,840
to be selfish

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,840
so this booklet it's really really

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,560
small the cathedral and the bazaar by

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,319
eric s

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,759
raymond is still after almost 30 years

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,120
a must read for everyone working inside

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,199
open source

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
and i don't know if you have read it

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
this would be the time

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,680
at an in-person event where i would ask

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
you if you read it

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,560
but now i cannot see your reply but we

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
can discuss it

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
afterwards so if you haven't read it i

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,039
really

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
recommend you do so as you see it's very

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
short and

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,319
it's printed very large thanks holy

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,360
because i'm becoming short-sighted

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,599
and it's full of wisdom and it's full of

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,759
things that are still very relevant um

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,399
a lot of years later um i

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
got this printed on demand uh because

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
the original

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
cannot be purchased anymore uh but you

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,159
can also

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,399
uh check it online so it's very

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,880
convenient so it's divided in lessons

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,440
and i want to focus on two especially

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
so the lesson one is probably the most

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
known

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,720
uh sentence from the book

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,080
um and it's

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,240
quite the starting point for uh nearly

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,320
every contributor i know so

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
every good work of software starts by

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
scratching and developers each

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
uh i would like to say not only a

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,040
developer search of course the book is

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,600
written by a developer point of view but

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,279
i think every contribution really starts

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,560
by us as contributors scratching our own

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,160
each that can be

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,720
anything so you need to start somewhere

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,800
right and starting from something that

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
you need a solution for is a great

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,519
idea it might be something that puzzles

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,080
you or something that you need to solve

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,240
to move

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,160
forward with your own project or maybe

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,279
you want to learn about something

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,200
and you can learn by doing and lesson

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,880
number 18

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,519
is corollary to the first one to solve

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,160
an interesting problem start by finding

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,240
a problem that is interesting to you

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,440
so what is your interest so basically

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,760
these two lessons make it clear

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
that you are the master of your own

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
contributor

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
destiny and you should pick projects

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,920
that are

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,959
interesting for you and you're excited

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,000
about fixing and diving into so

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,279
yes be selfish and don't be sorry about

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
it

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,680
if you pick something you use daily it

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
will be easier to get started

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
you can report a bug if you find

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
something unusual you can

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
fix a bug and then if you fix it for

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
yourself

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,480
why not giving it back to the project

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,519
or maybe you attended an online event

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,839
like this one and you decided that

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,920
it would be great to become an organizer

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
of the next edition this is what my

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,519
background is about you can see work in

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
vitalia

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,839
it's a wordpress event that was held

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
this weekend and i was one of the

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
organizers and i've been

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,079
volunteering to organize world camps in

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,640
torino my hometown for

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,560
years now and also don't worry about

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,720
making small changes because

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,160
i started by translating

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,000
every instance i could find of the names

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,519
of the days of the week

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,880
from english to italian it might sound

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,040
meaningless but those words needed to be

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,920
translated they were still in english

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
and i had the time to do it so i did it

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
and then i moved on to more complex

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,920
translations and then i also moved teams

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,279
but i needed that simple thing

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,440
that easy win to get me started and get

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,640
me motivated

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
and also don't worry if you're not into

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,200
the next step

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:42,720
it's fine do what you want because

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,040
it's about you but if you do enjoy it

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
the next step might be getting involved

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,160
more

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,920
actively and continuously with your

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
project of choice

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,519
uh that's usually the point where you

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,200
realize what an impact

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,279
doing small changes have in this larger

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
project and that usually there are some

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
form of

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,959
coordinated communications so people can

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,360
work

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,120
together on the same project so in

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
wordpress for example

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
there are blogs for the different teams

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,240
uh we also slack for

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,279
communications and track and github

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,360
for development and bug tracking

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
so you can start attending chats or

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,279
calls if this

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
specific project has them and even as a

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,760
listener

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,040
at first and then when you feel ready

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,959
to to say your piece or when something

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
is important enough for you to say your

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,680
piece then that's when you

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,880
start connect with others

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,920
and don't forget to be polite and

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
i know it might sound a bit concerning

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,720
of me to say so

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,200
since i assume we're all adults here

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,800
but this will make it so much easier for

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,320
you

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,240
to to go into your path

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,680
and also um you always have to remember

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,000
that usually an open source project no

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,399
matter

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
how large or small it is it's made of

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,839
people from all over the world the

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,320
different cultures different countries

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,440
different languages so you know you

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,360
never

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,079
know uh how they can interpret what you

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
say so go

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,240
into it with an open mind and a

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,600
listening and learning mode

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,920
usually helps so

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,160
on the way on this path you will

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,639
probably learn a lot of things

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,760
for example you lose tools that maybe

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,519
you've never heard of

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,440
on your day job uh or you'll start using

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
procedures and processes

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
that you've never heard of before for

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
example i was introduced to the idea of

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
stand-ups and check-ins and all this

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
kind of things and slack and whatever

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,959
when i started working in the wordpress

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,120
project

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,480
english is not my first language in fact

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,279
it's my third language

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
and i improved my english a lot over the

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,240
years

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,360
thanks to communicating with other

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
wordpress contributors

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,320
and you know that helped me grow as a

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,240
person and as a professional

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,880
and also i learned probably the two

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
most useful skills i learned are

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
conflict resolution

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,320
and project management i became more

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
more assertive and patient along the way

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
and

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
i learned how to delegate and mentor and

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,320
honestly this has helped me a lot

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
in my day-to-day life not just in being

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,880
a wordpress contributor and the results

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,320
are tangibles

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,160
so for individuals uh you get

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,399
new knowledge knowledge is very

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,000
expensive today to acquire

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,880
even though the internet is free so

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
it's a great way to to get to know new

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
things

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,320
from experts in the field you make new

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,880
connections they can become

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,839
business partnerships or friendships and

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,079
both are equally important in our lives

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,800
and you can spot new opportunities for

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,040
your professional advancement

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
so this for example are the 18 teams

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,519
that make wordpress the platform but

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
also the community if you go to

00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,320
make.wordpress.org

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
you'll see all of them and they

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,480
represent an incredible variety of

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
skills and knowledge by contributing to

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
them

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
you can learn anything from putting

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800
together

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
a lesson plan for training wordpress

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,720
users in the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,519
training team to experiment with the

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
latest

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,519
technologies in core or plugins or

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,160
themes

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,160
or you can improve your public speaking

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,560
skills

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:50,000
you can lend a hand in uh translations

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:53,279
uh you can learn how to edit videos

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,199
there's really really a lot to do and a

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,839
lot to learn

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,000
and this is true also for companies so

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,519
by making wordpress better if your

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,839
company will be involved

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
in a project so for example by making

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,199
wordpress better

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,519
the companies in the ecosystem can make

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,079
their own product better

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,120
and make sure that the platform itself

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,040
keeps improving

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,680
so it's a two-way relationship

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,279
and you can have discussions with

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
like-minded people from

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,440
other companies and again exchange

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,720
knowledge which is a very

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,000
uh very precious thing

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,839
to have nowadays and you can use it to

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,560
train up your

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,720
employees for example on the platform by

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,360
allowing them to work on it and provide

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,680
support and guidance for example

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
as soon as i joined the host we had to

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
put together

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,500
a temporary team to tackle um

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,560
an urgent matter in wordpress and

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,800
[Music]

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,120
one of the people that was added to my

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,399
team is a very

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,799
very expert react developer but

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,559
he didn't know much about wordpress as

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,439
other people do

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,799
in the same team so we're getting kind

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,760
of a crash course

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,679
into wordpress and in return we got a

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,319
bit of a crash course

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,039
on react and how react is used on

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
wordpress

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,839
so that was great now we have one more

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,400
person that knows what wordpress is at

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
yoast

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
and the people that work on wordpress

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,280
all the time know a little bit more

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,400
about react

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,080
so it's a win-win uh and finally you can

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,720
get also some recognition

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,360
some open source softwares wordpress

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,559
included

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,600
have ways to highlight companies

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,600
contributing efforts for example in

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
wordpress we have the fight for the

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,280
future

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,640
initiative which encourages uh

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,960
organizations to contribute five percent

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,160
of their resources back to wordpress

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
development

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,559
matt mullenweg who's the work the

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,919
project co-founder and

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,400
lead proposed this as a benchmark uh

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,200
to maintain a kind of a golden ratio of

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,039
contributors to users inside the project

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,960
so the idea is to give back at least

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,559
five percent of your company resources

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,840
to wordpress

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,520
and i'm very proud of this because uh

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,559
even though uh yoast is a relatively

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,120
small company

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
in the ecosystem with a little bit over

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,520
100 employees

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,880
with other companies having well over a

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
thousand people

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,799
we're the second largest contributor to

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,799
wordpress in terms of howard donated

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,039
and so this makes me incredibly proud

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,160
and this was one of the reasons why

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,240
i joined the company as well so i told

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,799
you about being selfish

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,039
but when i started contributing everyone

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,240
was going on and on and on about being

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,039
selfless for me the word

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,840
selfless and selflessness are

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,559
problematic

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,960
mainly because i'm not an english native

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,480
speaker so they're also kind of hard for

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,080
me to say

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,559
but that less at the end sounds like

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
you're

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,880
erasing yourself in the process but

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,160
you're actually the biggest

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
resource in this part process uh of

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,120
contributing so i prefer

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,799
words like generosity or altruism

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,240
so this is where contributing to open

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,919
source becomes about the others

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,000
i and i see this in a lot of

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,840
contributors at first

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,640
we learn we do we attend we have this

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,039
appetite for doing it all we have this

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
need

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,240
for doing it all and to learn and to

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,799
give feedback and to get feedback

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,760
and then a lot of people move into the

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,160
background

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,280
and start helping others go through that

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
first step of

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,640
stepping up and this is how you make

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
sure

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,520
the project has new energies

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,200
so it doesn't die down with people that

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,960
have been doing this for a while and

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,919
might be tired

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
so we go back to eric raymond and lesson

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,000
five

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,039
uh that is both about being selfish

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,159
and so when you lose interest in a

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
program

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,360
you're being selfish your last duty is

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,880
to

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,400
hand it off to a competent successor so

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,400
if something doesn't interest you

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,880
anymore you give it away

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,679
but you're also helpful because you're

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,600
thinking of

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,120
who is coming after you and you're

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,559
putting them in the best

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,440
possible place to succeed

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,480
here are some examples from my

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
experience of

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,919
how i was both selfish and generous

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,240
in different contributions in my life

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,640
not only in wordpress so i get as i say

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,080
they get to mentor new contributors

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,320
which is incredibly rewarding and

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,400
i get to help people that want to start

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
with public speaking

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,559
other people before me help me to get

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,280
there and to get where i am

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,760
uh so i'm happy i can assist other

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,559
people

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,320
in their path uh another example is

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,360
seven years ago i founded

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,400
a very popular blog again by accident

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,240
my life is a series of um

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,440
very very happy accidents apparently

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,400
so i founded this quite popular

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,000
blog for italian female creative

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,039
entrepreneurs there was nothing like

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,360
disney 37 years ago and it's read by

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,280
thousands of people and still today

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,280
people tell me how useful that was when

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,559
they started out

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,320
and last year it became very clear that

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
i couldn't spend more time

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,120
on it i didn't have more time to spend

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,240
on it so instead of letting it die

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,520
a slow and painful death um

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,080
i was able to hand it over to some

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,720
great successor and that was possible

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,520
because i was selfish when i created it

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
and i was generous when i hand it over i

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,799
learned to delegate i was one of those

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,840
horrible people that

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,919
uh thinks that no one is doing enough

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,880
that i'm the only one working i'm the

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,640
only one doing

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,440
stuff and turned out i was actually

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
the problem i was doing too much and i

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,400
was holding

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
everyone including myself to

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,960
unsustainable

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,280
standards so now i'm more selfish i

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,200
delegate instead of working 16 hours by

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
myself i work eight hours and i let

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
someone else

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,600
do the other eight hours and the most

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,280
selfish thing

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,440
i do in life is document

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
so in case i lose interest someone can

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
take

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,720
care of all these projects and for me

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
documentation is actually the highest

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,840
form of generosity

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,480
in contribution in my opinion

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,280
so after five years of solid

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,679
contribution i still think there is

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
what's in it for me it's a major drive

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
to succeed in

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,039
long-term contributions knowing what

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,159
you're getting back

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,520
uh is a major motivator so

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,799
and it's not necessarily profit driven

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,960
or about raising your own profile

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,640
so for example it's the sense of

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,840
accomplishment and pride

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
you feel when you make a change i think

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,520
it's still

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,760
a big mood and answer the worse

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
my day is going the more i turn to

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,200
contributing

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,440
to feel that i'm making a difference for

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,760
millions of people or even just for one

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,120
person it actually doesn't matter

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,240
so that's is my main

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,559
what's in it for me the accomplishment

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,440
validation why not positive feedback

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,600
about our ideas is always great

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
uh i think recognition is also very

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,760
important

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,559
uh and it comes in different forms uh if

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,240
you have kids

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,919
you might have used the rewards system

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,679
uh when they grew up if they finished

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
their task or stuff they liked and it's

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
a

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,960
it's an excellent system after all

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,919
gamification processes are all about

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,320
this

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,000
and finally it will help you build your

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,640
skills and put together

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
a better cv in case you're looking for a

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,559
job

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,559
i put this last because if this is your

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,720
only motivator

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:27,039
and your contribution is clearly

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,840
only selfish i am afraid that this will

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,440
not work

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,400
very well because after observing

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,880
hundreds of contributors and now uh

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,559
being also in a position to spot

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,000
uh people uh

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,279
i i can tell you that

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,440
it's clear when there's only the selfish

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,640
part and not the generous part so

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,360
this is why you need both

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,559
so to sum it all up i would like to

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,000
finish with a quote

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,720
from a wordpress core committer a former

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,360
release lead and my partner in life who

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,159
i happen to meet at a contributor day

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,159
so contributing is always a good idea uh

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,279
it could even help with your love life

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,840
who knows

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,960
so john blackburn says make it better

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,799
give it back

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
no matter what pushes you to make it

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,880
better give it back

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,960
so others can enjoy it and probably make

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,760
it even better

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
so that would be all from me i try to

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,919
keep this a bit

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,960
short so hopefully we have time to

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,120
to discuss this together and

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
my name is francesca francesca marano

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,559
i'm the wordpress core team lead

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,840
at yoast and you can find me online

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,840
and let's chat

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,400
thank you so much francesca it was a

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,480
really inspiring talk i

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,159
really liked learning your story about

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
where you started

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,840
starting with recipes and ending up

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,880
becoming a full-time contributor i think

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
that that's

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,919
every story is unique and i think that's

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,720
it's

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,400
great to hear where that came from um

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
and i i really do

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,320
also empathize with your point around

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,440
being selfish in your own

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,919
interests i think we studying open

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,159
source

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
and what really brings people back to

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
continue to contribute

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
because you're interested in it this is

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,559
generally happening with your own free

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,320
time and yes there are

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,159
ways that your company can sponsor you

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,679
to work on projects but fundamental

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,840
you there because you want to be and you

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,279
choose to be and when you're done or

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,799
you're disinterested it's time to

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,039
disengage so i think

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,240
that that's really true to me in terms

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,400
of the projects that i

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
choose to work in to spend my free time

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,960
in i think really what

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,320
makes makes us special because this is

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
all things that we're all individually

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
passionate about so

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
thank you so much um it looks like we

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
have a question

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,120
coming up in the qa francesca can you

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,960
see the qa or do you want me to read it

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,039
no you have to read it because i

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,120
removed everything from my screen that

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,559
okay

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,640
the question is from ali when you want

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,799
nothing more to be generous

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,400
how do you set good boundaries so you

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,400
don't slip into selfishness

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,799
i had to burn out to set boundaries

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
which is something that i don't

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,080
recommend

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,799
so but

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
ultimately that unfortunately that's how

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,799
i learned

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,480
how to set my boundaries um

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,640
in open source because i uh

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
actually at the beginning of my career

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
as a contributor when i was still

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,640
freelancing

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,159
i took on a task that was definitely too

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
big for me

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:44,240
and i didn't ask for help and

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,600
i didn't raise my hands and say i cannot

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,600
do it

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,880
so i think as always in life

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,200
the answer is inside you and you are the

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,200
only one that can really say

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,960
okay what am i doing here and is this

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,440
healthy um having friends

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,159
uh that really care about you as a

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
person

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,480
inside an open source project it's also

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,520
very important because

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,240
sometimes you get so caught up in what

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,679
you're doing that you don't see

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,120
that this is happening so

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,120
they can help uh in

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,120
terms of how being

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,320
generous without being too selfish

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,799
was this the question what mayor how you

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,440
slip

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,919
how you set boundaries yeah okay so how

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,600
do you set

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,919
boundaries is that don't burn out

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,799
uh have friends tell you when you're

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,000
taking too much

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,000
but also suddenly i thought about if we

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,320
have a little bit more time

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,039
is also how not to become just selfish

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,120
which is also something that i see

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,399
happening sometimes

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,679
and um that is also again

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,919
um if you can't recognize that that's

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,760
happening to you and i i actually saw

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
some very good people going down that

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
path

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,840
that you know suddenly it was all about

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
them it was

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,159
either they don't get understood or you

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
know people don't listen and people

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,240
don't do it

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
and you get into this mood then if

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,080
you're not

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,320
to far deep into this

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,440
mode of thinking then definitely

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,919
pull back but hopefully and again i

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,200
think

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,720
a mature and healthy open source

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:47,120
project will call you in

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,360
not call you out they will call you in

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,360
to

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,760
ultimately make it enjoyable for you

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,200
because i think that

00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,799
with all the issues that i found myself

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,799
um either having to mediate

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,200
um a conflict or being myself

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
the conflict it was very important that

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,320
someone pointed

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,360
and said okay let's stop for a second

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,399
this is

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,000
not working and how can we make it

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,200
better together which is

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,399
again the base of open source uh but

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,600
it it takes it's trial and error

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:29,120
it's really really trial and error and

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,159
as peer programming is important for

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,080
developers i think peer contributing is

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,559
also very important so someone will tell

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,159
you hey

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,480
stop stop for a second and

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,320
don't go overboard don't make it all

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,840
about yourself or

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,080
stop working 16 hours a day and

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,679
things like that

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,679
well thank you ali for the question

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,919
thank you for the response francesca's

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,279
or

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,279
any more we we have another

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,760
13 minutes before the close of the

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,960
session so i'm happy to stick around

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,720
um francesca has some of her handle and

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,600
contact information here if you want to

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,159
follow up with her

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,159
offline

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,519
well offline unfortunately i don't think

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,080
we will be able to connect anytime soon

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,840
which is

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,399
um which has been a big change in my

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,600
life so

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,600
before the pandemic i used to travel

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,720
for more than 50 percent of my time

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,279
um the the most

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,159
i traveled was probably in 2018 when i

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,799
was out of

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,799
my home for over 200 days

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,080
and um and now it's all from my

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,440
bedroom in torino italy and it's a bit

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,480
it's i don't know

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
i miss being on the road and at the same

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,320
time

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:03,679
i like being home and doing these things

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,559
on my pjs when they are at

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,559
terrible times

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
i think the latest i did something was

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,240
midnight

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,440
and it was great doing it from bed in my

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,919
pjs with a

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,840
background well i think

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,360
i i hope that people aren't working

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,880
ridiculous hours but i think it is a

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,000
little bit easier too when you

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,399
never leave and i i think even ali's

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,240
earlier comment about

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,000
work things and home things kind of

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,279
intersperse but i also think that

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,640
there's been a bit of

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,320
blending in my home life and my personal

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,600
life especially as it relates to

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,080
timing and schedules yeah i was having

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,399
this conversation today with one

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:56,000
one of the members of my team because

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,600
he works a lot of hours and and i used

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,720
to be that person i used to be a

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,960
workaholic i

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,640
i really used to work 60 hours

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,600
a week minimum when you needed 40 hours

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,840
so you know that was a lot of time more

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,760
than i was supposed to

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,120
um and i was doing this also when i was

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,799
working in the physical office

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,080
going home at 9 00 10 p.m with a taxi

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,240
and stuff like that so when i started

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,159
working on my own

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,279
i uh this got terrible because there was

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,480
no more

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,960
boundaries between my life

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,720
and my work because they all happened in

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,640
the same space

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,000
and then when i joined the side room

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,480
three years ago one of the

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,960
questions was how much do you work

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,760
and i was like what am i supposed to say

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,519
here that i

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,559
work 16 hours a day or did i want

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,000
a good work-life balance so i i just

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,279
said it i said

00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,320
i work more than i want to work

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,240
and the ceo that was interviewing me

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,000
said good because we don't want our

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
people to burn out and work too many

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,399
hours

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,440
that's when i started you know

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,119
also obviously having a paycheck is

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,040
different than being a freelancer

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,079
because when you're freelancer you don't

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,480
know where

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,200
your next meal is coming from basically

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,760
um so today i had this conversation with

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,760
someone in my team who's

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,359
where i was a few years ago and i was

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,240
like you

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,520
i really needed to convince you that

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,919
it's good

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,960
at 6 pm to just turn off your computer

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,879
and do other stuff

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,320
we actually have another question pop-up

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,839
during our discussion

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
kind of related to this this

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,720
conversation about time management

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,839
from an anonymous attendee maybe this is

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,560
a bit off but

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,520
how do you convince your people at home

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,560
that you find

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,480
extra time in open source software and

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,000
and that's fun to you so like how i

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,359
guess not entirely sure what the

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
question is but it sounds like how you

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,400
would

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
um

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,480
how you get people to see that there

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,000
could be joy and interest in

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,320
participating in these things

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,079
in your own time in your own home did i

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,040
did i interpret that correctly please

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,040
correct me if i'm wrong in the in the qa

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,359
um

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,280
so i see both the sides of this because

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:30,480
my partner in life is also

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,760
a wordpress contributor so um we talk

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,960
about wordpress

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,240
way too much than we should

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,400
after our day is over but

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,480
we enjoy this and that's actually how we

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,440
met and that's what we enjoy doing also

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,560
in our

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,720
free time my son is a bit

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
of a different mind because when i when

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,280
i led my

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,440
first release most of the

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,800
of the beta and release candidate and

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,359
stuff like that

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,240
happened at a time that coincides with

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,560
the dinner time or bedtime in italy

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,680
and you know at first it was really like

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,640
oh that's exciting my mom is doing this

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,960
and then towards the end it was like

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,800
when is this going to be over because i

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,599
want to have dinner without

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,599
slack pinging every five seconds

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,800
so he's 14 years old but

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,520
on i told him exactly why i do it

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,359
i showed him the wordpress counter so if

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,640
you go to wordpress.org

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,480
counter i think you see how many people

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,800
how many installs of wordpress are

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,760
active right now

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,440
and i was like i enjoy it because i do

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,720
it with people that i like

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,720
and also because at this moment 35

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,560
million people are using the software

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,400
i'm working on

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,000
but it was good that i brought this up

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,640
because i was like you know what you're

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
right so that's also helped me set

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
boundaries

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,800
so for example now only wednesday nights

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
are

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,320
evenings where i have a chat that it's

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,440
not

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,000
compatible with european time and that's

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,440
when i do

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,320
it so

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,359
show them i i'm a big believer in show

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,160
don't tell

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,880
so show them why you enjoy doing this

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,359
and

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,320
maybe bring them over my son has come

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,599
with me to

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,640
countless events in italy and also

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
abroad

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
he got swag so he was super excited and

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,440
when it

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,000
really got too much for him it was like

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,760
i get your frustration but money right

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,800
now needs to help

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,240
millions of people and then

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,040
we can go and read and do something so

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,839
again it's

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,839
really much about boundaries and it's a

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
negotiation

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,400
i like that i i wish that i could

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,160
negotiate with my cats but they they

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,280
don't really follow the same logic

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,040
they're just i one crying outside my

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,240
door now because he doesn't understand

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,680
that i'm home but i'm not allowing us to

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,359
share the same space

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:15,520
so there are different things our cat

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:19,839
is known to commit things that

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,839
then need to be reverted

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,520
i've personally been enjoying the

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,200
windows into people's personal lives and

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,920
i don't want to say that i'm

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,240
snooping but i think it is about again i

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,839
think

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,240
you said something very poignant which

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,839
is using the community and the

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,400
friendships in the community to help

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,079
you balance your efforts in it and

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,480
reminding that this is

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,680
it is a job after all and even if this

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,839
is personal

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,359
interest and time but it shouldn't can

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,800
be all consuming and you shouldn't let

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,560
yourself get burnt out and you

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,480
you need to have those relationships and

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
people that you trust in

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,680
in these forums and i think especially

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
now that

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,920
we don't have the opportunity to meet an

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,160
engaged person it's harder to build

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,160
those personal relationships and

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,320
relationships and

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
for me i think it's been really

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,160
humanizing when

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,839
someone's pet completely disrupts the

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,760
meeting or their child runs through the

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,400
background and takes their time away but

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,040
it's

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,640
it's little pieces like that that remind

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,680
us that these are not just

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,920
talking productive heads but we all have

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,359
lives and personal lives outside of this

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,040
space and i think it

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,280
it helps to provide just a little bit

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,359
more empathy and connection

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,359
that we're not able to get by not being

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,680
there in person so i think

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,960
i i've been i've been enjoying that

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,839
aspect of it maybe

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,640
just just need the contact in any form

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,480
that it

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,119
so even if it's your cat running across

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,599
the stream i'm i'm very like that

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,240
lifts my mood and then i know a little

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
bit about

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,880
more about you and your life even if you

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
don't want to share more beyond that i

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,160
think that

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:04,640
yeah yeah i agree we miss so much by not

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,200
meeting in person so it's really time

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
for

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,680
everyone to step up and find new ways to

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,280
connect i

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,920
one thing that i i really like um

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,560
and i want to try it in core but i don't

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,040
know yet

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,000
how because it's a it's a really big

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,560
team the

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,520
the wordpress design team does a

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,880
show-and-tell

00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,400
on zoom uh i don't know if every week or

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,160
every two weeks and

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
you know sometimes it's two people

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,200
sometimes it's 20 people

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,200
and it's great because it's it's

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,880
it we have to be honest with ourselves

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,480
this is our reality now for the time

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,599
being so

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,040
we might as well we

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,160
we are over the shock

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,079
we are over the oh this is horrible and

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,359
now we really have to

00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,920
find new ways to to continue this kind

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,839
of

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,359
conversations and connections and

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:08,640
friendships and

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,640
all these kind of things so we'll see

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,599
i couldn't agree more um we have three

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,640
minutes left on the clock well now

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,760
two um we've had a couple of thank yous

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,599
i think i

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,040
highly recommend that you francesca once

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,560
you close out of your talk you read

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,440
through some of the chats just because i

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,640
think they're

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,359
you have some panelists and make sure

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,359
you feel

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
sorry participants you feel connected

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,680
that people were engaged and interested

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,359
i think

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,920
well it sounds like a lot of people have

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,160
heard about that book not a lot but some

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,599
um have heard about that book so i think

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
that there was definitely some

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,319
connection there

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
i think a lot of people and well by a

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,960
lot of people i

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
mean me thought that this was like you

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,839
know

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,040
a 600 pages book like you started this

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,160
book like you start

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,400
the hobbit or something but

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:07,680
it's not if you check it out online

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,680
it's actually a very long html page

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:15,280
and in the print format

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,400
in that i got printed on demand is like

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,680
78 79 pages with

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,640
the epilogue about how netscape

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,680
embraced the bazaar which is incredible

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,119
because i don't know

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:34,640
if you remember netscape i do

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,920
i worked a lot on making websites

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:42,319
uh compatible with netscape in

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,520
98. i ever used
