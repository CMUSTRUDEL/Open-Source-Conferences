Abstract: Why do people contribute to the open source projects? If youâ€™ve ever wondered this but never gotten involved before, you might want to know the value of spending time contributing to one.

All contributors do it for the greater good -- making the web a better place -- but we also do it for ourselves: to advance personally and professionally.

In less than five years Francesca went from being a small-town website maker to landing a dream job in tech and leading two releases of WordPress. In this talk, she will share some of the benefits you can get by contributing to open source, such as improved skills, increased reputation, and meeting new people.
