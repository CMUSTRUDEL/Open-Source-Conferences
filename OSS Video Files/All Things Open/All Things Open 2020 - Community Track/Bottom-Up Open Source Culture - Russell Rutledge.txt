Description: 
	Presented by: Russell Rutledge, InnerSource Commons
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Community Track

Abstract: Open source produces the world's most impactful software. Open source working patterns are the gold standard for how to collaborate on a large software project. These same patterns of open collaboration produce great benefits when applied to company-internal software development. Internal projects, run in an open, collaborative fashion, unlock developer creativity and efficiency. They balance the needs from multiple parts of the company and reduce siloed, duplicative work. They foster a dynamic, fulfilling work environment.

In this presentation, we'll explore how to go about introducing an open source inspired working model within your company from the ground up. We'll look at published patterns of introducing such a culture change and give real-life anecdotes of how those patterns have played out at large software eng. We'll also review the scientific underpinnings of why these patterns work, all in a fun and engaging way with memorable examples. At the end of the presentation you'll leave with a mental guide of principles to follow in bringing open, collaborative behavior to software development inside your company.

thanks everyone for

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,320
being here today uh super excited to

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
talk to you about things that i've found

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
to be true

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,160
in building a culture that supports open

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,600
source and open ways of working

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
from the bottom up so what i've got for

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
you here today

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
is a presentation that's a little more

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,439
in the half hour

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,320
and then we'll leave the rest of the

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,519
time for questions and discussion

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,640
so as we go along just feel free to put

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,760
questions in the q

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
a uh part of the zoom call and then

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
we'll have plenty of time to

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
get to them at the end but don't feel

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
like you have to wait till the end just

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
jot them down as you're going along and

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
if it's not something that's answered or

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,280
as we go along we can

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
talk about it at that point all right

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,280
uh well regina gave a bit of an

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,920
introduction already uh i'm the

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
secretary and a board member at the

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,559
intersource commons foundation

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,440
and the inner source commons is a a

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
foundation

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,000
uh dedicated uh toward uh spreading

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
uh uh treating open source culture and

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
open source ways of working but to

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
company internal software development uh

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,880
this is something that i've had

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
experience at

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,840
at multiple fortune 100 100 companies

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
and it's something i'm really excited

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,000
about i think like over the last

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
20 years we've seen like the rise of

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,320
open source go from something that's a

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,280
hobbyist to something that's

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
developing the most impactful software

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
in the world

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
we realize that open source is kind of

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,320
the gold standard about how to run

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,520
a very very highly impactful widely used

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,439
project

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,439
the things that open source projects

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,759
have had to figure out in order to get

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
effective collaboration also have a ton

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
of lessons for us to learn

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,159
in corporate software development even

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,079
if that software

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
never ends up having uh something that

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,680
goes open open source

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,079
uh a software company of any size

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
is going to start running into all the

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
same problems in its internal

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
development

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,319
that open source projects have already

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,479
solved in their ways of work working

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,319
specifically around like managing and

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,200
balancing the needs for

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,319
many many consumers of software to get

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
to get what they want

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,720
all without not being able to meet up at

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
a given time

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
time and place so just applying those

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
lessons learned from open source

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
to company internal uh software

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,760
development uh that has the name

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
inner source and that's where this uh

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
term

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,319
uh comes from we use in the name of the

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,440
foundation the inner source commons

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
foundation

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,720
so this foundation here's the logo this

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,319
uh taurus here on the screen is the logo

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
the foundation

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,840
the purpose of the foundation is to

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
encourage

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
the teaching the spread the adoption of

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
open source

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
way of working in internal software

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,080
development to encourage the

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
adoption and successful training of

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
inner source in the industry

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,280
so to do this there's a few things the

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
foundation offers

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
uh there's a slack channel that's going

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,239
24 7. i see some people on the

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
intendedly

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080
list they've already found that slack

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,480
channel so it's it's good to see

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
some of you here so that's a place to

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
connect with

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
other inner source practitioners in the

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,120
industry to discuss

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
best practices ways of working or to

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
just say hello

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
the commons intersource commons also has

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,000
a github location

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,560
where we document patterns practices and

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,879
training

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
around inner innersource to share in a

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,440
cross-company manner so

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,840
we're building uh inner source research

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,840
learning and training and we're doing it

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,599
by the same methods that we're

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
encouraging others to use we're doing it

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,760
via these open source methods

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,360
so there's that github location and then

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,480
the the third thing that the

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,200
interface commons offers is multiple

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,159
every year in-person summits those are

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,560
like small

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
conferences dedicated to the subject of

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
intersource

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
and how to bring that open source

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
methodology that open source way of

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
working

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,640
to our company internal development so

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
this is about all i'm going to say about

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,840
the foundation but you can find more

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,319
here at our website at

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,639
intersourcecommons.org

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,440
and for the balance i'd like to talk

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
about some of the

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,239
lessons learned through my own

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
experience and then listening to others

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,919
that are participating

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,199
in these areas that are organized by the

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,919
foundation

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,280
we have over 150 companies that are

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,600
engaging in some way

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
with the the inner source commons and as

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,479
i've listened to their stories

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
there's a there's a lot of commonalities

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,040
i'm going to share some of those

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
conclusions and observations that i had

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
first of all

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,400
there's a pattern to the types of

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,120
projects that make sense within a

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
company

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
to run in this fashion to run as an open

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
source project

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,880
inside you know projects that make sense

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
to run as inner source

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
so so one aspect is when there's a

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
project that has

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
many many internal customers and these

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,560
customers

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,039
have development resources intersource

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
can be

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
a really good fit these are the

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
platforms

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
that software teams around the company

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
generally tend to be platforms that

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
software teams around the company use to

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,560
complete their daily work

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
we're talking about things like

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
continuous deployment

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,080
continuous integration and resources and

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,039
projects to make that happen

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,800
uh with a company with a lot of ui work

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,600
uh in mobile or on the web

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,000
web shared component libraries that

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
allow

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
teams to implement the company style

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
guide throughout all of its assets it's

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,440
another example

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
api standards making sure that api sets

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,840
are consistent

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,400
both internal and external apis

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
tooling for managing interaction with

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
the cloud

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
and how that works uh for teams across

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,639
the company

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
uh and then even for the api sets and

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,000
services

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
that represent the company's uh business

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
data

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,759
uh those apis themselves can be broadly

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,039
used and adopting an inner source

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,759
fashion and manner toward

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,479
toward managing those api services can

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
make sense

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,280
i remember one example at a company that

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,960
did a lot of financial transactions

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,880
and the checkout api service was one

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,199
which teams around the company had a lot

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,720
of high demand for changes

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,800
the team just wasn't staffed to meet

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,639
them all and so they shifted toward

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
running their api service

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
as an intersource project and companies

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,240
that needed changes in functionality

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
could contribute those

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,840
by a pull request and unblock themselves

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,520
without waiting for the team to

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
prioritize their particular scenario on

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,240
the roadmap

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,800
so that's an example of what i mean of

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,680
running a business api service

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
as as an inner source project and the

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
the commonality here

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,599
is that when you get enough internal

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,880
customers that are spread far enough

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
throughout the company

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
traditional ways of organizing work

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
break down

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,440
many of us may have participated in some

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,280
form

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,599
of of agile scrum with sprint planning

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,120
maybe a scaled agile framework that

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
groups different teams together and

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
scrum

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
scrums all these are designed to

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
facilitate

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
cross-team dependencies and

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,960
communication some of these platform

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,960
services they have so many internal

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,720
customers and consumers that there's

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,080
never going to be some kind of

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,440
top-down orchestrated synchronous scaled

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
process that's going to be able to

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
manage and plan for all those

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
dependencies

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
what do you do in that case how do you

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
figure it out well open source has

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
already figured that out

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,080
there are these software projects we saw

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,599
the logos earlier in the presentation

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,280
uh they're used around the world by

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,319
people in different time zones with very

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
different needs

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
and the open source way of working

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,000
anyone can open an issue

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
anyone can open up pull requests people

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
are up level you know through

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
to be committers and maintainers this

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
process works inside the company too and

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
this is inner source this is how

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,639
we take the next step uh that agile or

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,319
scaled agile quant quite bring

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,639
and scale these projects to meet the

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
needs of all the internal customers

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
and this helps us to solve a problem

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,520
that some of you may experience

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
may have experienced in your uh in your

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
company or in your business

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
where there's duplication of projects uh

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
multiple projects the company that are

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
solving a

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,599
a similar need this is also a very

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
common story

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
intersource can help with this no one

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
wants to make a duplicative projects

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
just because they think it's fun or they

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
think that theirs

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,120
is better it's just that the first

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,039
project that then gets duplicated

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,959
it's having trouble scaling to the set

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
of consumers that want to use it through

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,599
these

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,039
these problems i talked about earlier

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,680
applying inner source applying these

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,159
open source

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,320
methodologies allows projects to scale

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,920
more broadly throughout the company

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
so there's not a need for duplicative

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
projects everyone can just use

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,760
use the one and this is how this is how

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
i got started in this area at inner

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
source

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,120
i was working on one of these platform

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,519
projects it was a continuous delivery

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
project for websites at the company i

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
was working on at the time

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
now we needed to solve this problem of

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,720
how we scale

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
very very early because we didn't have a

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,600
lot of funding to do what we needed to

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
do

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,399
a lot of the emphasis was on back-end

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,880
api services and a continuous delivery

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,920
of websites was kind of an afterthought

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
and so we formed a development community

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,040
where

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,200
multiple squads or teams could

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
contribute to a shared repository for

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,399
their deployment needs

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
this was beginning of our intersource

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
project and over

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,160
the next two and a half years with very

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,720
very little funding and a very small

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,720
team

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,880
this became one of the most widely used

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,040
projects at the company

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,279
at one point we were able to get metrics

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,200
and measurement around how it was used

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,920
and we had verifiably 90 percent

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,720
of all commits going to websites at the

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,160
company

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,519
were going to a repository that used

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,519
our project for their uh for their test

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,480
and production deployments

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
so 90 percent so virtual monopoly on

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,760
market share

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
we didn't have any leader telling

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,800
everyone that they had to

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,760
work with us we didn't have a large

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,399
staff or funding or some

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
some involved scaled planning process we

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
were able to adopt

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
open source principles to this internal

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,399
project we're able to adopt

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,959
inner source uh to achieve this effect

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,720
and that kind of got me to my uh job

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
where i'm not now things have evolved

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
but

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,440
now my full-time job is bringing about

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
uh intersource

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
intersource behavior and i i found and

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
this holds true to other companies

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,880
that have participated in the inner

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
source commons also i found that this is

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
uh really a culture change so all the

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,640
balance of the talk we're going to talk

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
about culture

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,160
and what it means to change culture and

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,360
i love this quote from

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,640
management guru culture eats strategy

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
for breakfast inner source and a move

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,040
toward inner source

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,160
is really a change in strategy

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,839
but that strategy has to sit in a

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,079
culture that's going to support it

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,160
otherwise that strategy is going to get

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,720
eaten up for breakfast

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,240
so there are some points of culture that

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
need to be there in order for inner

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,760
source to work out

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,000
is we need a culture at the company

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,120
where this approach is being tried

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,760
we need a culture that supports

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,800
both in word and then also in action

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,560
that supports

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,600
things like contribution gratitude

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,920
transparency meritocracy

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
asynchronicity and for those who have

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,720
worked in successful open source

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
projects these things

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
probably aren't a surprise they're the

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,399
same thing that a successful

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,640
open source community needs to thrive

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
those need also need to be present

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
for an inner source project to thrive

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,880
and the problem is

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,120
that a lot of ways that

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
are structured at companies to get work

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
done

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,040
by default don't necessarily embody

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,000
all of these traits whether

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,480
intentionally or not just in practice

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,920
many companies have cultures that reward

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,279
things like

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,120
achievement self-promotion

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
things are opaque you know there's

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
opacity is kind of the default rather

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,440
than transparency

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,079
influence tends to come by formal

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,880
position

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,160
or organization organizational hierarchy

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
and things get done

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
by uh meetings and all these you go

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
point for point

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,079
uh all those that i called out fly in

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,399
the face of the type of culture

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
uh that's gonna bring about a successful

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,480
inner source

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,920
uh so that's hard yeah so if if you are

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
considering adopting an

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,560
inner source strategy you need to think

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,760
seriously about the culture and at the

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,160
same time as

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,120
promoting an inner source strategy also

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
be working

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,800
to promote and foster the type of

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,320
culture that's going to make it

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
successful

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
and what we're going to talk about here

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,200
in the balance of the talk

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,639
is some examples and some metaphors

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
to align on how to think about going and

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
doing that

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
it's going to be a little different in

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
every company it's going to be different

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
at the same company in different parts

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,959
of the company

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,240
but these principles that i'll teach

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,320
will hold true and

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
they've held true for me for years as

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
i've talked about them with others over

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
the

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
years they resonate they hold true as

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
well so i want to go over those and

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,839
commend them

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,800
to you so i'm going to start with a

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,480
picture here

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,880
of how i think about culture change

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
culture changes is is hard and in this

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,920
picture we have a picture

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,120
of this cement slab cement slab and

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
sidewalk

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,720
and in this i want to compare the

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,920
slab to your company's current culture

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
it's flat it's smooth it's big uh it's

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,519
hard

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
and it's really really solid um and in

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,120
order to

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,000
put a a crack in that uh to execute some

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
change in that

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,079
that's gonna really take some doing yet

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
here in the picture

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,240
uh look at it there's a crack that's

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,000
gone through this seemingly

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,040
a hard solid totally unbreakable thing

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,240
it's got a crack

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,079
in it how how did it crack

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
you know what finally was able to get

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
that thing to crack uh here representing

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,320
the

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,199
the culture uh was it a jackhammer

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,279
was it a a sledgehammer and chisel did

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,079
someone go and hit it from the top

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,720
until it finally gave under the pressure

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,600
no

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,959
that wasn't it you can see behind it's

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,279
it's the tree

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,320
it's the tree and the root going from

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,760
the tree

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,199
has grown slowly imperceptibly

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,440
uh day by day and become so powerful

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,399
you know that root has been embedded so

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
firmly

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,839
uh that that slab had no choice uh but

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,800
to break

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,320
under its growth and i can't emphasize

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,399
enough the importance and we'll

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,560
we'll talk about this as the top goes on

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,440
uh the importance of setting down

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
roots of something new that sink into

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,959
the ground

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,240
and grow so powerful that they break the

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
breakthrough

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
the culture that's that's currently

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,240
there this is the way to think

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
about culture change setting down roots

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,920
helping them grow

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,600
as opposed to a top-down mighty crack

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,079
now this idea and approach to

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
culture change in a corporate situation

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,839
is not unique to bringing in inner

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,560
source it's not even unique to the tech

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,160
industry there are established patterns

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
of how to go about doing this

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
in a corporate environment that have

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,839
been wonderfully

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,279
documented here in this book more

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
fearless change

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:47,600
by mary lynn manns and linda rising

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,399
i can't recommend this book highly

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,040
enough to you

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,000
if any kind of culture change initiative

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,440
is part

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
part of your job inner source or

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,800
otherwise the things here

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,519
work for all this book is especially

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
useful because it's organized into a set

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,279
of

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,800
self-contained reasonable patterns

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,399
around how to effect change uh in a in a

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,320
corporate environment

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,560
each of these patterns at the beginning

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,560
they'll list the prerequisites

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
that if they're necessary this pattern

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,759
could be useful to you

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
and they're short there's three to five

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,240
pages so you could just pick out

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
one particular pattern that addresses a

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
problem that you're solving you don't

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
have to go and read the whole book it

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
can serve as a wonderful

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,320
off-the-shelf five to ten minute

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
resource for you

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
the patterns the prerequisites are

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
clearly documented

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
the patterns are summarized very

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,920
succinctly and all of them

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,000
are accompanied by real world examples

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
that show how the pattern is played out

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,600
in an actual situation

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
in a way that makes sense and helps you

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
imagine how this pattern could help you

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,079
with whatever you're facing

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
so i can't recommend it more highly uh a

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,519
lot of what we've done has been in here

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,800
sometimes um sometimes intentionally and

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
sometimes we've been

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,400
uh going with a particular strategy

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,520
around introducing inner source

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,199
and we've subsequently gone back and

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,600
read this book and we've seen oh you

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,360
know that

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,439
that pattern describes what we're doing

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,039
you know yep that works pretty good

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
and then other times it's been more

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,160
proactive we had a particular problem

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
been able to crack open this

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,799
this book uh find something and try it

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,799
out and then sure enough it works

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,319
so i won't go into everything in here i

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,919
have to leave the book for you to read

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
but i do want to list off some of the

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
patterns that are in here that we found

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,360
to be very useful and they have catchy

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,520
short names that kind of give you an

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,840
idea of the types of things they do

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,679
so let's list off really quick we've

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,360
used these patterns of

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,679
testing the waters when trying something

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,200
new finding and cultivating early

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,960
adopters

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
breaking through stagnation and just

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,799
doing it giving sincere gratitude to

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,640
those who participate

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
and when we talk with folks making sure

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,720
we leave a really personal touch

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,919
with those we're trying to influence

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,760
we've sought out

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,160
and continued to draw in corporate

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
angels to back up what we're doing

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,320
uh uh made sure that becoming a

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
dedicated uh champion is

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,520
uh part of the part of our job at the

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
company

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,559
uh found ways to involve everyone who's

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
supported

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,679
uh while at the same time giving each

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,039
person just enough of what they need

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,160
to clear the way before us we've uh we

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,280
spent time in

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,440
uh corridor politics and there's also uh

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,320
many many more this is a few that have

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,760
found useful to us and i want to

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,559
summarize

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,960
uh a on the next page a picture that i

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,280
think

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
draws in a lot of key aspects we've

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,080
talked about already

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
in setting down firm roots and uh and

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,559
aspects that are supported by all these

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
patterns

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
and again i want to do with a picture

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,160
here a picture of a tree

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
and we're in a form a metaphor for

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,919
introducing

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,919
inner source or a new culture change uh

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
through exploring the parts of this uh

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,559
this picture

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,320
a newly planted tree so first of all the

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,320
the visible part of the tree the

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,160
trunk the branches this represents

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,240
inner source behavior inner source

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
activity right now it's just a small

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,039
tree it's just

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,120
something that we hope grows hopefully

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,600
one day it'll have huge

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,400
metaphorically huge towering branches

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,520
with

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,919
lush green leaves and tasty fruit

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,400
that all could enjoy but in this picture

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,120
we're just getting something planted

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
now i think just from the metaphor of a

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,880
tree

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,080
it becomes very clear that the soil the

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,240
trees planting in is

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
is very important and in this metaphor

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,120
i'm going to say that represents

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,520
what we've been talking about the

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
current culture uh in your

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,559
your company where you want to see inner

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,559
source behavior

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
and it's very clear that for the tree to

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,080
live on and grow

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,760
that culture has got to be conducive to

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,120
that behavior and activity so it's just

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,720
a visual point

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,200
on what i was trying to what i was

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,120
trying to say say earlier

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
now uh sometimes it's hard to know i

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,520
don't know like is the culture conducive

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,200
enough

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,720
uh the way you're gonna know the thing

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,080
that you can observe is you start to

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,039
teach people about inner

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
source do you see people voluntarily

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,240
adopting

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
or voluntary participating in the new

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,039
behavior

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,600
that activity is example

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
of the culture being conducive so that

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,960
roots

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,200
are naturally being put down okay so

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,520
voluntary participation and resource

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
that's the root uh here in the metaphor

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
and it happens when the culture is

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,640
conducive to the new activity

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
uh now i re uh what happens a lot of

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,360
times

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,280
is you know maybe culture isn't so

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,720
conducive and after teaching others

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
people are having a tough time getting

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
started

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,799
uh maybe you've seen this in some other

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,840
culture change initiative it's just not

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,919
quite going well

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,320
even though even though the desired

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,559
behavior has been communicated

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,799
so when that happens people try a

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,960
strategy that i think is analogous to

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,559
actually planning a live new tree and

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,120
you've probably seen this before

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,240
if there's a young sapling that's just

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,320
getting started

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,480
that is just getting going and can't

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
really stand up to the elements on its

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,039
own it's a little unsteady

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,960
what we might do to strengthen it is to

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,360
put something that is strong

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
that can stand on its own next to it in

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,440
the ground

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,320
and then we tie we tie that tree

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
to that solid thing so it can reinforce

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,000
it as it's growing and

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,720
the most we got this example here in the

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
picture

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,799
you see the kind of wooden or metal rods

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
and i think all of us have seen this

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,120
around trees

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
you know maybe growing in a city

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,080
somewhere that are young

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,240
in this example the most common thing

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,720
that i see people tie

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
this new behavior inner source to is

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
leadership advocacy

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,240
the leadership structure is already

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
strong already solid it already stands

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,520
on its own

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
uh let's let's tie inner source to that

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,440
and we get people

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
get the support of leaders have leaders

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
people's

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
leaders senior director vice president

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,679
cto whatever

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,760
uh tell them how important inner source

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,760
is and they have to participate

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,120
right so metaphorically it's like tying

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
it to that solid

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,720
post and that may help things to to

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,600
stand for a time without falling over

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,480
but in this picture i think it shows is

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
very key

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,640
that that needs to be a temporary

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,039
measure tying it to something else

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
just gives it time for the roots to go

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,520
down and get solid

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,559
the tree uh the tree isn't meant to

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
stand forever

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,760
tied to this rod in fact the idea is

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,880
that

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,480
uh the the rod is one day taken away

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
the roots have been set down the trunk

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,240
has been made solid it stand on its own

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,240
and it grows higher and higher

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,600
higher than it ever could if it needed

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
to be propped up by

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
something so small and simple as a rod

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,039
that's

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,960
the goal and you know with the physical

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,120
tree i think it's very obvious

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
metaphorically when introducing a

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,559
culture change

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
it can be very tempting once that change

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,280
has been tied

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,840
to leadership advocacy to stop and say

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,919
hey this is standing on its own that's

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,559
it we've done it we're successful

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,720
and neglect checking on the roots to see

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,840
if people are voluntarily participating

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,840
on the new behavior

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
or if it's only standing because of

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,120
being tied

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,760
to that metaphorical post you know being

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,039
tied to leadership advocacy

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,120
this is so important because

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,159
uh one day or another that leadership

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,679
advocacy

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,760
is guaranteed to go away it's happened

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,440
every single time that i've heard of

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,760
this shared in the inner source commons

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,919
and logically it just makes sense

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,880
leadership advocacy and leadership time

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
and attention

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
is a scarce resource and these people

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,880
have a lot coming at them a lot of

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,919
important things that affect all

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,159
all sorts of aspects of the company it's

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,720
just a matter of time before there's

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,799
some kind of change in focus where that

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
scarce resource of advocacy

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,000
isn't able to get put toward your

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,000
activity of inner source

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,679
anymore or even before that happens

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,520
as frequent or maybe more frequent

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,919
there's going to be a change in leader

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
there's going to be some reorg or a new

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,600
vice president

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,200
is going to be hired something is going

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,640
to happen where there's a new leader

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
that comes in

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,480
so one day or another that supporting

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,200
post is going to be taken away

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,400
and if if your new inner source activity

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,640
hasn't taken root

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
it'll it'll fall over uh fall over at

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
that point

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,320
this is so important over the last three

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,760
years where i've been working in this

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,000
area

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,039
my own leadership change there's been uh

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,799
i've my

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,159
direct manager's been swapped out seven

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,080
different times

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,159
but because what we're doing had

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
voluntary participation and was taking

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
root

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,679
uh our work toward inner source has

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,200
continued basically uninterrupted

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,600
again it's because of focusing on the

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,960
roots uh because of focusing

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,919
on making sure that people are

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,600
voluntarily participating

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,440
so let's talk a little bit about

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,400
voluntary participation again with

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,480
another picture

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
and how to think about you know like

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,440
okay that sounds great

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
uh russ but but how do we how do we go

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
about doing that let me give a picture

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,039
that give principles

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
around voluntary participation now that

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,840
we've talked about about why it's

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
important

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,440
okay so uh here's the next uh picture

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,960
uh that i used to think about this here

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,679
i've mapped out a

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
coordinate space uh and i think there's

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,159
some

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,240
lessons learned here that can give us a

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,760
frame of mind of how to think about it

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,960
so in this coordinate space uh uh

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,799
this uh represents um a team's uh

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240
way of working way of developing

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,240
software you know like maybe they use a

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,880
scrum or agile process

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,240
and the i've represented a team or a

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
person

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,520
by this stick figure that's here here

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,039
that you see on the slide

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,960
now let me point out the other aspects

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:52,240
of what i've drawn on here

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,520
first of all we have the vertical axis

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,279
so this this axis represents the effort

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,240
that it takes for this person or

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,279
team to develop software in this manner

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,480
uh so there's

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,919
uh some some effort involved for example

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
i keep using the example of scrum or

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,400
agile there's different ceremonies

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,640
excuse me there's different ceremonies

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
that are involved and uh sometimes i

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,600
don't know if you do i hear

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
developers and engineers kind of gripe

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,799
about that sometime like so many

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,640
meetings in scrum why can't

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,080
why can't we just code uh so they're

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
recognizing the fact that there is some

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
effort

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,400
involved there but there's also some

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,039
benefit uh as well to that

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,559
and i hear that's represented along the

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,039
horizontal axis

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,039
uh the benefit that this person or team

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,360
gets by putting forth this effort

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,880
and i think again back to this kind of

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
canonical example i've been using of

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
scrum and agile i think people believe

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
that

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,360
uh although there's some effort to be

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,279
put in uh there's there's clearly

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,080
uh clearly the benefit as well so it's

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,919
worth doing and i kind of marked that

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,440
hypothetically theoretically with the

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,440
word uh current

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,039
uh on the on the graph let's suppose

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,440
that represents you know this stick

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
figure engaging in a standard scrum or

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,559
agile process

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
and you can see it has some vertical and

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,559
then it has some horizontal

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,320
um dimension to it so it takes some

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,200
effort but brings some benefit

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,960
now uh an in inner source or kind of

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,919
bringing in open source methodology to

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
your project

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,720
uh is a is a new way of working

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,720
a new way of working all of a sudden i'm

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,480
gonna be potentially submitting pull

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,399
requests to a repository that i don't

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
own but because i need a feature there

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,679
there may be other people at the company

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,039
that are submitting pull requests to my

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
repository and i've never met them

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
before

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
so that's something new and that's going

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,679
to take more effort

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,120
if you've been involved in successful

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,600
open source projects

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,039
you may felt as i did that you kind of

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,799
get familiar with the effort after a

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,760
while and something totally manageable

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,600
and reasonable

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,440
so maybe it takes a little bit more

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,200
effort and i've represented that here on

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,200
the slide by the word new you can see

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,399
it's like it's a little higher up

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,559
a little higher up than the current

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,640
position so a little bit more effort

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,240
but the benefits and i talked about some

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,880
of these earlier kind of widespread

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,039
adoption

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,360
like deduplication people can unblock

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,039
themselves and those benefits are huge

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,559
these are really common complaints of

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,679
developing software in a large

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,120
enterprise

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,360
so having a way to in a scaled way to

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,240
to take away those complaints huge

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,640
benefit

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
so again to represent that that word new

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,720
is is pretty far to the

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
right on the on the slide so a little

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
bit more effort but

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,679
a lot more benefit and this seems like a

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,120
no-brainer let's let's do it

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,159
time to time to inner source everyone um

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,520
and uh the problem is that

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,000
uh in practice uh for a person or for a

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,559
team

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
to migrate from their current position

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,720
to the new position

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,520
it's not necessarily a straight shot

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,159
like i just

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,120
hop over there in fact a lot of times

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,760
the migration

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,039
path follows a curve like the squiggly

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,600
line that i've drawn

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,360
uh in fact i'm i'm being kind of nice by

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
saying it's a curve like it's like

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,720
it's like a mountain it's taller than

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,159
that person is in fact if you

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
imagine our stick figure kind of like

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,760
walking along that curve

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
very quickly in looking at the axes very

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,000
quickly

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,840
they're going to be expending more

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
effort for very

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,679
little increased benefit you know can

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,039
you can you see it on the curve kind of

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,520
the steepness of the curve

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,520
a lot of initial effort uh without

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,080
really getting a lot of the benefits

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,080
in fact if we all were to put on our

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,000
kind of imagination hats and imagine

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,159
ourselves like going into the slide

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
here imagine yourself with your head and

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,120
eyes at the position of the head of that

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,440
stick figure

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,559
you can see that the mountain of effort

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,919
in front of you

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,080
is so tall that you don't even have

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,960
metaphorically you do not even have line

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,880
of sight

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
where you can see the new position where

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,159
you're gonna gonna arrive at

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,440
let me let me circle that yeah that's

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,159
the mountain we're talking about i don't

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,240
even have

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,840
line of sight to see the new position

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,600
how great it's gonna be

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,600
uh so while all of us here listening to

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,320
the presentation are are so excited to

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
spread

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,559
inner source wave way of working uh and

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
from our vantage point we can see how

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,480
great it's going to be for this stick

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,919
figure

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,760
uh for them it just looks like a lot of

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,480
work without a lot of benefit

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,919
and in this situation uh this might be

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,480
the type of situation

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,320
where there's some pushback and people

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,880
don't want to make the change and

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,559
again if if you've been in a a corporate

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,120
situation where there's some change

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,960
initiative that's been announced

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
maybe you've seen this effect before

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
there are some people who are very

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,559
excited for everyone to make the change

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,200
but those who actually need to put in

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,080
effort

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,159
are not as excited about it and i don't

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,039
i don't think that anyone is being

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,080
difficult

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,720
or short-sighted i don't think that

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,720
anyone kind of isn't for some reason you

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,679
know can't see or can't understand

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
it's just we have a different

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
perspective right you can kind of

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,440
empathize with this this person

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,039
so what what happens a lot of times in

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,320
this situation i see people do it for

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,559
inner source too is when there's

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,320
resistance to making a change

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,679
uh from our vantage point again we can

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,480
see how great it's gonna be

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,120
so there's this thought that says well i

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
know

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,960
i know how great this is and how much

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,919
everyone needs it uh let's

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,840
let's put in energy and kind of uh

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,600
encourage and force the people to make

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,360
this change let's force them up and over

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,200
that level of effort because in the end

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,840
it's it's for their own good

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,080
and that's something that you can you

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
can do this can come in the form of

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,159
extrinsic rewards for those who complete

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,039
the change uh it can be

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,840
uh management or social pressure on

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,080
people

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,200
uh to encourage them to to make the

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,360
change

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,240
uh but the problem with that is is it

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,640
takes

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,440
energy and it's energy that goes into

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
something

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,200
uh that that doesn't doesn't live on its

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,320
energy that's expended once

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,679
and and and that's tough because uh if

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,240
the change is

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,120
successful on a small scale uh what gets

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,000
asked

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,519
uh well that was great you helped one uh

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,039
can you go ahead and help everyone and

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,840
soon that becomes like everyone at the

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,159
company

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,200
uh to help them make this change and the

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,519
problem is

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,120
is that if your strategy to help people

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,519
to make the change is to apply

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,559
energy at them you have to scale up the

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
amount of energy

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,080
in order to get them all up and over

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,080
that hill

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,159
and when you want to go really broad all

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,080
of a sudden the resources it takes

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,080
to come up with that much energy you

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
know that much social managerial

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,519
pressure

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,799
that many extrinsic rewards all of a

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,919
sudden you're back to

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,919
needing that leadership advocacy as a

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,919
key component of this change to be

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,519
successful as we talked about earlier

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
the minute that leadership advocacy

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,200
goes away maybe not the minute but

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,320
eventually that leadership advocacy will

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,640
go away

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,360
and if that's the linchpin of the whole

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
strategy

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,240
things will slide right back down the

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,960
slope uh slope to where they were

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,039
so uh what this principle of voluntary

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,279
participation tells us

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,159
is instead of expending energy at the

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,720
people

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,440
where it's used once and then gone and

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
by the way

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
uh which isn't very much fun for the

00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,919
people usually maybe you've been one of

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,320
these people where you've

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
like felt some energy directed at you to

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
make a change that's hard and that

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,080
doesn't really make sense to you uh

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,559
that's not really fun for the people

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,559
at all either uh so what this principle

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,240
of voluntary participation teaches is

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,880
instead of expending that energy at the

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
people

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
let's look at the landscape and

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,559
especially this hill like like why is it

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,880
there

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,559
why is it hard for people to make this

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,320
change why is there so much effort that

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,799
they can't see the benefits of something

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,799
new

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,640
and is that feedback for us on the

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,799
location of the new position

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,159
or how we're communicating uh the change

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,120
or how difficult it is to make the

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,200
transition

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,159
and can we take that energy and then

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,159
apply it to

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,919
thinking about that hill instead and

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,720
then hopefully like like knock it down

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,960
to where

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,720
it's not as difficult to make the uh to

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,640
make that change and here

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,159
again metaphorically if we put ourselves

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,840
in the page of this picture

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,919
you can see that although there's some

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,320
work involved it's not as much as before

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,279
and especially a key is metaphorically

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,919
these people

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,679
have line of sight to the new position

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,679
and the increased benefits they'll bring

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,519
and it as their friends migrate

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,200
people that are at the new position are

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,240
metaphorically visible to those of the

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,320
current position

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
like further reinforcing the fact that

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,159
they should make the change

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,320
and we're going to talk about that

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,839
reinforcement and the role it plays in

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,240
in just a second

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,119
but just going back to my example i

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,760
talked about earlier

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,440
the continuous delivery project again

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,639
that eventually kind of got a monopoly

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,800
at the company

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,960
we always took this approach and any

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
time we explained

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,960
that people should use our project for

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,040
deployments and they didn't want to

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
we always took that as feedback that in

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,679
some way

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,159
maybe we even we couldn't see it there

00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,919
was some kind of mountain of difficulty

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
between where they were at and where we

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,440
wanted them to be which

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,320
which in our case was using our project

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,119
and our

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,000
goal was to find out what that was and

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,599
get rid of it

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,280
maybe we need to articulate better the

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,320
benefits of working with us maybe we

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,320
need better tooling

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,520
maybe our continuous delivery project

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,839
doesn't meet all their needs and it

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,560
needs more features and functionality

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,160
and by adopting this approach we always

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,000
learn something whether or not

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,680
the person or team eventually came

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,160
around and

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,839
eventually came around and used our and

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,880
used our project

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,960
i remember when i started i communicated

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
this continuous delivery project and i

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,160
was telling a friend

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,920
okay we're gonna have a repository

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,520
everyone around is gonna commit to it

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,079
and give pull requests when they need

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,920
help

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,280
and i remember my my friend almost

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,920
laughing and saying

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,359
uh russ you know no one's gonna do that

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,560
you have to get their director to tell

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,040
them they have to work with you or

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,560
they're just going to go their own way

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,160
you know it's like applying that social

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,000
pressure and i remember

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,440
thinking and i still do think i thought

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,359
you know no way

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,280
i'm not going to do that if they don't

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,960
voluntarily want to use my project

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,680
because it makes their life better

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,560
that's feedback to me that i need to i

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,400
need to improve

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,760
and and that's been a very productive

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,200
way of thinking about it which i think

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,480
goes along with this

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,079
uh with this picture and and this

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
here we have you know we've gone over

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,000
some uh metaphors

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,960
and pictures uh anecdotally they've held

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,599
truth for me

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,800
and also anecdotally for experiences

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
that i've heard in the inner source

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,839
commons

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,359
uh all of them uh that i've heard at the

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,160
summits you know they can all be thought

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,040
of in this

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,560
this model uh and also there's uh some

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,200
academic research that

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,760
backs up this way of thinking uh this

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,040
author

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
dr damon cintola in this book how

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,480
behavior script spreads

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,880
a great book i'm gonna give you the the

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,839
premise uh because it is a real read

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,440
uh but this this subtitle uh kind of

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,000
sets the stage for how

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,920
uh dr centola thinks about the spread of

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,240
behavior in a society

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,440
and this is society in general but but

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,520
you know a corporate

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,599
uh culture at a company that's an

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,839
example of a type of society

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,960
uh so this subtitle can introduces how

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,000
he's thinking about it

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,320
the science of complex contagions and

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,680
it's

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
super interesting it's kind of timely

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,000
right now because we're like in the

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,720
midst of this

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
uh global pandemic where this you know

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,520
contagion is

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,359
has spread throughout the world and

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,880
that's actually kind of the start of

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,160
uh you know you wrote this several years

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,359
ago so it wasn't referring to the

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,000
coronavirus

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,359
uh but uh the the spread of a

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
communicable disease

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,680
is how he starts explaining explaining

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,560
things and he contrasts the spread of

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,040
behavior

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
to his which he calls a simple contagion

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,880
uh to the spread of a

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,480
uh of excuse me the spread of a

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,599
communicable disease which he calls a

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,119
simple contagion

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,119
he contrasts that to the spread of

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,160
behavior which he calls a complex

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,720
contagion

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,200
uh so let's look at what this looks like

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,320
uh the idea behind a spread of a simple

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,920
contagion

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
uh again this could be a a common cold

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
or

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,599
in our world it could be the the

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,040
coronavirus at least best as i

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,839
understand this how the coronavirus

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,800
spreads

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,520
a simple contagion needs just uh one

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,200
person

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,839
that's infected uh infected or that has

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,520
uh has the contagion uh just one person

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,800
to come in contact with others and

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,680
everyone with whom they come into

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,640
contact uh potentially is then infected

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,960
or then has

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,480
has that attribute so when you think

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,920
about that in a corporate environment

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
say we have one person in the middle or

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,000
at the top

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,599
the cto or ceo this person may have some

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,160
direct reports and because of this

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,839
reporting

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,000
relationship we can say that they're

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,079
connected in this

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
in this corporate culture now each of

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,359
these uh direct reports maybe they're

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,160
managers and they all have their own

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,839
teams

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
and uh we'll say that everyone on the

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,440
team is connected to each other

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,520
uh and connected to the manager because

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,839
they all work together as a team

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,520
uh work together as a squad all right

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,200
now uh if the

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,079
the person at the top or in the middle

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,720
has a new idea they want to spread

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,000
uh if this idea spreads via the simple

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,839
contagion model

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,280
it travels along this person's

00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,760
connection so

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,599
the again back to the corporate example

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,480
the cto has a new idea

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,440
that gets spread to all this person's uh

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
managers

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,280
and the managers because they have the

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,599
idea uh spread it to all of their

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,839
teams and everyone on the team so

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,200
everyone gets the new idea

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,280
dr cintola has modeled that information

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,480
tends to spread this way between people

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,599
you know as well as communicable

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,440
diseases

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,960
and again if you worked in a corporate

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,320
environment like i have you've probably

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,640
seen this there's some

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,480
uh big announcements or uh you know a

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,280
new a new cto

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,520
uh you know new leader comes in and uh

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,200
where people have social connections

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,400
it could be among team binder dynamics

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,800
it could be other connections people

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,960
have

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,640
that information spreads spreads pretty

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,040
quickly

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,040
now some people would like behavior

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,800
changes to spread this way

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,880
that from the top or from the middle we

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,599
could say okay we're going to adopt an

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,920
inner source

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,200
culture and practice and behavior and it

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,800
would spread the same way and then

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,960
everyone would be working in our source

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,520
that that's not the case dr cintola has

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,560
has shown academically you know with

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,640
academic rigor

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
that behavior spreads as a complex

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,960
contagion

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,480
and what what a complex contagion

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,359
means is that one person that's

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,520
infected or or hosts that new attribute

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,240
that new behavior

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,160
excuse me one person is not enough to

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,480
spread it to their connections

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,200
multiple points of reinforcement are

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,520
needed

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
before a new person will adopt the new

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,720
behavior

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
and kind of socially acceptable behavior

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,079
is something that dr cintola

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,920
has shown spreads this way and in his

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,880
book he like calculates activation

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,640
thresholds like

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
how many people around me do i need to

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,920
be activated in order to adopt the new

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
behavior myself

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,880
is it percentage based is absolute

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,800
numbers based and it goes through you

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,520
know case studies and

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
and so forth but that's the premise you

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,359
know one point

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
of uh one point of reinforcement isn't

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,520
enough

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,920
multiple points of reinforcement are

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,839
needed uh and again in my

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,599
situation i've seen this i think some of

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,839
you have probably seen this too

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,359
maybe there's some big new initiative

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,599
there's some big new announcement

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,520
you know okay everyone we're all gonna

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,800
uh head this way we're gonna

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,240
use this new tool adopt this new process

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
and if you're like me you've seen

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
everyone kind of wait a little bit

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,400
like uh okay i heard what you said

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,839
let me look around and see if my are you

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,680
are my peers doing it

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,520
do i hear the message again you know are

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,119
we actually going to do it

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,720
again they don't know it but they're

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,400
they're demonstrating this behavior that

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,880
dr cintola has shown

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,240
they're looking where's my second or

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
sometimes it's third or more

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,720
you know where are my other points of

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
reinforcement because a change of

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,920
behavior is a complex contagion

00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,839
so that that is is keys

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
so we'll talk about how that plays out a

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,880
little bit and

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,560
as i said this simple model kind of

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,880
organizational hierarchy

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,800
does not represent all of the paths that

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,960
exist in a corporation

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,960
for connections to be made either people

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,599
that know folks on other teams

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,760
whether in a casual or professional way

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,160
so the the crux of having a new behavior

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,040
that's

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,880
at the center that is desired to spread

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,400
is not to push harder at the center

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,640
uh we need to set up points of

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,680
reinforcement so that new people can

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,400
become activated

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,079
with with new behavior with inner source

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
uh so if we strategically

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,200
kind of see the graph with a few people

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,680
that can become

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,480
bought in that are already connected to

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,880
each other

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079
those people can reinforce the behavior

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,119
in one another

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,359
and being converted to the new behavior

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,240
against the idea of inner source here

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,839
they can then

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,920
spread that influence among their

00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,800
connection with that spread

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,920
there are now new kind of nodes in our

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
social network

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,119
new people that have enough

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,880
reinforcement to also become

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,480
activated to adopt and to try the

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,160
new behavior and assuming it goes well

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,680
and people actually see the benefits of

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,920
an inner source way of working

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,359
and continue to want to work that way

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,960
they can then spread to their

00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,359
networks more people can become

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,800
activated and so on

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,480
this is again an academically backed

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,480
model of behavior change

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,560
of the principles that i was i've been

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,760
talking about earlier

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,160
all the principles i talked about

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,079
earlier they support this

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,200
mode of of activation when you set

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,079
down roots and make sure those roots are

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,119
growing

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:26,240
those roots form a web that spans

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,119
throughout and traverses the social or

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,520
hierarchical

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,480
networks that exist in your corporation

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,400
at that company

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,240
focusing on the roots and making sure

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,920
that new of them keep growing

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,000
they grow close enough to each other

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,319
where these connections can be made

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
you don't have to map out all of the

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,240
connections and make sure that everyone

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,160
has a buddy to reinforcement

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,000
uh if you create a culture where roots

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,880
are spontaneously springing up

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,079
uh may i should have brought in a

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,040
picture of this but if you see like a

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,119
good root system

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,880
the roots are everywhere you can't help

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,359
but to have roots that are close to each

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,720
other

00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,920
so this reinforcement of a behavior

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,200
behavior can happen now uh

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,720
i i haven't i haven't actually um

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,000
i'm gonna well let me just do this

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,599
summarize first and then we'll we'll get

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
to the teaser of what's next

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,440
uh so i want to summarize here um

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,880
intersource wave working completely

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,880
makes sense for these broad

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,960
platform type software projects we've

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,359
seen it with 100 or more companies

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,880
involved in your source comments and

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,160
it's a culture change it needs to be

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,319
thought of that way

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,599
we're not on our own in bringing about

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,480
culture change in a corporate

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,960
environment there are

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,760
documented patterns uh that can be

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,079
applied

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,200
and work and these documented patterns

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
aren't just antidote

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,599
anecdotal they are entirely consistent

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,319
and backed up by academic research

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,920
around how behavior spreads how behavior

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,000
threads in a society

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,160
um so as i said i'm going to wrap up

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,680
here with my my contact information

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,920
but what i haven't had time to do here

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
today is assuming you're about into this

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
way of working

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,319
what are some specific things that you

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,960
can do uh to bring more

00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,920
open source uh inspired practices into

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,680
your company

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,200
uh to bring more in more open

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,480
collaboration that leads to an air

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,760
source way of working

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,960
uh so we're not gonna have time to get

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,560
into that today maybe a little bit in

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,880
the questions we can talk about

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,960
uh but i will be and i wanna invite you

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,520
all i'll be speaking next month at open

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,240
source

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,240
lisbon and getting much more specific

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,839
about categories of things

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,079
that you can bring in to move a

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,200
particular team a particular individual

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,119
or your company

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,280
uh more toward the open collaboration

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,359
habits that come from open source

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,720
and will yield robust inner source so

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,240
get much more specific

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,720
around the categories of activities you

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,319
can do and give a rubric for when they

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,480
make sense to bring in

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,520
and kind of i don't know if we'd all

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,520
pick uh

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,640
everything that happened to us this year

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,040
but with the virus

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,240
and everything being virtual everyone

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,720
can attend open source

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,319
lisbon uh so i forget the exact website

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,520
but you search for it's probably open

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,520
source lisbon.com

00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,960
or if not you'll find it very quickly uh

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,280
you can go there and i have a talk there

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,480
where

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,160
we kind of get to the next level

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,599
specificity but assuming these

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,520
principles are true what are some

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,520
categories of things you can do

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,520
and when do they make sense so we'll

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,680
have some time for questions here

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,960
and i'm totally happy and i'd love to

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,400
meet and talk with you more i want to

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
invite you to find me

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,240
on the intersource commons slack you can

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,720
find an invite to that uh

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,920
on the intersource commons.org website

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,079
we can chat in slack

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
you can email me first name last name at

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,040
outlook.com

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,400
happy to talk to you there and then we

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,520
also have time

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,720
uh for questions now so thank you and uh

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,560
if you have a question or

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,880
or if you don't uh if you have these

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,400
last few minutes to take the time to

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,800
fill out the survey i would love to get

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,240
your feedback on things that made sense

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,280
or things that you want to know more

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,040
about uh so as i continue to share

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,880
uh you know here and elsewhere i can do

00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,000
the the best job explaining the things

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,040
that i've learned

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,640
so copy the bitly link or get your phone

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,760
out and scan the qr code fill out the

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,359
survey on your phone

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,319
i'd love to hear more and get your

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,200
feedback with that thanks so much and

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,079
have the balance of time for questions

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,160
hey russell

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,400
so thank you so much for a powerful

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,079
presentation we do have one question in

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,040
the q a

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,680
um if you could look at that you said

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,640
small

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,160
team and large company where 90 of

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,520
commits go to the inner

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,640
source repos can you share those numbers

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,720
this is coming from michael yeah hi

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,119
michael i think we might have met before

00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,240
at some point too it's good to see you

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,040
um

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,760
okay small team and large company so our

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,319
uh

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,280
we started out with the team of of of

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,359
xero

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
and with the team of xero and a

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,040
volunteer development community

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:44,319
we were able to have four projects

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:47,920
and that would be kind of in the

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:50,880
um i would say in the tens of commits

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,160
a week we did get a funded team and for

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,800
a long time we're

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,839
a team of four people that was their

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,000
study size

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,280
it was myself kind of ended up being the

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,880
product owner and manager

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,480
didn't do a lot of coding but three

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,079
full-time engineers

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,599
they were about half and half between

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,079
managing the community and then

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,480
committing

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,760
to the project themselves and with the

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,800
four of us

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,839
and a company of about uh

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,280
2000 engineers we had

00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:21,920
90 of those commits i do not remember

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,960
the number of commits but there are 188

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,559
projects

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,599
i think out of 197 we're using our

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,640
our deployment pipeline so uh to be

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,640
to be precise 90 of projects

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,079
were on our deployment pipeline and then

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,960
all commits to those

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,720
projects so i i can't say you know for

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,440
sure how many would that be

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
uh every week um you know i'm guessing

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,280
you know

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,839
somewhere you know somewhere in the

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,839
range of a thousand or more

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,240
uh do i call out the next question and

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,440
answer uh

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,160
uh yeah yeah well we're kind of out of

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,800
time

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,520
let's see oh did i go to the end i'm

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,359
sorry

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,559
yeah it's 3 20 and i have to get ready

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,559
for the next session

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,000
um oh i thought we had until the half

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,119
hour sorry okay

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,359
no that's okay um really quickly

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,880
so um early in the talk i was wondering

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,520
the leverage factor especially since you

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,800
mentioned

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,640
activation size later

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,839
can you elaborate on that for um

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,920
michael's question

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,160
and his second question can you share a

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,119
bit of how that experience meant to

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,680
complex con

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,680
contagions yeah it sounds like michael

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,960
and i need to get some uh time together

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,359
this is awesome um yeah so so the key

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,119
with

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:42,240
uh leverage factor um let me let me go

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:45,200
let me go back to here uh the key with

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,480
leverage factor and activation size i

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,960
think a lot of it is a

00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,000
percentage of the mind share the company

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,079
can be very big

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,119
but if you can have a tight knit or a

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,559
clique

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:59,680
a set of of reinforcement

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,119
you can uh even though 90

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,440
of the company has nothing to do with

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,200
what you're doing uh in the world

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,559
or from the perspective of the

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,760
individual from their

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,559
world uh if you can occupy a significant

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,200
percentage

00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,079
of their direct connections that's

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,400
what's important

00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,760
so the other thousands of people whether

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,800
or not they're engaging behavior really

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,720
doesn't matter

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,079
uh you know this this this graph could

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,240
be like totally huge

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,520
but if the five or six people that are

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,119
most important to me

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,880
if two or three of them are engaging the

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,960
new behavior and i'm finding value

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,880
to it it's enough so leverage and

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,880
activation size are really

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,000
uh relative to the particular node in

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,680
the network that you're trying to

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,559
activate rather than the total size of

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,520
the network

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,800
and what we did was uh we created a

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,880
separate space

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,040
for those participating together we had

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,040
a weekly meet up four hours

00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,319
every friday where people who were in

00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,680
the development community would get

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,119
together physically

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,680
and that was a space whereby they could

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,119
uh we could maintain on purpose we

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,680
didn't know the time we were like

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,720
intentionally maintaining uh those

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
reinforcement

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,160
connections whereas otherwise they might

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,760
have died out and because

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,359
those reinforcement connections were

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,920
maintained through the space that we set

00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,079
up

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,839
uh people always had that activating

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,680
input even when they weren't getting it

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,440
from being a part of their normal team

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,359
so we could have like one person on

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,359
on a squad or a team remain totally

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,280
activated even though no one else is

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,280
because we kept drawing them out

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
into the meet up of others who were

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,760
activated and they kept themselves hot

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:36,160
and live

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:36,160
